    "      \"content\": \"\"\"## Multi-Label Analysis of \"Local\" Identity Definition Standards in Social Network Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the given social media text segment to identify the prominent standards that the **author themself** explicitly expresses agreement with, or **implicitly agrees with** through the subtext, for defining a **\"local person\" (or its synonyms)**. Based on the Recognition Logic (RL) framework in this manual, output all corresponding RL category labels. A text segment may correspond to **one or more** RL categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Limitation:** This task **only focuses** on how the author defines \"local person\" identity. If the text merely discusses wealth, social status, quality of life, property advantages/disadvantages, job quality, etc., **without explicitly or strongly implying** that these are standards used to judge whether someone is a \"local person,\" then **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Core Principles\n",
    "*   **Focus on the Author's Core Argument:** Your judgment **must** be based on the core viewpoint, claim, or evaluation regarding the definition of \"local person\" identity as presented by the **speaker (i.e., the text author)**. Understanding **what the author intends to say** is the primary task.\n",
    "*   **Analyze the Functional Role of Recognition Logic:** The identified recognition logic elements are not just isolated features; understand the **functional role** they play in the author's construction of their core argument.\n",
    "*   **Actively Infer Context and Implicit Logic:** Actively perform contextual reasoning to understand the basis of legitimacy for \"local person\" identity or the evaluation criteria endorsed by the author behind their discourse.\n",
    "*   **Exclude Resisted Standards and Irrelevant Discussions:** For standards that the author explicitly expresses resistance to, denies, or merely describes as being used against them by others, **do not annotate**. For discussions not directly related to defining \"local person\" identity, **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recognition Logic Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform Sentence Template:**\n",
    "The author believes that people (or the author themself) should/often/can use the logic or standards represented by [Recognition Logic Type] to define who is/is not a 'local person', or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recognition Logic Type Definitions and Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories that the author endorses or describes. These perceptions are not based on official administrative boundaries but reflect collective emotional maps, used as cultural shorthand for assigning evaluative or symbolic labels.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   The author explicitly proposes or assumes a logic for classifying **which areas \"count\" or \"do not count\" as core local areas, or which areas have identity or cognitive differences** (e.g., \"Outside the Third Ring Road is not considered Chengdu\").\n",
    "    *   The author implies the status of a specific area within the \"local\" identity system by describing its **symbolic meaning, historical labels, or common societal views (collective emotional map)**.\n",
    "    *   The author discusses **the social recognition changes or current consensus on concepts like \"urban area scope,\" \"city boundaries,\" etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 2 (RL2): Administrative Legitimacy\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Appeals to official jurisdiction, legal status, or administrative designation. Speakers in this category justify inclusion or exclusion based on hukou registration (a household registration system), district incorporation, or municipal redistricting.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Keywords include \"administrative division,\" \"incorporated into,\" \"belongs to,\" \"where is the hukou from,\" \"ID card prefix,\" etc., used as a basis for judging whether a person/place is administratively/legally \"local.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness (Family Historical Roots / Individual Growth History)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of local legitimacy based on the generational depth of family settlement. Claims in this category emphasize lineage, ancestry, or long-term familial ties to the area.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Emphasizes terms like \"**born and raised locally**,\" \"**generations**,\" \"**ancestors**,\" \"**parents' generation**,\" \"**within three generations**,\" \"**came since childhood/kindergarten**,\" etc., to prove someone is a \"genuine local\" or has formed the basis of a \"local person's\" identity.\n",
    "    *   Describes identity differences due to migration history (or lack thereof).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Relies on dialect, accent, or cultural linguistic habits as a boundary marker. Regional speech features are treated as proxies for insider status, and deviations often provoke mockery or mistrust. May also include identification with specific local cultural habits (e.g., customs, lifestyle).\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions \"speaking the local dialect,\" \"accent,\" \"cannot understand/stand certain accents,\" \"don't you understand our local rules,\" etc., as criteria for distinguishing insiders from outsiders, or judging if someone is \"one of us\" or possesses \"local attributes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 5 (RL5): Functional Livability (Convenience of Living Functions and Environmental Quality Perception)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of urban areas in terms of their material infrastructure (e.g., transit, housing, education, or access to services), often to assert spatial superiority or desirability.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"subway,\" \"amenities,\" \"convenience,\" \"education,\" \"good greening,\" \"few people,\" \"streetscape,\" \"comfortable,\" etc., and **directly associates these with an evaluation of whether an area is \"good,\" \"livable,\" or \"worth living in.\"**\n",
    "    *   The author considers an area an ideal \"local\" living space due to its RL5 characteristics, or believes an area does not meet the standard of a \"good local\" area due to a lack of RL5 characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites judging whether someone is a local based on their integration into local social circles and possession of local fixed assets. This includes community resources (like dividends, familiarity with the community) and material or symbolic resources, such as (inherited) property.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"connections (renmai),\" \"dividends,\" \"old relationships,\" \"community influence,\" \"friends nearby,\" \"has several properties in the city center,\" \"impact of high/low housing prices on identity,\" \"spending one or two million to buy a house,\" etc., and **explicitly or implicitly links these to the \"stability, authenticity, hierarchy of local identity, or evaluation criteria for a region.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 7 (RL7): Occupational Typification\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites framing identity by associating certain districts with dominant professional groups, such as civil servants, migrant workers, or business owners, thereby invoking implicit hierarchies of class and worth.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions specific occupations or types of people (e.g., \"farmers,\" \"those who farm,\" \"migrant workers\"), and **strongly associates them with the \"local attributes,\" resident composition, or social stratification of a specific area**, thereby defining identity or evaluating the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Annotation Procedure\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text**\n",
    "    *   Read through the text and record the entities mentioned.\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity**\n",
    "    *   Read the text carefully and match the corresponding viewpoint statements to each mentioned entity.\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement**\n",
    "    *   For each entity, analyze which recognition logic(s) the speaker's expressed viewpoint (if any) is based on. It can be multiple recognition logics.\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Output the results**\n",
    "    *   Output all matched **one or more** recognition logic category labels [Recognition Logic N], separated by ``, `` (a comma followed by a space).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Important Notes\n",
    "*   Constantly remind yourself that the annotation target is **standards that the author themself does not explicitly oppose and uses to define \"local person\" identity or evaluate a \"local\" area, and understand their function in the author's core argument.**\n",
    "*   Do not rely solely on keyword matching; deeply understand the logic, intent, and core viewpoint behind the author's discourse. **Follow the steps from Step 1 to Step 4 in 4. Annotation Procedure; do not skip steps.**\n",
    "*   If the author is merely describing a phenomenon, expressing personal preference, or evaluating social status/wealth, without revealing that they use these standards to define \"who is a local person\" or evaluate \"the quality/scope/distinction of a local area,\" then **do not annotate.**\n",
    "*   Output the result after the `Output: ` marker. **Stop immediately** after outputting the result; do not output any further content.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the given social media text segment to identify the prominent standards that the **author themself** explicitly expresses agreement with, or **implicitly agrees with** through the subtext, for defining a **\"local person\" (or its synonyms)**. Based on the Recognition Logic (RL) framework in this manual, output all corresponding RL category labels. A text segment may correspond to **one or more** RL categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Limitation:** This task **only focuses** on how the author defines \"local person\" identity. If the text merely discusses wealth, social status, quality of life, property advantages/disadvantages, job quality, etc., **without explicitly or strongly implying** that these are standards used to judge whether someone is a \"local person,\" then **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Core Principles\n",
    "*   **Focus on the Author's Core Argument:** Your judgment **must** be based on the core viewpoint, claim, or evaluation regarding the definition of \"local person\" identity as presented by the **speaker (i.e., the text author)**. Understanding **what the author intends to say** is the primary task.\n",
    "*   **Analyze the Functional Role of Recognition Logic:** The identified recognition logic elements are not just isolated features; understand the **functional role** they play in the author's construction of their core argument.\n",
    "*   **Actively Infer Context and Implicit Logic:** Actively perform contextual reasoning to understand the basis of legitimacy for \"local person\" identity or the evaluation criteria endorsed by the author behind their discourse.\n",
    "*   **Exclude Resisted Standards and Irrelevant Discussions:** For standards that the author explicitly expresses resistance to, denies, or merely describes as being used against them by others, **do not annotate**. For discussions not directly related to defining \"local person\" identity, **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recognition Logic Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform Sentence Template:**\n",
    "The author believes that people (or the author themself) should/often/can use the logic or standards represented by [Recognition Logic Type] to define who is/is not a 'local person', or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recognition Logic Type Definitions and Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories that the author endorses or describes. These perceptions are not based on official administrative boundaries but reflect collective emotional maps, used as cultural shorthand for assigning evaluative or symbolic labels.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   The author explicitly proposes or assumes a logic for classifying **which areas \"count\" or \"do not count\" as core local areas, or which areas have identity or cognitive differences** (e.g., \"Outside the Third Ring Road is not considered Chengdu\").\n",
    "    *   The author implies the status of a specific area within the \"local\" identity system by describing its **symbolic meaning, historical labels, or common societal views (collective emotional map)**.\n",
    "    *   The author discusses **the social recognition changes or current consensus on concepts like \"urban area scope,\" \"city boundaries,\" etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 2 (RL2): Administrative Legitimacy\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Appeals to official jurisdiction, legal status, or administrative designation. Speakers in this category justify inclusion or exclusion based on hukou registration (a household registration system), district incorporation, or municipal redistricting.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Keywords include \"administrative division,\" \"incorporated into,\" \"belongs to,\" \"where is the hukou from,\" \"ID card prefix,\" etc., used as a basis for judging whether a person/place is administratively/legally \"local.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness (Family Historical Roots / Individual Growth History)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of local legitimacy based on the generational depth of family settlement. Claims in this category emphasize lineage, ancestry, or long-term familial ties to the area.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Emphasizes terms like \"**born and raised locally**,\" \"**generations**,\" \"**ancestors**,\" \"**parents' generation**,\" \"**within three generations**,\" \"**came since childhood/kindergarten**,\" etc., to prove someone is a \"genuine local\" or has formed the basis of a \"local person's\" identity.\n",
    "    *   Describes identity differences due to migration history (or lack thereof).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Relies on dialect, accent, or cultural linguistic habits as a boundary marker. Regional speech features are treated as proxies for insider status, and deviations often provoke mockery or mistrust. May also include identification with specific local cultural habits (e.g., customs, lifestyle).\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions \"speaking the local dialect,\" \"accent,\" \"cannot understand/stand certain accents,\" \"don't you understand our local rules,\" etc., as criteria for distinguishing insiders from outsiders, or judging if someone is \"one of us\" or possesses \"local attributes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 5 (RL5): Functional Livability (Convenience of Living Functions and Environmental Quality Perception)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of urban areas in terms of their material infrastructure (e.g., transit, housing, education, or access to services), often to assert spatial superiority or desirability.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"subway,\" \"amenities,\" \"convenience,\" \"education,\" \"good greening,\" \"few people,\" \"streetscape,\" \"comfortable,\" etc., and **directly associates these with an evaluation of whether an area is \"good,\" \"livable,\" or \"worth living in.\"**\n",
    "    *   The author considers an area an ideal \"local\" living space due to its RL5 characteristics, or believes an area does not meet the standard of a \"good local\" area due to a lack of RL5 characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites judging whether someone is a local based on their integration into local social circles and possession of local fixed assets. This includes community resources (like dividends, familiarity with the community) and material or symbolic resources, such as (inherited) property.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"connections (renmai),\" \"dividends,\" \"old relationships,\" \"community influence,\" \"friends nearby,\" \"has several properties in the city center,\" \"impact of high/low housing prices on identity,\" \"spending one or two million to buy a house,\" etc., and **explicitly or implicitly links these to the \"stability, authenticity, hierarchy of local identity, or evaluation criteria for a region.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 7 (RL7): Occupational Typification\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites framing identity by associating certain districts with dominant professional groups, such as civil servants, migrant workers, or business owners, thereby invoking implicit hierarchies of class and worth.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions specific occupations or types of people (e.g., \"farmers,\" \"those who farm,\" \"migrant workers\"), and **strongly associates them with the \"local attributes,\" resident composition, or social stratification of a specific area**, thereby defining identity or evaluating the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Annotation Procedure\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text**\n",
    "    *   Read through the text and record the entities mentioned.\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity**\n",
    "    *   Read the text carefully and match the corresponding viewpoint statements to each mentioned entity.\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement**\n",
    "    *   For each entity, analyze which recognition logic(s) the speaker's expressed viewpoint (if any) is based on. It can be multiple recognition logics.\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Output the results**\n",
    "    *   Output all matched **one or more** recognition logic category labels [Recognition Logic N], separated by ``, `` (a comma followed by a space).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Important Notes\n",
    "*   Constantly remind yourself that the annotation target is **standards that the author themself does not explicitly oppose and uses to define \"local person\" identity or evaluate a \"local\" area, and understand their function in the author's core argument.**\n",
    "*   Do not rely solely on keyword matching; deeply understand the logic, intent, and core viewpoint behind the author's discourse. **Follow the steps from Step 1 to Step 4 in 4. Annotation Procedure; do not skip steps.**\n",
    "*   If the author is merely describing a phenomenon, expressing personal preference, or evaluating social status/wealth, without revealing that they use these standards to define \"who is a local person\" or evaluate \"the quality/scope/distinction of a local area,\" then **do not annotate.**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the given social media text segment to identify the prominent standards that the **author themself** explicitly expresses agreement with, or **implicitly agrees with** through the subtext, for defining a **\"local person\" (or its synonyms)**. Based on the Recognition Logic (RL) framework in this manual, output all corresponding RL category labels. A text segment may correspond to **one or more** RL categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Limitation:** This task **only focuses** on how the author defines \"local person\" identity. If the text merely discusses wealth, social status, quality of life, property advantages/disadvantages, job quality, etc., **without explicitly or strongly implying** that these are standards used to judge whether someone is a \"local person,\" then **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Core Principles\n",
    "*   **Focus on the Author's Core Argument:** Your judgment **must** be based on the core viewpoint, claim, or evaluation regarding the definition of \"local person\" identity as presented by the **speaker (i.e., the text author)**. Understanding **what the author intends to say** is the primary task.\n",
    "*   **Analyze the Functional Role of Recognition Logic:** The identified recognition logic elements are not just isolated features; understand the **functional role** they play in the author's construction of their core argument.\n",
    "*   **Actively Infer Context and Implicit Logic:** Actively perform contextual reasoning to understand the basis of legitimacy for \"local person\" identity or the evaluation criteria endorsed by the author behind their discourse.\n",
    "*   **Exclude Resisted Standards and Irrelevant Discussions:** For standards that the author explicitly expresses resistance to, denies, or merely describes as being used against them by others, **do not annotate**. For discussions not directly related to defining \"local person\" identity, **do not annotate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recognition Logic Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform Sentence Template:**\n",
    "The author believes that people (or the author themself) should/often/can use the logic or standards represented by [Recognition Logic Type] to define who is/is not a 'local person', or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recognition Logic Type Definitions and Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories that the author endorses or describes. These perceptions are not based on official administrative boundaries but reflect collective emotional maps, used as cultural shorthand for assigning evaluative or symbolic labels.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   The author explicitly proposes or assumes a logic for classifying **which areas \"count\" or \"do not count\" as core local areas, or which areas have identity or cognitive differences** (e.g., \"Outside the Third Ring Road is not considered Chengdu\").\n",
    "    *   The author implies the status of a specific area within the \"local\" identity system by describing its **symbolic meaning, historical labels, or common societal views (collective emotional map)**.\n",
    "    *   The author discusses **the social recognition changes or current consensus on concepts like \"urban area scope,\" \"city boundaries,\" etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 2 (RL2): Administrative Legitimacy\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Appeals to official jurisdiction, legal status, or administrative designation. Speakers in this category justify inclusion or exclusion based on hukou registration (a household registration system), district incorporation, or municipal redistricting.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Keywords include \"administrative division,\" \"incorporated into,\" \"belongs to,\" \"where is the hukou from,\" \"ID card prefix,\" etc., used as a basis for judging whether a person/place is administratively/legally \"local.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness (Family Historical Roots / Individual Growth History)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of local legitimacy based on the generational depth of family settlement. Claims in this category emphasize lineage, ancestry, or long-term familial ties to the area.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Emphasizes terms like \"**born and raised locally**,\" \"**generations**,\" \"**ancestors**,\" \"**parents' generation**,\" \"**within three generations**,\" \"**came since childhood/kindergarten**,\" etc., to prove someone is a \"genuine local\" or has formed the basis of a \"local person's\" identity.\n",
    "    *   Describes identity differences due to migration history (or lack thereof).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition\n",
    "*   **Definition:** Relies on dialect, accent, or cultural linguistic habits as a boundary marker. Regional speech features are treated as proxies for insider status, and deviations often provoke mockery or mistrust. May also include identification with specific local cultural habits (e.g., customs, lifestyle).\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions \"speaking the local dialect,\" \"accent,\" \"cannot understand/stand certain accents,\" \"don't you understand our local rules,\" etc., as criteria for distinguishing insiders from outsiders, or judging if someone is \"one of us\" or possesses \"local attributes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 5 (RL5): Functional Livability (Convenience of Living Functions and Environmental Quality Perception)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites the evaluation of urban areas in terms of their material infrastructure (e.g., transit, housing, education, or access to services), often to assert spatial superiority or desirability.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"subway,\" \"amenities,\" \"convenience,\" \"education,\" \"good greening,\" \"few people,\" \"streetscape,\" \"comfortable,\" etc., and **directly associates these with an evaluation of whether an area is \"good,\" \"livable,\" or \"worth living in.\"**\n",
    "    *   The author considers an area an ideal \"local\" living space due to its RL5 characteristics, or believes an area does not meet the standard of a \"good local\" area due to a lack of RL5 characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status)\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites judging whether someone is a local based on their integration into local social circles and possession of local fixed assets. This includes community resources (like dividends, familiarity with the community) and material or symbolic resources, such as (inherited) property.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:**\n",
    "    *   Mentions \"connections (renmai),\" \"dividends,\" \"old relationships,\" \"community influence,\" \"friends nearby,\" \"has several properties in the city center,\" \"impact of high/low housing prices on identity,\" \"spending one or two million to buy a house,\" etc., and **explicitly or implicitly links these to the \"stability, authenticity, hierarchy of local identity, or evaluation criteria for a region.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition Logic 7 (RL7): Occupational Typification\n",
    "*   **Definition:** The author endorses or cites framing identity by associating certain districts with dominant professional groups, such as civil servants, migrant workers, or business owners, thereby invoking implicit hierarchies of class and worth.\n",
    "*   **Core Identifying Features:** Mentions specific occupations or types of people (e.g., \"farmers,\" \"those who farm,\" \"migrant workers\"), and **strongly associates them with the \"local attributes,\" resident composition, or social stratification of a specific area**, thereby defining identity or evaluating the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Important Notes\n",
    "*   Constantly remind yourself that the annotation target is **standards that the author themself does not explicitly oppose and uses to define \"local person\" identity or evaluate a \"local\" area, and understand their function in the author's core argument.**\n",
    "*   If the author is merely describing a phenomenon, expressing personal preference, or evaluating social status/wealth, without revealing that they use these standards to define \"who is a local person\" or evaluate \"the quality/scope/distinction of a local area,\" then **do not annotate.**\n",
