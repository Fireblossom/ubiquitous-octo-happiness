热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,"Output: RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 叙北第一带盐人 (a group or area in the north of X)
- 北门 (North Gate)
- 三环外 (Outside the Third Ring Road)
- 东西三环 (East-West Third Ring)
- 北三环 (North Third Ring)
- 火北 (likely a place or area under development)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author welcomes ""叙北第一带盐人"" warmly, implying recognition of this group or area's identity.
- ""北门可不差"" means ""North Gate is not bad.""
- ""论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" means ""Regarding areas outside the Third Ring Road, the East-West Third Ring is not necessarily better than the North Third Ring.""
- ""再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了"" means ""Once Huobei (火北) is completed, it will really take off.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes between different spatial areas within the city (North Gate, North Third Ring, East-West Third Ring, outside the Third Ring Road).
- The author evaluates these areas comparatively in terms of quality or desirability (""not bad,"" ""not necessarily better,"" ""will take off"").
- This reflects a shared local perception of spatial hierarchy and symbolic meanings of different city areas.
- The author implies that certain spatial areas have different status or desirability in local identity or living standards.
- The author uses spatial categories that are not formal administrative boundaries but local spatial markers (ring roads, named gates, etc.).
- This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it is about local perceptions and spatial classifications.
- Also, the author evaluates areas based on their potential or current livability and development (""not bad,"" ""will take off""), which relates to RL5 (Functional Livability).
- However, the author does not explicitly link these to administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The main focus is on spatial perception and livability evaluation.

真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL4","Step 1: Identify named entities:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 都江堰 (Dujiangyan)
- 四川 (Sichuan)
- 二环 (Second Ring Road)
- 市中心 (city center)
- 周边 (surrounding areas)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author is from 周边 (surrounding area).
- Others claim that only inside 二环 (Second Ring Road) is considered Chengdu; outside 二环 is ""Sichuan"" (implying not Chengdu).
- There is a social perception that 市中心 locals do not require bride price, but 周边 locals do.
- Comments under videos criticize people based on their local accent.
- Someone implied that only people from inside 二环 are true Chengdu locals.
- The author mentions being mocked as ""弯脚杆"" (a local derogatory term) by some Chengdu gay people.
- The author uses the location 都江堰 (a surrounding area) to identify themselves as from Chengdu, but others deny that.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- The distinction based on 二环以内 (inside Second Ring Road) vs. 二环以外 (outside Second Ring Road) as defining whether someone is a ""real"" Chengdu local fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority). This is a collective emotional map of what areas count as ""local.""

- The mention of ""口音"" (accent) as a basis for criticism and distinguishing locals fits RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

- The distinction between 市中心 locals and 周边 locals regarding bride price relates to social/cultural distinctions but is more about social embeddedness or family rootedness? The author reports that 市中心 locals do not require bride price, 周边 locals do. This reflects an insider vs outsider local identity boundary.

- The author does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2), nor family rootedness (RL3), nor functional livability (RL5), nor occupational typification (RL7).

- The social embeddedness (RL6) might be implied via bride price and social recognition differences between 市中心 and 周边, but the author mainly reports others' views and does not explicitly endorse it.

我是都江堰的，其他地方的我不敢说，但是我可是从小被成都口音嘲笑哦，我小时候去亲戚家耍过暑假，我说吃饭他们就笑我口音，现在去成都我都不敢开腔，有时候买东西都说普通话，经历过很多次被恶意学我说话,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 都江堰 (Dujiangyan)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author says they are from 都江堰.
- The author mentions being mocked for their 成都 (Chengdu) accent when speaking.
- The author implies that speaking with a non-local accent (i.e., not the Chengdu dialect) leads to social exclusion or discrimination.
- The author avoids speaking the local dialect in 成都 due to fear of mockery.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes that local identity is recognized or evaluated based on dialect/accent, as they are mocked for their accent and feel compelled to speak standard Mandarin.
- This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), which uses dialect/accent as a boundary marker for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results.

那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,"RL1, RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 都江堰话 (Dujiangyan dialect)
- 成都人 (Chengdu person)
- 二环以内 (inside the Second Ring Road)
- 宽窄巷子 (Kuanzhai Alley)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author says ""都江堰话被笑的更多"" (Dujiangyan dialect is laughed at more), implying linguistic difference and mockery based on dialect.
- The author describes a Chengdu person boasting about family origins inside the Second Ring Road and Kuanzhai Alley, which are symbolic local areas.
- The author expresses annoyance at the boasting and pretentiousness linked to these specific places.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of dialect being mocked as a marker of identity corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The emphasis on family origins ""以前二环以内"" (previously inside the Second Ring Road) and ""以前宽窄巷子"" (previously Kuanzhai Alley) as points of pride or boasting corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because these are habitual local perceptions of core local areas used as identity markers.

那证明成都人的确不咋地，本来成都话口音离普通话语区就够偏了，很多怪音，他们还歧视本省的人，无语了都，儿化音就像大舌头一样，这是外地人评价的，为什么有些区县的来到成都要模仿他们的口音，本来就难听还要模仿是自己也不自信，大胆保持自己的地方本土特色有什么？,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 本省的人 (people from the same province)
- 区县 (districts and counties within the province)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author discusses the Chengdu dialect accent as deviating significantly from standard Mandarin, mentioning ""很多怪音"" (many strange sounds) and the ""儿化音"" (erhua sound) being like a lisp.
- The author mentions that some districts/counties coming to Chengdu imitate the Chengdu accent, which the author criticizes as lacking confidence in their own local dialect.
- The author expresses dissatisfaction with the Chengdu accent and the social dynamics around it, including that people discriminate against locals from the same province.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The focus is on dialect and accent as a boundary marker for local identity (""成都话口音离普通话语区够偏了"", ""儿化音像大舌头"", ""模仿他们的口音"", ""大胆保持自己的地方本土特色"").
- This clearly aligns with Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, because the author uses dialect/accent and cultural linguistic habits as a criterion to distinguish local identity or insider status.
- The author implicitly criticizes those who imitate the Chengdu accent and encourages maintaining local dialect features, which indicates the author endorses dialect as a standard for local identity.

No other recognition logics are supported by the text.

- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The friend is from Dujiangyan but has been living in Chengdu for over ten years and now speaks with a Chengdu accent.
- The author guesses the friend changed accent to avoid difficulty integrating.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies that speaking the local (Chengdu) dialect or accent is important for integration and local identity.
- This suggests the author sees linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as a standard for defining or evaluating ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output the results:

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 一环内 (Inside the First Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions that locals can recognize someone is not from Chengdu (specifically from inside the First Ring Road) by their accent.
- The author implies that the local accent (口音) is a clear marker of being a local or not.
- The author also notes locals are very friendly to outsiders, but the accent difference is a clear boundary.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses accent/dialect as a criterion to identify who is a local person (""土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显"").
- This fits RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to entities:
- The author is from 内江, adjacent to 自贡 direction, and speaks pure 自贡 dialect.
- The author has lived in 成都 for over ten years and bought a house inside the First Ring Road.
- The author still speaks pure 自贡 dialect.
- The author believes speaking is for communication; understanding is what matters, origin does not.
- The author does not worry about accent or others' opinions and considers those who judge by accent as superficial.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes dialect/accent (""纯正自贡口音"") as a notable feature but rejects the idea that origin or accent defines local identity. They say origin is ""not important"" and do not care about others' views on accent.
- The author does not use administrative boundaries or hukou to define local identity.
- The mention of buying a house inside the First Ring Road indicates residence but is not linked to defining ""local person"" identity.
- The author explicitly rejects judging local identity by accent.
- Therefore, no RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) is endorsed.
- No other RL categories are explicitly or implicitly used by the author to define local identity.

你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specifically named, but the text refers to ""我们口音"" (our accent).

Step 2: The statement ""你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱"" implies a mention of accent as a marker, with a negative evaluation of ""our accent"" by someone else, but the author references it.

Step 3: The author refers to ""口音"" (accent) as a criterion used in defining local identity or distinguishing locals from outsiders. Although the tone is negative (""很贱"" - very bad), the mention shows that accent is recognized as a standard in local identity discourse.

Step 4: The author acknowledges the role of accent in defining local identity, corresponding to Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Output: RL4"

重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小，重要是带不带口音口音改不到撒,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 房子 (houses/property)
- 口音 (accent)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that the number of houses or their location or condition (""是不是老破小"") is not important.
- The important factor is whether one has the local accent or not (""带不带口音""), and that the accent cannot be changed (""口音改不到"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes accent as a key criterion for defining a local person.
- The author dismisses property ownership or quality as important criteria.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, because the author uses accent as a boundary marker for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results:

Step 2: Matching arguments:
- The author questions whether they count as a ""Chengdu person.""
- Father's family (father, grandparents) are from Chengdu.
- The author's hukou (household registration) is in Chengdu.
- The mother is from another city; the author grew up in the mother's city.
- The author experienced being called ""乡巴佬"" (hillbilly, outsider) when playing with kids in Chengdu during holidays.
- The author only returned to Chengdu for graduate school and then went abroad.
- The author has been back in Chengdu for almost 3 years but cannot speak Chengdu dialect fluently, only understands it and speaks Sichuan dialect with an accent.
- The author feels a lack of identification with Chengdu.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions ""爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都"" and ""我户口在成都,"" which indicate family roots and administrative legitimacy.
- ""爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都"" corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- ""我户口在成都"" corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author notes language/dialect issues: ""不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话，总被同事说我说的四川话有口音,"" indicating linguistic-cultural recognition as a factor in local identity. This corresponds to RL4.
- The author experienced social exclusion (""被骂乡巴佬"") due to linguistic or cultural differences, further supporting RL4.
- The author expresses a lack of identification despite family roots and hukou, implying the linguistic-cultural aspect impacts local identity recognition.

一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific (general mention of ""a dialect"" and ""a face"").

Step 2: The author mentions ""a dialect"" and ""a face"" and says ""we are daily cyberbullied, not even daring to go out."" The focus is on the dialect (口音) and appearance (面) as bases for social exclusion or judgment.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""a dialect"" (口音) as a basis for social exclusion or identity judgment aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The mention of ""a face"" (面) might relate to physical appearance or possibly social image, but since the task is about defining ""local person"" identity and ""face"" is not clearly linked to any RL category, and no explicit standard is indicated, it is not annotated.
- The core is the dialect being a criterion for local identity or social acceptance.

Step 4: Output the recognized logic.

就是。。。基本上现在接到那些骚扰电话都是外地口音哎，不是歧视外地人，只是觉得如果他们回老家，做点其他工作，也比鼓捣留在成都打骚扰电话好嘛,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- ""外地"" (non-local places or people)
- ""成都"" (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions that most spam calls now come from people with non-local accents.
- The author says this is not discrimination against non-locals but implies a negative view of these outsiders staying in Chengdu to make spam calls.
- The author suggests these people would be better off returning to their hometowns to do other work.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""外地口音"" (non-local accents) as a distinguishing factor for these people shows the author uses linguistic-cultural features to differentiate locals and non-locals.
- The author implicitly considers local identity connected to accent or dialect, as the negative attribute is linked to ""外地口音"".
- There is no explicit mention of administrative status, family roots, or vernacular spatial authority.
- The author does not explicitly define ""local person"" identity but implies linguistic-cultural recognition is a criterion.
- The discussion of occupation (""打骚扰电话"") is negative but not used to define local identity per se.
- The author explicitly says ""不是歧视外地人"" (not discriminating), but the logic still uses accent as a boundary.

Step 4: Output the result:

之前在成都上学遇到两个女的 就不是成都人 四川其他地方的 非要说自己是成都人 只是亲戚在双流买了房子而已各种也装的要死 我真的想问这有什么好优越的吗自己的土生土长的地方都不承认,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都 (Chengdu), 四川其他地方 (other parts of Sichuan), 双流 (Shuangliu)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author encountered two women who are not from Chengdu, but from other parts of Sichuan.
- These women insist they are Chengdu people just because their relatives bought a house in Shuangliu.
- The author criticizes this behavior, emphasizing that these women do not acknowledge their ""native"" hometowns.
- The author values being ""土生土长"" (born and raised) in the place as a standard of being a true local.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author implies that true ""local person"" status depends on being born and raised locally (""土生土长""), which corresponds to RL3: Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History.
- The mention of relatives buying a house in Shuangliu is used to reject the claim to local identity, suggesting that property ownership alone does not confer local identity. This implies the author rejects RL6 (social embeddedness by property) as a valid standard.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries, dialect, or occupational groups.
- The core standard endorsed is the family rootedness / growth history (RL3).

Output: RL3"
我也想说，我那个农村老板在成都买房了，经常给我说我现在也是成都本地人了，创业初成功经常在那吹嘘自己🐮逼，神戳戳的，他不在别的同事面前说他是成都户口了因为其他人不是土著,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 农村老板 (rural boss)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The rural boss bought a house in Chengdu and claims to be a local person.
- He brags about his entrepreneurial success.
- He does not claim to have a Chengdu hukou (household registration) because others are not ""土著"" (indigenous locals).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The rural boss claims local identity by buying property, implying that owning property is a basis for claiming to be local. This aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness: local property ownership as basis for local identity).
- He does not claim hukou status, indicating that hukou is recognized as a standard for local identity but he does not possess it. The author mentions this to highlight the difference.
- The mention of ""土著"" (indigenous locals) indicates the concept of original local inhabitants, which relates to RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- However, the author does not explicitly endorse or agree with the rural boss's claims, but rather reports the rural boss's behavior and how he behaves with others.

Step 4: Does the author endorse any of these standards as a basis for defining local person identity?
- The author reports the rural boss’s behavior but does not explicitly or implicitly endorse any standard.
- The mention of ""成都户口"" (Chengdu hukou) is described as something the rural boss does not have and does not claim.
- The author does not indicate agreement with property ownership as a standard.
- The author mentions ""土著"" as a concept used by others, but does not explicitly endorse it.

Conclusion: The text mainly describes others' claims and social dynamics but does not show that the author agrees or uses these standards to define ""local person"" identity.

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 二三环 (Second and Third Ring Roads)
- 老一辈 (the older generation)
- 某某地名 (original place names)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author discusses how Chengdu's expansion has blurred the boundaries for the older generation; areas far beyond the Second and Third Ring Roads are now called Chengdu.
- The older generation finds it hard to adapt to these new boundaries and prefers the original place names.
- The author implies the older generation uses a spatial logic to define what counts as ""local"" or ""inside"" Chengdu.
- The mention of navigation time and travel distance supports the idea that these spatial boundaries have real significance.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author implicitly endorses a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1) because they describe how the older generation perceives the core local area differently from the official or expanded boundaries, emphasizing habitual or emotional mapping rather than administrative definitions.
- The author does not mention hukou or administrative divisions explicitly, so RL2 is not applicable.
- No mention of family roots or generational depth explicitly defining ""local person,"" so RL3 not applicable.
- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic markers, so RL4 not applicable.
- No explicit mention of livability or convenience as a criterion for ""local person"" identity, so RL5 not applicable.
- No mention of social embeddedness or property, so RL6 not applicable.
- No mention of occupational types, so RL7 not applicable.

Output: RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 有钱的区域 (wealthy areas)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 成都: The author argues that having wealth does not equal being a local (土著). Most locals just have enough housing and some rental properties, so even with low wages, many live happily. The author also describes the attitude of locals as indifferent to wealth differences.
- 有钱的区域: These wealthy areas are described as mostly for non-locals who come from outside to spend money or settle, implying they are not considered local areas for the ""土著.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes locals (土著) not by wealth or property ownership but by implied family roots or long-term belonging (""土著"" generally implies local lineage). The author negates wealth/property as a criterion for local identity.
- The author implies a recognition logic based on family rootedness or generational belonging (RL3), since locals are identified by being ""土著,"" not by wealth.
- The discussion about wealthy areas belonging mostly to outsiders implies a spatial boundary in local identity, but the author does not explicitly endorse spatial boundaries or emotional maps to define local identity here, only notes that rich areas are not for locals.
- No explicit or implicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy (RL2), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), or social embeddedness (RL6) is observed.
- Wealth and property ownership are discussed but the author explicitly denies these as local identity standards, so RL6 is not endorsed.
- The author does not mention dialect or cultural language, so RL4 is excluded.
- The mention of ""土著"" suggests family rootedness or generational settlement (RL3).

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 三环 (Third Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author identifies as from 崇州.
- People around the author when asked where they are from say 崇州, not 成都.
- The author describes a local perception among 成都 people that areas outside the Third Ring Road are not considered part of 成都.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The statement ""三环以外的不算成都的"" reflects a vernacular spatial authority (RL1), a local collective emotional map or shared perception about city boundaries that differs from administrative definitions.
- The emphasis on people saying 崇州 instead of 成都 indicates the importance of these vernacular spatial boundaries in defining local identity.

Step 4: Output the result:

- ""成都"" (Chengdu)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:  
- The author believes that only those whose families have been born and raised locally since the grandfather's generation count as ""土著"" (local natives).  
- Those who got Chengdu hukou from outside or whose parents came from outside and then had children are not considered true locals.  
- The author implies that many who claim to be Chengdu locals are actually not, based on their family history.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author emphasizes family generational rootedness (""爷爷辈土生土长"") as the key standard for defining a local person.  
- Rejects administrative legitimacy (hukou) as a sufficient criterion.  
- The logic corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).  

Step 4: Output the results:

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author believes that native people in any place tend to have a sense of superiority because they are born and raised locally.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: The author emphasizes being ""土生土长本地人"" (born and raised locally) as the defining standard for being a local person. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author says they are ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" (born and raised in Chengdu), with no accent, feeling very close and familiar when returning.
- The author mentions ""一点口音都没有"" (no accent at all).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses ""born and raised locally"" and ""no accent"" as criteria for defining themselves as a local person.
- ""土生土长"" corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- ""一点口音都没有"" corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

反正我三环外的不是成都人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""三环外"" (Outside the Third Ring Road), ""成都人"" (Chengdu people/local persons).

Step 2: The author states ""反正我三环外的不是成都人"" (""Anyway, those outside the Third Ring Road are not Chengdu people""). This expresses a viewpoint that being inside the Third Ring Road is a criterion for being a ""local person"" of Chengdu.

Step 3: This is a spatial classification based on commonly recognized local spatial boundaries, not administrative or legal boundaries. The author uses the intra-city spatial boundary (Third Ring Road) to define local identity, reflecting a vernacular spatial authority logic.

Output: RL1"
我同学说二环外的都是农民,RL7,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 二环外 (outside the Second Ring Road)

Step 2: The author reports that their classmate says ""二环外的都是农民"" (everyone outside the Second Ring Road are farmers).

Step 3: The author is relaying a viewpoint that associates a spatial area (outside the Second Ring Road) with a social group (farmers), implying a social classification based on spatial location and occupation.

Step 4: The author does not explicitly endorse or oppose this statement, but the statement itself reflects an occupational typification tied to spatial location.

Since the statement links a spatial area (二环外) with an occupational group (农民), this aligns with Recognition Logic 7 (Occupational Typification).

Output: RL7"
歧视三环外的多，还是学生偏多,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road)

Step 2: The author states ""歧视三环外的多"" (more discrimination against people outside the Third Ring Road), and ""学生偏多"" (there are more students). This is a description of social attitudes and population composition outside the Third Ring Road.

Step 3: The author mentions discrimination against people outside the Third Ring Road, implying that the spatial boundary of the Third Ring Road is a significant marker for local identity or social recognition. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it reflects a local spatial perception of identity boundaries.

There is no explicit mention or implication of administrative legitimacy (hukou), family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards the author endorses for defining ""local person.""

Step 4: Output the matched recognition logic.

成都土著的优越感是最强的，没有之一那种。比如他们在强调自己血统纯正的时候，往往会在前面加上土著或土生土长这样的词语。外地的不用说了，还没资格让土生土长的5城区成都人看不起，有资格被看不起的，首先你要是三环外但是大成都的弯脚杆和211，或者是后面来但是获得了成都省护照的新成都。,"RL1, RL2, RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都土著 (Chengdu natives), 五城区成都人 (five urban districts Chengdu people), 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road), 大成都 (Greater Chengdu), 弯脚杆 (a local nickname), 211 (a local nickname), 新成都 (New Chengdu).

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 成都土著 emphasize ""pure bloodline"" with terms like 土著 or 土生土长.
- 五城区成都人 (five urban districts Chengdu people) are considered the core locals who look down on outsiders.
- 三环外 but still 大成都’s 弯脚杆 and 211 are considered less local than five urban districts.
- 新成都 refers to people who came later but have obtained Chengdu ""provincial passport"" (likely hukou).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The use of terms like 土著 or 土生土长 and emphasis on bloodline purity, as well as ""born and raised locally"" suggests RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of 三环外 vs. 五城区 and ""大成都"" suggests a spatial classification of local areas, implying RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""获得了成都省护照"" (obtained Chengdu provincial passport) is a direct reference to administrative status, i.e., hukou or official registration, indicating RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

成华区二环内土著 几十年了没觉得啥子,"RL1, RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成华区, 二环内

Step 2: The author mentions ""成华区二环内土著"" (locals native to Chenghua District inside the Second Ring Road) and says ""几几十年了没觉得啥子"" (have been here for decades, didn't feel anything [negative or unusual]). The author identifies locals based on long-term residence in a specific spatial area.

Step 3: The author uses length of residence (decades) and specific intra-city spatial area (Chenghua District inside the Second Ring Road) to define local identity. This reflects:

- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): because the author references a specific spatial area inside the city (二环内, inside the Second Ring Road), which is a common local spatial boundary in many Chinese cities.

- RL3 (Family Rootedness): ""几十年了"" (several decades) implies long-term local residence, a form of rootedness or family growth history.

Step 4: Output all matched recognition logics.

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 成都土著 (Chengdu local/native)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author identifies themselves as a ""成都土著"" (Chengdu native/local).
- The author mentions ""受不了一些口音"" (cannot stand some accents) but says ""不存在什么问题"" (there is no real problem).
- The author also mentions ""成都本地人也很多撇火药"" (there are many Chengdu locals who also mock others).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""口音"" (accent) as a point of slight annoyance but still a marker indicates the author implicitly agrees that linguistic features are a standard for defining locals.
- The author identifies as a local based on being a ""成都土著,"" which implies RL3 (family rootedness) or RL1 (vernacular spatial authority) but no explicit mention of family roots or spatial boundary.
- The only explicit standard mentioned is accent/口音, which corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Step 4: Output the result:

三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road), 弯脚杆 (a local nickname for a place or group)

Step 2: The author mentions ""三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个"" which roughly means ""How can those from outside the Third Ring Road (the '弯脚杆') dare to look down on anyone?"" This implies that the author is referencing the spatial boundary of the Third Ring Road as a criterion for defining local identity or status.

Step 3: The author uses the spatial boundary (inside or outside the Third Ring Road) as a standard for local identity, reflecting a vernacular spatial authority. This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (RL1).

Step 4: Output the result.

- 市中心 (city center)
- 天府新区 (Tianfu New Area)
- 三环内 (inside the Third Ring Road)
- 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author states that ""三环内土著"" (locals inside the Third Ring Road) do not discriminate against outsiders but discriminate against people from outside the Third Ring Road.
- The author identifies as a 本土著 (local native) who recently moved from the city center to Tianfu New Area.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The distinction between 三环内 and 三环外 (inside/outside the Third Ring Road) as a boundary for ""locals"" indicates an emotional/spatial classification beyond administrative boundaries.
- The discrimination mentioned is based on this spatial boundary, which reflects vernacular spatial authority.
- No mention of hukou or administrative divisions.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, or social embeddedness.
- No mention of functional livability or occupation.

- 二环 (Second Ring Road area)
- 青白江 (Qingbaijiang district)
- 乡坝头 (a rural or suburban area, implied by the term)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The colleague's husband lives in the Second Ring Road area and owns a house there, but his hukou (household registration) is in Qingbaijiang.
- The husband's relatives mock or speak disparagingly of the ""乡坝头"" area.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""户口是青白江的"" (hukou is Qingbaijiang) indicates that hukou registration is used as a criterion to define or judge ""local person"" identity. This aligns with Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The relatives' disparaging remarks towards ""乡坝头"" imply a vernacular spatial classification or cultural stereotype about certain areas, which relates to Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

三环边边 不敢说是土著 走到一环二环都说进城 不敢开车 怕遭说,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 三环边边 (edge of Third Ring Road), 一环二环 (First and Second Ring Road)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""三环边边 不敢说是土著"" (""At the edge of the Third Ring Road, [I] dare not say [I am] a local/native"")
- ""走到一环二环都说进城"" (""When going to First and Second Ring Road areas, they say it's 'entering the city'"")
- ""不敢开车 怕遭说"" (""Dare not drive, afraid of being talked about"")

The author seems to discuss the spatial perception of what counts as ""local"" or ""native"" — being inside the first or second ring roads is considered ""entering the city,"" implying that areas outside are less 'central' or 'local.' The author hesitates to claim ""native"" identity at the edge of the third ring road.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses spatial boundaries defined by ring roads to judge who can be considered ""土著"" (native/local person).
- This corresponds to RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author uses intra-city spatial categories (ring roads) as a local perception of ""local"" identity.
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 4: Output result:

Step 2: The author states that ""三环外不配"" (outside the Third Ring Road does not qualify), implying a spatial boundary for who counts as a local person or local area.

Step 3: This is an example of Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1), as the author uses a habitual, culturally shared perception of spatial boundaries (inside vs. outside the Third Ring Road) to define local identity.

Step 4: Output the result.

- 一环路 (First Ring Road)
- 四川其他地方的朋友 (friends from other parts of Sichuan)
- 成都朋友 (Chengdu friends)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author identifies as ""一环路穷土著"" (a poor native from First Ring Road) and denies feeling superior.
- Some friends from other parts of Sichuan suspect the author might have a sense of superiority.
- Chengdu friends speaking Chengdu dialect outside are accused by uninformed people of faking the accent to pretend to be from Chengdu.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""一环路穷土著"" indicates a spatially based identity tied to a specific local area (First Ring Road). The author uses this to claim local native status, implying a spatial identity based on local area (RL1).
- The discussion about speaking ""成都话"" (Chengdu dialect) and being accused of faking it relates to linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for local identity (RL4).

Step 4: Output:

- Since the author does not endorse any RL category as a standard for defining ""local person,"" and explicitly says it ""has little to do"" with being a local, no RL categories apply.

Output:","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都土著 (Chengdu locals), 成都嬢嬢 (Chengdu ladies)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- Regarding 成都土著, the author says it is ""not much related"" to being a local (土著), but rather depends on personal quality (个人素质).
- The author mentions having stayed in Chengdu for over 10 years and that most Chengdu locals are good.
- The mention of 成都嬢嬢 introducing matches is anecdotal and does not establish a standard for defining ""local person.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly denies that ""being a local"" (成都土著) is strongly connected to the local identity, instead emphasizing personal qualities.
- The author does not mention any of the RL categories such as administrative status, family roots, dialect, or spatial authority as defining local identity.
- The author also does not discuss any social embeddedness, occupational typification, or livability standards as defining local identity.
- The emphasis on personal quality is not part of the RL framework for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output results:
- Since the author does not endorse any RL category as a standard for defining ""local person,"" and explicitly says it ""has little to do"" with being a local, no RL categories apply.

Step 2: The author states their family is from Chengdu suburbs and they live with parents in Chengdu. When asked, they say they are from a certain suburb, but others say ""You are Chengdu people"" in a sarcastic way.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:

- The author mentions family origin (老家是成都郊区) and living situation (跟父母常年住在成都), which relates to family rootedness and growth history.

- The author uses their family origin to define their identity (they say they are from the suburb), so this reflects RL3: Family Rootedness.

- There is also an implicit contrast between suburb vs city identity, which may relate to RL1 (vernacular spatial authority), but the author does not explicitly endorse or use the spatial categories to define local person identity; they only mention others' reaction.

- The main standard the author uses is their family origin and residence to define local person identity.

Step 2: The author mentions that ""土著"" (local/native people) have been mocked for their accent, expressing disapproval of this mockery. This implies the author recognizes accent (linguistic features) as a criterion associated with ""local"" identity.

Step 3: The author implicitly agrees that accent or dialect is a standard used to define or recognize ""local people,"" as the mockery is based on this linguistic difference. Therefore, this aligns with Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

- 成都人 (Chengdu people)
- 外地人 (non-locals/outlanders)
- 二环 (Second Ring Road)
- 春熙路 (Chunxi Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 成都人: described as kind and not discriminatory against outsiders.
- 外地人: described as discriminatory and exclusionary towards locals; also described as wealthy enough to buy houses and afford betrothal gifts.
- 二环: the author mentions ""我二环的"" (I am from the Second Ring Road), implying an identification with this area.
- 春熙路: going there is described as ""进城"" (entering the city), which suggests a vernacular spatial perception of city core and periphery.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The phrase ""我们去春熙路一般都说进城"" (""When we go to Chunxi Road, we usually say we are entering the city"") implies a vernacular spatial authority (RL1) where the city center is symbolically defined and the areas inside and outside have different identity connotations.

- The author identifies as from ""二环"" (Second Ring Road), which is a spatial indicator linked to local identity, again reflecting RL1.

- The discussion about ""你们屋头有几套房"" (how many houses your family owns) and ""外地的都很有钱，能够买得起房"" (outsiders are rich enough to buy houses) is about wealth and social status but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity. Instead, this is more a social critique or observation about outsiders' attitudes and wealth; no direct link to defining ""local person"" identity.

- The contrast between locals and outsiders is mainly about behavior and social attitudes, not about administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, or occupation.

Step 4: Output the results:

Output: RL3, RL6","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 老成都人 (Old Chengdu locals)
- 成都 (Chengdu city)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author complains that old Chengdu locals are being looked down upon.
- Mentions that most old Chengdu locals are from ordinary families.
- Questions why the ""包容度大"" (tolerance) in Chengdu is equated with ""not caring about others"".
- Mentions ""归属感不强不融入当地不是本地人的错"" (lack of strong belonging or integration is not the fault of non-locals).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes ""老成都人"" as a category, suggesting a notion of ""old locals"".
- ""老成都人"" implies a family rootedness or long-term settlement, i.e., being from older generations.
- The author contrasts locals and non-locals based on integration and belonging, implying identity is related to social embeddedness or family rootedness.
- The phrase ""老成都人"" (old Chengdu people) strongly aligns with RL3: Family Rootedness.
- The discussion about ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) and ""融入当地"" (integration) also suggests social embeddedness (RL6).
- However, the author does not mention administrative status or linguistic-cultural markers explicitly.
- The author critiques others' attitudes but does not propose spatial boundaries or administrative legitimacy.
- The emphasis on ""老成都人"" and belonging indicates RL3 and RL6.

- 锦江区
- 二环
- 攀成钢

Step 2: Match arguments:
The phrase ""必须焊死在脑门上"" is a strong figurative expression meaning ""must be firmly fixed in one's mind."" The author is emphasizing that the identity or concept of ""local person"" is strongly tied to the areas 锦江区, 二环, and 攀成钢. This implies that these areas are key to defining local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is emphasizing the importance of specific intra-city areas (锦江区, 二环, 攀成钢) as core local areas.
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author stresses the local cognitive map or the habitual perception of what counts as ""local"" based on these areas.

Step 4: Output the results

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 二环内市区 (inside the Second Ring Road area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author mentions that people with a ""弯脚杆"" accent (a local derogatory term) provoke by attacking the author's hometown (Chengdu).
- Criticisms targeted at Chengdu include ""the noodles taste the worst,"" ""the inner Second Ring Road urban area is shabby,"" ""accent sounds bad,"" and ""people are hypocritical.""
- The author states that genuine Chengdu people are the ones who face discrimination from outsiders daily.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""口音难听"" (accent sounds bad) as a reason for conflict implies that accent/dialect is a key factor in distinguishing locals from outsiders or in local identity recognition.
- The author defends the local people (成都人才) as being discriminated against by outsiders, implying a boundary between locals and non-locals based on cultural-linguistic markers.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, or other RL categories as standards for defining local identity.
- The criticism of the ""inner Second Ring Road"" being ""shabby"" is mentioned as an external insult, not as the author's own standard for defining locals.
- Therefore, the author implicitly uses RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) as a key standard for defining local identity.

Step 4: Output the results.

- 中心城区 (central urban area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that they would not consider themselves a Chengdu person if they are outside the Third Ring Road, unless explaining to outsiders.
- The author implies that ""local Chengdu people"" generally refer to those from the central urban area.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the intra-city spatial boundary (Third Ring Road vs. central urban area) as a criterion to define who counts as a local person.
- This corresponds to RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 2: The author mentions that people from inside the Second Ring Road generally do not go into the city, preferring to stay in their own more remote area.

Step 3: The author implies a spatial distinction based on local perceptions of city areas—specifically, the Second Ring Road as a boundary of local activity. This reflects an intra-city spatial categorization that is not about administrative boundaries but about habitual or cultural perception of local areas.

Step 4: This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

- 成都人: They are not exclusionary or discriminatory.
- 三环外: Called ""弯脚杆"" (a nickname related to accent), implying a linguistic/cultural difference.
- 老一辈: Passed down the habit of using this nickname.
- 年轻人: Less likely to use this nickname now.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explains that people outside the Third Ring Road are identified by a different accent (口音), which is a linguistic-cultural marker. This nickname is used humorously but reflects a recognition of difference based on language and culture.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or family roots.
- The focus is on dialect/accent as a criterion for distinguishing local identity.
- The mention of ""三环外"" as a spatial marker combined with accent is more about cultural perception, but the emphasis is on accent and linguistic-cultural recognition rather than spatial authority alone.

Step 2: The author reports that their local relatives and friends look down on outsiders and consider those living outside the Third Ring Road as ""not okay."" The relatives also say the boyfriend is ""农转非"" (converted from rural to non-rural status).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The distinction about ""三环外的都不行"" reflects a spatial boundary perception based on local cognitive maps, typical of RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""农转非"" (converted from rural to non-rural status) relates to administrative or hukou status, indicating RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author does not explicitly endorse or oppose these views but reports them as standards used by their local relatives and friends. The author identifies as a local (""我土著我倒是还好""), implicitly agreeing with some local identity logic.

Step 4: Output all applicable recognition logic categories that the author implicitly or explicitly endorses or agrees with as standards for defining ""local person"":

- The author states ""大邑不算"" (Dayi does not count), implying it is not considered part of the local area.
- ""土著是一二三环内"" (locals are those within the first, second, and third ring roads), defining locals by spatial boundaries within the ring roads.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses spatial boundaries (ring roads) as the criterion for defining who counts as a local.
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1), as the author draws on habitual or colloquial spatial categories rather than administrative divisions.

Step 4: Output the result.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to entities:
- The author mentions that previously the Dayi accent was very strong.
- Now it is better.
- Currently, outsiders in Chengdu discriminate against native locals (成都土著).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of accent (大邑口音) and its strength indicates the use of dialect or accent as a criterion to distinguish locals from outsiders.
- The statement about outsiders discriminating against locals also implies recognition of local identity based on linguistic-cultural features.

Step 4: Output the results:

- 大邑县: The author's grandfather's original hometown is 大邑县, but the family has all moved to 成都. No mention of returning or maintaining ties to 大邑县.  
- 成都: The grandfather's family has moved there; the father’s generation claims to be ""土生土长成都人"" (born and raised in Chengdu).  

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author notes that the father's generation identifies as native locals (""土生土长成都人""), emphasizing birthplace and upbringing as the basis for local identity. This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).  
- No mention of administrative hukou, dialect, spatial boundaries, property, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity criteria.

思想观念，口音，穿着品味,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific; general concepts mentioned are ""思想观念"" (ideology/thought), ""口音"" (accent), and ""穿着品味"" (dress taste).

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity: The author mentions ""口音"" (accent), which is a linguistic feature often used to distinguish locals from outsiders. ""思想观念"" (ideology/thought) and ""穿着品味"" (dress taste) are more about cultural or personal traits but do not clearly correspond to a standard for defining local person identity based on the provided RL categories unless they are tied to linguistic-cultural recognition.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- ""口音"" clearly corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

- ""思想观念"" and ""穿着品味"" might be loosely cultural markers, but since the RL framework focuses on dialect, accent, or cultural linguistic habits, and the author mentions ""思想观念"" (thoughts) and ""穿着品味"" (dress taste) as identity markers, these can be considered part of RL4 if the author uses them to define local identity.

Since ""思想观念"" and ""穿着品味"" are cultural traits, and the RL4 includes cultural linguistic habits and customs, they fall under RL4.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL4"
……如果北京上海土著来到成都也是外地人，是不是也歧视人家思想意识 口音 和穿着品味,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 北京 (Beijing), 上海 (Shanghai), 成都 (Chengdu).

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author says that even if people who are native to Beijing or Shanghai come to Chengdu, they are still considered outsiders (""外地人""). Then the author questions whether this classification discriminates against their ideology/thoughts (""思想意识""), accent (""口音""), and clothing taste (""穿着品味"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author mentions ""口音"" (accent) as a possible basis for discrimination or identity judgment. This implies that accent or dialect is a factor in defining who is local or outsider. The author seems to critique or question the legitimacy of this standard.
- The author also mentions ""思想意识"" (ideology/thought) and ""穿着品味"" (clothing taste), but these are mentioned in a rhetorical question about discrimination, not clearly endorsing them as standards.
- The key point is the mention of accent as a basis for local vs outsider identification.
- Since the author questions whether it is discriminatory to judge people by their accent, it implies that accent is indeed a recognized standard for defining ""local"" identity, even if the author is critical of it.

Step 4: Output the recognized logic categories:
The only clearly recognized logic category is RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), because the author discusses accent as a criterion.

Output: RL4"

Step 2: The author criticizes the use of ""ideological concepts,"" ""accent,"" and ""clothing taste"" as excuses or ""shields"" for defining who is a local. The author implies these are not valid standards for defining ""local person"" identity, especially in the 21st century. The author mocks the idea that only city people are progressive in thought or have refined taste, and also dismisses accent as a meaningful criterion.

Step 3: Since the author explicitly denies the validity of RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) and the standard of ideological or taste-based identity (which might relate to RL4 as well), and does not endorse any standard here, no RL categories apply.

Step 4: Output the result.

认识的成都本地朋友中，没有这种人。网上一刷，这成都的鄙视链比北京都严重。比京二环的好像要牛气多了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都 (Chengdu), 北京 (Beijing), 京二环 (Beijing Second Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author notes that among their known local friends in Chengdu, there is no such person (referring to some unspecified type).
- The author observes online that the ""鄙视链"" (contempt hierarchy) in Chengdu is more serious than in Beijing, especially compared to the area inside Beijing's Second Ring Road.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""鄙视链"" related to areas such as ""京二环"" implies a spatial-based hierarchy or evaluation of local identity or status.
- The author compares spatial identity hierarchies between Chengdu and Beijing, implicitly acknowledging that such intra-city spatial categorizations are used to define or judge local identity or social status.
- This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it involves habitual local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories used for social evaluation.

Step 4: Output the results.

Output: RL1"
成都二环内土著，问就是没优越感，我也没什么社交圈子，有几个朋友，大多不是本地人，也没觉得啥,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都二环内 (Inside Chengdu Second Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to the entity:
- The author identifies themselves as a local born inside the Chengdu Second Ring Road.
- The author states they have no sense of superiority and limited social circles.
- Mentions most friends are not local.
- No explicit or implicit claim that social embeddedness (social circle) is a standard for defining local identity.
- The main point is the spatial location ""成都二环内"" as a basis for local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses spatial location inside the Second Ring Road to define ""local.""
- This is a vernacular spatial boundary, not official administrative.
- No mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity criteria.
- The author denies superiority or social embeddedness as criteria.
- Thus, the core logic is RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.

小时候没有成都土著这个概念，这十年也不知道是谁定义了这个概念,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""成都土著"" (Chengdu locals)

Step 2: The author states that in their childhood, there was no concept of ""Chengdu locals,"" and in the last ten years, they don't know who defined this concept.

Step 3: The author is questioning the origin or legitimacy of the ""local person"" identity concept but does not explicitly endorse or use any standard to define who is a local. They express ignorance about who defined it and imply it is a constructed or recent concept.

Step 4: Since the author does not propose or implicitly agree with any recognition logic for defining ""local person,"" no RL category applies.

- 长顺街
- 周边的城乡结合部
- 农村
- 锦小时
- 军区后勤的家属
- 长顺上街

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author identifies as 土著 (local/native) from 长顺街.
- The author envies 周边的城乡结合部 because of dividends, demolition compensation, and land ownership.
- The author envies people from 农村 for being able to return home during the New Year and enjoy natural pollution-free environment.
- The author envies classmates from 军区后勤的家属 for having many privileges.
- The author does not feel that 土著 have much superiority but misses old neighbors around 长顺上街, 中街, and 长发街附近.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The references to ""dividends, demolition, land"" and ""natural pollution-free environment"" and ""privileges"" are about social and material benefits, but the author does not explicitly use these as standards to define who is a local person, rather expresses envy for benefits others have.
- The author calls themselves 土著 from 长顺街, implying a family rootedness or generational belonging to the area.
- The mention of ""从长顺街出来的"" and ""羡慕从农村来的"" suggests the author recognizes family origin or growth history as a factor in local identity.
- The nostalgia for old neighbors around certain streets reflects a vernacular spatial recognition of place-based identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, or occupational typification.
- The envy of benefits is descriptive and does not establish these as criteria for local identity.

Step 4: Output the RL categories the author endorses for defining ""local person"":
- RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority (long-term recognition of local streets/neighborhoods)
- RL3: Family Rootedness (the author identifies as 土著 from 长顺街, implying family roots)

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The author states their home is located in the urban-rural fringe area outside the Third Ring Road.
- They mention that there are various things around, but generally do not go into the city.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) and the urban-rural fringe area is a spatial classification based on local habitual understanding of the city spatial layout.
- The author implies a cognitive distinction between inside and outside the Third Ring Road, suggesting a boundary for the local urban area.
- This reflects Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1), as it references local perceptions of urban boundaries and area identity.
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards here.

Step 4: Output the result:

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author mentions that many ""old locals"" (老土著), especially middle-aged and elderly people living in old and dilapidated small apartments (""老破小""), are discriminatory.
- When it comes to ""outside the Third Ring Road,"" many locals use derogatory terms (""弯脚杆"").
- There are also friendly locals, but the discriminatory ones are many.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) as a spatial boundary with locals having a negative or positive attitude implies the author acknowledges a vernacular spatial classification of local identity.
- The author seems to accept that locals distinguish insiders vs. outsiders or different local identities based on spatial boundaries (inside vs. outside the Third Ring Road).
- The use of terms like ""老土著"" and ""三环外"" as identity markers shows RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author does not mention hukou or administrative boundaries, nor family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards here.
- The author discusses local people's attitudes based on spatial location and shared local identity perceptions.

好像！！？你说的有道理！！！不过成都土著没有拆迁户过的轻松就不明白这优越感哪里来的hhh,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 成都土著 (Chengdu locals)  
- 拆迁户 (people who have experienced demolition and relocation)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author contrasts ""成都土著"" with ""拆迁户"", implying that those without demolition experience cannot understand the sense of superiority. This suggests a standard based on social embeddedness or economic status related to property and housing changes.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The reference to ""拆迁户"" (demolition households) and the ""sense of superiority"" likely relates to property ownership, housing rights, or social embeddedness within the local community.  
- The author implies that the local identity or superiority feeling is tied to having been involved in demolition compensation, which is a form of economic and social embeddedness.  
- This aligns with RL6: Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status).

- Regarding 成都人, the author says ""不是被骂的人吗？"" (aren't they people who get scolded?), ""口音难听"" (accent sounds bad), ""全是槽点"" (all points of criticism).
- 陈冠希 is mentioned but in an unclear context; ""假打"" (fake fight) may refer to an event or metaphor but no clear recognition logic.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author criticizes the accent (""口音难听"") as a reason to judge or mock 成都人.
- This implies the author is recognizing accent/dialect as a standard to identify or evaluate local identity.
- No mention or implication of administrative status, family roots, social embeddedness, or spatial boundaries.
- No mention of occupational typification or livability.
- The author is implicitly endorsing or using linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as a basis for defining or evaluating ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: The author mentions that ""都是外地人歧视成都口音的嘛"" — ""All outsiders discriminate against the Chengdu accent."" This implies a recognition of the Chengdu dialect/accent as a marker of local identity, and the existence of discrimination by outsiders against this linguistic marker.

Step 3: The underlying recognition logic is RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), because the author highlights dialect/accent (成都口音) as a boundary marker for local identity and mentions discrimination based on it.

Output: RL4"

- ""外地同学同事"" (non-local classmates and colleagues)  
- ""本地人"" (local people)  
- ""拆迁户老嬢嬢"" (demolition household older women)  
- ""外地朋友"" (non-local friends)  
- ""同学"" (classmates)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author notes that from elementary school to working for nearly ten years, they have met very few local people and many non-local friends and colleagues. The author sees no superiority among ordinary people since all are workers.  
- Some demolition household older women have a sense of superiority, which annoys others. Non-local friends can choose not to interact with them.  
- Regarding marriage, the author mentions that most in their cohort marry locals, often introduced by classmates, but there are also those who marry non-locals. The author cautions against making overly certain statements about this.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author highlights the importance of social relationships and shared life experiences (school, work, marriage) to define local belonging. The emphasis on ""同学介绍"" (classmates introductions) for marriage and the mention of cohort age suggest that family growth history or social embeddedness is relevant.  
- The author contrasts locals and non-locals primarily by origin, but does not mention administrative divisions or dialect. The mention of demolition households having superiority implies a social hierarchy but does not directly define local identity by property or social embeddedness.  
- The author emphasizes personal social networks and shared history (school, marriage connections), which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness). However, RL6 is less explicit here as the author only notes superiority attitudes but does not link property or economic status to identity.  
- There is no mention of spatial boundaries (RL1), administrative legitimacy (RL2), dialect or cultural linguistic features (RL4), livability or environmental quality (RL5), or occupational typification (RL7).

- For 成都:
  The author mentions that as a child, they lived at home without paying rent, had meals and slept at home, and their living condition was better than colleagues who came to work in Chengdu from elsewhere.
  The author notes that people coming from other parts of Sichuan to work in Chengdu consider the author a local person and envy them.
  The author's child once said they have no ""old home,"" and the author replied ""just Chengdu,"" indicating that Chengdu is the family's ""old home.""
  The family has settled in Chengdu, bought a house, and thus the author feels no superiority or inferiority.

- For 四川其他地方:
  Mentioned only as places where people come from to work in Chengdu and consider the author a local person.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The author implies that being a ""local person"" is recognized by others from other places in Sichuan because the author is from Chengdu (implying ""old home"" or hometown).
- The author mentions family ""old home"" as Chengdu, indicating family rootedness or growth history.
- The family has bought a house and settled in Chengdu, but the author does not explicitly link owning property to local identity; rather, the emphasis is on the family having a home base.
- The contrast between local people and migrant workers is mentioned implicitly by comparing the author with colleagues who came to work in Chengdu.

Based on the above, the author endorses:
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): The ""old home"" or family base in Chengdu is used as a standard to define local identity.
- Possibly RL6 (Social Embeddedness): Since the family bought a house and settled, indicating social embeddedness; however, the author does not emphasize property ownership as a standard for local identity, more like a settled life.
- RL7 (Occupational Typification): The author contrasts themselves with colleagues who come to work in Chengdu from elsewhere, implying occupational status or migrant worker status is a factor.

But since the author does not explicitly endorse property ownership as a standard, RL6 is weak.

- The author mentions that they work in Chengdu but are from Dujiangyan (implied by ""都江堰的在成都上班"").
- The author is criticized by others for their accent (""口音好难听"").
- The author expresses indifference to others' opinions about their accent (""关你毛线事，我爱咋咋说"").
- This implies the author considers speaking with their own accent as part of their identity and rejects others' judgments.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of accent (""口音"") as a marker of identity and the author's defense of their own accent indicates a focus on linguistic-cultural criteria for defining local identity.
- The author implicitly agrees that accent or dialect is a relevant standard but refuses to be judged negatively by others based on it.
- Therefore, the author endorses RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

- Family gatherings during festivals, speaking the Chengdu dialect, shared cultural identity and tastes.
- Intimate knowledge of the city's changes, with memories and stories tied to every street in the area where they grew up.
- Long-term social connections (friends and classmates growing up together).
- The city and their ancestors' home is something they love and watch grow.

- The author states ""本人条件能看口音可查"" indicating that their identity or authenticity as a local can be verified by accent.
- The author implies that speaking the local dialect or having the local accent is a standard to judge local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- ""三代成都人"" implies family rootedness (RL3).
- ""土著"" and ""三代"" emphasize generational roots (RL3).
- ""能看口音可查"" clearly refers to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author points out that compared to Shanghai, people directly say that the speaker's spoken language (accent) is not understood, and question which county the speaker is from.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the fact that the accent or dialect is not understood and is used to question someone's local identity.
- This reflects linguistic-cultural recognition logic, using accent/dialect as a criterion to judge whether someone is a local person.

Step 3: The author implies a linguistic-cultural boundary: the Sichuan dialect accent is a criterion for distinguishing locals from non-locals, and this accent carries social recognition or stigma. The author implicitly agrees that dialect/accent is a recognition logic in defining local identity.

Step 4: Output all matched recognition logics: RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)

- The author identifies with Chengdu people but respects outsiders who come to Chengdu to settle and work well.
- The author’s husband is from outside Chengdu, and the author admires him.
- The author works in an internet circle mostly composed of outsiders.
- The author mentions owning two houses in South Gate and being a ""拆迁户"" (resettled household).
- The author expresses pride in personal virtues like diligence, wisdom, kindness, effort, and low profile.
- The author expresses a kind of superiority or pride based on personal qualities and economic success (high salary, property ownership).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The mention of 南门 (South Gate) and owning houses there shows some spatial reference, but the author does not use it as a standard to define ""local person."" It's more about personal economic achievement.
- RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): No mention of hukou or administrative status as defining local identity.
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): The author does not emphasize family generational roots or long-term family presence in Chengdu.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 成都: ""真正的成都人都是不上班的"" (True Chengdu locals do not work), ""土生土长的本地人都是享受生活的"" (natives enjoy life)
- 南门: ""南门那边都是外地来打工的"" (South Gate area is full of migrant workers)

- 华阳，龙泉: ""也能叫成都？只认五城区"" (only five urban districts count as Chengdu)
- 五城区: ""只认五城区"", ""除了五城区，都是郊区"" (only five urban districts recognized; other areas are suburbs)

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The author's statement ""只认五城区"" and ""除了五城区，都是郊区"" indicates a logic based on **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** — the author endorses a local cultural/habitual perception that only the five urban districts count as ""real"" Chengdu.
- The emphasis on ""真正的成都人"" and ""土生土长的本地人"" points to **Family Rootedness (RL3)** — the author values native birth and growth in the area as criteria.
- The distinction between locals and ""外地来打工的"" (migrant workers) and ""农民拆迁的"" (relocated farmers) reflects an occupational or social class typification related to place identity, indicating **Occupational Typification (RL7)**.
- The negative evaluation of ""整体素质不高"" for Tianfu New Area residents is linked to social embeddedness or social stratification, but since it is about quality and group type, this fits RL7.
- The ""不上班"" and ""享受生活"" statements relate to lifestyle, but since they are used to characterize ""真正的成都人"" (true locals), and the author uses these to define local identity, this aligns with **Family Rootedness (RL3)** or possibly social embeddedness. However, since the author links it to native birth/growth, RL3 is more fitting.
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, linguistic-cultural recognition, or functional livability.

我来回答你吧，这个主要是看经济条件和双方家庭。比如本地土著，父母n套房，退休工资贼高的那种，自然是不可能愿意找县城里面务农，父母没得退休金的家庭。这个跟是不是成都土著没关系，放眼全国任何一个城市都是这样，毕竟婚姻需要门当户对。那么如果土著家庭条件一般，对方县城家里条件也差不多，且双方父母都有合适的退休金那也没得问题。总之就是对方其实是挑需不需要娃娃负担养老而不是挑地域。你试试县城有钱的他们还挑不挑？这个属于经济问题，跟地域没得太大的关系。,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- ""本地土著"" (local natives)  
- ""县城"" (county town)  
- ""成都土著"" (Chengdu natives)  
- ""全国任何一个城市"" (any city nationwide)  

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author argues that being a ""local person"" (土著) is not primarily defined by regional origin (e.g., whether one is a Chengdu native or not).  
- Instead, the key criteria are economic conditions and family background, such as parents owning multiple houses, having high retirement wages, and economic compatibility in marriage.  
- The author emphasizes marriage matching based on economic and family conditions rather than geographic origin.  
- The author explicitly states that economic factors matter more than regional origin in defining local identity.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author focuses on economic conditions and family wealth/status as criteria for local identity, not on administrative, linguistic, or cultural factors.  
- This aligns most closely with RL6: Social Embeddedness, because it involves economic status, family assets (multiple houses, retirement wages), and social integration (marriage matching).  
- There is no explicit or implicit indication that the author uses spatial authority (RL1), administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), functional livability (RL5), or occupational typification (RL7) as standards for defining local identity.  
- The author explicitly denies that regional origin (geography) is a main criterion, so RL1 and RL2 are not endorsed.  

Step 4: Output the result

成都人均收入并不高，一个城市全部翻新之后，就把低收入人群赶出去了，没有低收入人群服务，生活成本就上去了，成都的老小区生活便利，低收入人群也住的舒服，包容性很强。,Output:,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都 (Chengdu), 成都的老小区 (Chengdu's old residential areas)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author mentions that after a city is completely renovated, low-income people are pushed out.
- Without low-income people, service availability decreases, and living costs rise.
- The old residential areas in Chengdu are convenient to live in.
- Low-income people live comfortably in these old areas.
- These old areas have strong inclusiveness.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses the presence and inclusion of low-income people as part of what makes a local area ""good"" or ""inclusive.""
- The focus is on the social composition and inclusiveness of the area.
- However, the author does not explicitly say that low income or social class is a standard to define who is a local person.
- The mention of living convenience and services relates to livability, but the author does not explicitly say these are criteria for ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not mention administrative status, family roots, dialect, or occupational typification as criteria.
- The emphasis is on the social embeddedness and inclusiveness of the area for low-income groups.

Does the author use the presence of low-income people and inclusiveness as a standard to define ""local person""? The text says ""包容性很强"" (strong inclusiveness), and the low-income people live comfortably, implying that this inclusiveness is a valued attribute of the local area, but it is more about the area's social environment rather than defining who is local.

Given the task requirement: If the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define ""local person"" identity, do not annotate.

The text focuses on livability and social inclusiveness of old neighborhoods, not on defining who is a local person.

Step 4: Output results

Output:"

Output:","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 一二环 (First and Second Ring Road area)
- 老小区 (old residential communities)
- 00年 (the year 2000)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author mentions prices below 10,000 RMB per square meter in the first and second ring road old residential areas from around the year 2000.
- The mention seems to be about price and location.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is mentioning price and spatial location (first and second ring roads, old communities).
- However, the text does not explicitly or implicitly say that these price or location features are standards to define who is a ""local person.""
- The mention of ""一二环"" might relate to RL1 (vernacular spatial authority) if the author is implying that these areas are core local areas.
- But here, the author only states price and location, without explicitly or implicitly linking it to ""local person"" identity.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or functional livability as a criterion for local identity.
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly say that the price or old residential area defines local person identity.

Step 4: Output results:
- Since the text only mentions price and location without linking to local identity standards, no RL category applies.

- 二环 (Second Ring Road)
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 郊区 (suburbs)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 二环 and 一二环内 (within first and second ring roads): The author mentions that their parents have worked in Chengdu for a long time and mostly live within the first or second ring roads. They also mention buying a house in the suburbs is unrealistic, and renovating a house within the first or second ring is the best plan.
- 郊区: Buying a house in the suburbs is described as unrealistic.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses the location within the ring roads (specifically the first and second ring roads) as an important factor tied to their parents’ long-term work and social life there (friends nearby). This suggests a standard of local rootedness related to family and social embeddedness.
- The mention of buying a house within a better environment and within the ring roads implies the importance of property ownership and embeddedness in local society.
- The emphasis on parents working in Chengdu for a long time and having friends nearby suggests RL3 (Family Rootedness) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The mention of ring roads and location also suggests some spatial authority logic, RL1, because the author distinguishes areas inside the ring roads as meaningful local areas.
- The discussion about the cost of buying a house and environmental quality touches on RL5 (Functional Livability) because the author is concerned about the environment quality and location convenience.
- However, the core is about the identity and social embeddedness related to living and working within these spatial boundaries.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The area is close to the Second Ring Road.
- The area has various noises and high density.
- The price is very expensive.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author comments on noise and density (living environment), and price (economic aspect).
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that these factors are used as standards to define who is a ""local person"" or to evaluate the identity of a ""local person"".
- The text is mainly describing living conditions and price, without linking them to local identity definition.
- Therefore, no recognition logic applies.

- 楼梯房 (staircase apartments)  
- 大平层 (large flat units)  
- 联排别墅 (townhouses)  
- 独栋别墅 (detached villas)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:  
- 楼梯房 is considered safer, e.g., in fire or elevator accidents.  
- 大平层 is labeled as a ""pseudo-improvement"" or ""pseudo-luxury.""  
- The author only recognizes 联排别墅 or 独栋别墅 as real desirable housing (""有天有地"").  
- The author asserts ""啥都是自己说了算,"" implying self-determination or personal standards.  
- 三环内 has houses costing 6-7 million yuan, mentioned in a context that suggests a distinction in housing types.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author’s core argument is about what kind of housing counts as real or desirable local living conditions. The mention of safety and type of housing as defining features implies a standard of livability or functional quality.  
- The emphasis on housing type and safety relates to the functional livability of an area (RL5).  
- The mention of ""三环内"" (inside the Third Ring Road) indicates a spatial boundary, but the author does not explicitly say that this boundary defines ""local person"" identity, only discusses housing prices there. No clear RL1 logic about defining ""local"" identity by spatial boundaries is expressed.  
- No administrative legitimacy (RL2) is mentioned.  
- No family rootedness (RL3) or linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) or social embeddedness (RL6) or occupational typification (RL7) are expressed or implied.  
- The statement ""啥都是自己说了算"" suggests a personal standard but does not specify a recognized local identity logic.

Step 4: Output the results:  
The only recognition logic clearly used by the author to define or evaluate local identity (in terms of local housing and living environment) is RL5 Functional Livability.

- 哈尔滨辖区内 (Harbin jurisdiction area)
- 市里 (urban area)
- 县里 (county area)
- 道里 (Daoli district)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author originally believes anyone within Harbin's jurisdiction, whether city or county, counts as a Harbin person.
- But they encountered on Xiaohongshu that county residents are considered rural and not Harbin people; only those from Daoli are ""old Harbin people.""

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author accepts the administrative boundary (Harbin jurisdiction area including city and county) as a standard to define who counts as Harbin people, which corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The mention that only people from Daoli district are ""old Harbin people"" implies a vernacular spatial authority standard about which areas ""count"" as core local areas, i.e., Daoli as a cultural or symbolic core area. This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

The author initially uses RL2 but contrasts with others' RL1-based views.

Step 4: Output all recognized RL categories the author endorses or implicitly accepts.

- 说自己是主城区土生土长的，作者认为挺搞笑（implying that claiming ""main urban area native"" status is questionable).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author accepts the administrative jurisdiction (""属于哈市辖区范围内"") as a basis for defining local identity — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author denies or ridicules claims of being ""main urban area born and raised"" (family rootedness or spatial authority) — but since this is resistance, no RL3 or RL1 is annotated.

- The author notes that administratively, 9 districts and 12 counties (including 双城) belong to Harbin.
- The author comments on disputes on Douyin about identity distinctions based on accent.
- The author explicitly states no pride or shame in being from either 双城 or Harbin.
- The author reflects on city development being a collective effort of all people living and working there, regardless of being old or new Harbin people.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author acknowledges administrative boundaries (""9区12县的都可以说自己是哈尔滨的""), which corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- However, the author prefers to identify as 双城人, suggesting a distinction from Harbin people based on a local spatial identity, which relates to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of accent-based disputes indicates awareness of linguistic-cultural distinctions, but the author does not endorse this as a defining standard for local identity, so RL4 is not supported.
- The author rejects the idea that being from Harbin elevates social status (""没有觉得说是哈尔滨人能为我提升什么档次""), so no RL6 or RL5.

- 呼兰 and 阿城 are referred to as ""双城"" (two cities), not the same place; travel time to 呼兰 from childhood was about one hour by train.
- 姥姥家 belongs administratively to 黑河, but people do not consider it part of 黑河; everyone calls each place by its own name; the author does not consider having been to 黑河.
- Only the city proper (市区) counts as the city.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes local identity based on habitual, shared perceptions of spatial boundaries and distinctions beyond official administrative divisions (e.g., 宾县 is administratively related but not considered part of 哈尔滨 in local perception).
- The emphasis on ""only city proper counts as this city"" and the distinction between city and surrounding counties reflects vernacular spatial authority, i.e., RL1.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
The author says:  
- ""老哈尔滨人都认为早期的七区（还有被取消的动力区和太平区）五县，现在是哈尔滨市区主要包括..."" This reflects the perception of ""old Harbin people"" about what constitutes the core urban area of Harbin.  
- ""其他算郊县"" (Others are considered suburban counties).  
- ""啥哈尔滨人……唉，都是中国人，行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人。没必要"" — the author seems to dismiss strict distinctions based on administrative divisions or local emotional boundaries, emphasizing that within the administrative area, everyone is a Harbin person.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The first part shows the author referencing the traditional local perception of the core urban area (the seven districts + two canceled districts + five counties) as the main ""Harbin city"" area, which is a shared habitual local perception, not strictly administrative, indicating RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The mention of administrative boundaries (""行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人"") suggests the author recognizes the administrative legitimacy logic as well (RL2), though the author seems to minimize its importance (""没必要""). However, since the author states ""within administrative area, all are Harbin people,"" they implicitly accept RL2 as a standard for defining local identity.

- The author criticizes the viewpoint held by some ""old Harbin locals"" who exclude these areas from Harbin.
- The author challenges the logic behind these exclusions, asking where these excluded areas belong if not to Harbin (Daqing or Qiqihar?).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author discusses which districts and counties count as part of the city of Harbin, questioning the spatial boundaries and the legitimacy of excluding certain areas.
- This discussion revolves around the scope of the urban area and what spatial areas are recognized as ""local"" parts of Harbin.
- The author critiques the collective perception or social consensus held by some locals who exclude these areas.
- The argument focuses on spatial inclusion/exclusion and the legitimacy of boundaries defining local identity.
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it deals with local perceptions of spatial boundaries and which areas count as part of the local city identity.
- The author also mentions administrative divisions indirectly by questioning which city the excluded areas belong to (Harbin, Daqing, or Qiqihar), but the main focus is on contesting the local spatial identity logic rather than affirming administrative legitimacy.
- The author does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy as the standard but questions the exclusion logic.

- Wetland farmers' children (湿地农家的孩子)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- Harbin city: The author criticizes using ""accent/dialect and habits"" as identity criteria, mocking those who use municipal welfare policies as regional dividing lines. The author rejects the logic of using administrative boundaries (like ticket rules) as criteria for social status.
- Red sausage: The author sarcastically questions if only county-produced red sausages can be called Harbin red sausage, challenging administrative legitimacy as a boundary.
- Ice and snow world ticket rules: Described as administrative division products, not legitimate markers of social worth.
- Daqing and its five districts and four counties: The author claims they all belong to one city, and children from different backgrounds grow up together, emphasizing a shared identity that transcends administrative or dialect differences.
- The author explicitly rejects judging locals by hukou (户口本) or administrative divisions.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author rejects RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) — the use of accent and dialect as identity markers.
- The author rejects RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) — hukou, ticket rules, and administrative divisions are not legitimate to judge local identity.
- The author endorses a view that ""five districts and four counties belong to one city,"" implying shared spatial belonging beyond administrative divisions, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author emphasizes shared social roots and growth together (""油田子弟和湿地农家的孩子都在磕头机旁长大""), which is about family and growth history, consistent with RL3 (Family Rootedness).

- 哈尔滨 (Harbin)  
- 市里 (city center)  
- 周边县城 (surrounding counties)  
- 北上广 (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 哈尔滨: The author questions the division within Harbin about who is a ""正宗的哈尔滨人"" (authentic Harbin local).  
- 市里的房价 vs. 周边县城: The author compares housing prices between the city center and surrounding counties, noting no significant difference.  
- 北上广: The author references the large wealth gap in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as a benchmark for when such divisions might be justified.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic  
- The author is challenging the legitimacy of dividing locals based on wealth or housing price differences. They mention housing prices but do not endorse housing price or wealth as a criterion for defining a local person. Instead, they seem to reject such criteria unless the wealth gap is very large (like in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou).  
- The question of ""正不正宗的哈尔滨人"" (authentic Harbin local) hints at identity disputes but the author does not specify any explicit criteria such as administrative status, family roots, dialect, or social embeddedness.  
- The mention of housing price differences is used to argue against making distinctions based on wealth or economic status.  
- Therefore, the author implicitly rejects RL5 (Functional Livability) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness) as identity criteria.  
- The author does not provide any other criteria, nor do they explicitly endorse any of the RL categories.  
- The text is mainly about rejecting divisions based on wealth differences and questioning the legitimacy of such divisions within Harbin.

Step 4: Output the results  
Since the author neither explicitly nor implicitly endorses any recognition logic to define ""local person,"" and only rejects wealth-based divisions, **no RL categories apply**.

This is a spatial/historical classification of urban areas, reflecting collective historical and cultural perceptions of which areas are the true city center.  
- The distinction between 老道外 as the local people's city center and 博物馆转盘道 as the official/functional city center reflects a cognitive spatial division, emphasizing historical and cultural sedimentation of place identity rather than administrative borders.

以前是啊，后来城市发展都往周边建，老城区拆迁拆不起。就是最早繁华的有可能城市发展过快变成城中村。但是哈尔滨不至于，现在就是哈西和群力火一点，江北那边可能受影响较大没火起来。最早火实际是哈西，那时候群力没什么人。一般都首选哈西，群力买房人少。后来群力发展起来了，感觉比哈西还更繁华一些。住城市中心的好处，可能现在不明显了，以前没那么多公交线路，没地铁，打车又贵，更买不起车的年代，在中心住去哪都方便快捷。现在不一样了，实际去哪不堵车都差不多。我在北京一侧五环住，另一侧三环上班。公交倒地铁三趟再倒公交再走，两个半小时。你想想一天五个小时在路上，那耽误多少时间。北京交通那是啥也干不了，想看书？歌都听不了,"RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:

- Qun Li (群力)
- Jiang Bei (江北)
- Beijing (北京)
- Fifth Ring Road (五环)
- Third Ring Road (三环)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- Harbin: city development shifted to surrounding areas; old city center became less affordable; Ha Xi and Qun Li are hot areas; Jiang Bei less developed.
- Ha Xi: originally the most popular area to live; preferred for housing.
- Qun Li: initially less populated, later developed to become even more prosperous than Ha Xi.
- Beijing: author lives near Fifth Ring Road, works near Third Ring Road; commuting time is long and inconvenient despite transportation options; previously living in city center was convenient due to limited transport.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses urban spatial development, the changing attractiveness of city areas, and the convenience of living in city center versus suburbs.
- The discussion about which areas are considered more ""hot"" or ""prosperous"" and the historical development of these areas reflects a shared perception of urban spatial hierarchy and the symbolic meaning of city zones.
- The mention of commuting difficulties and transport infrastructure affecting livability reflects functional livability considerations.
- The author contrasts old and new transport conditions, emphasizing convenience and time cost in living location choice.

Step 4: Output the results:
- The author uses **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** by discussing which urban areas are considered hot, prosperous, or less developed, reflecting local cognitive maps of spatial hierarchy.
- The author uses **RL5 (Functional Livability)** by discussing transportation convenience, commuting time, and accessibility as important factors in evaluating urban living quality.

- 合肥 (Hefei)

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The author states that Hefei is an immigrant city.
- The author arrived in Hefei in 1993, went to school from kindergarten to high school.
- The so-called ""pure"" Hefei locals are few; most came with parents in the 1990s.
- Communication is mainly in Mandarin; local Hefei dialect is not spoken.
- The author's local colleagues likely also immigrated in childhood.
- The author and others are seen as locals by outsiders because they arrived in kindergarten, but they are not ""native born and raised"" (not 土生土长).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- No mention of area boundaries or identity definitions.
- No mention of property ownership or social embeddedness.
- No mention of occupation types.

Step 4: Output the results:

- After 2014, the author increasingly dislikes staying in Hefei, tries to escape every year for a holiday, feels other cities are fresher, and complains about complicated traffic and risks of collisions with electric bikes.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author self-identifies as a ""土生土长合肥人,"" which indicates RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The author expresses a feeling of discomfort due to traffic environment and infrastructure, but this is a personal evaluation of livability, not explicitly used as a standard to define who is a local person. The complaint about traffic is about livability but the author does not say it defines local identity.
- The core identity standard the author uses is ""土生土长"" (born and raised), i.e., RL3.

Output: RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 合肥

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 合肥:
- The author identifies as a ""合肥土著人"" (local person of Hefei).
- Mentions that Hefei's ""名片"" (symbol or identity card) has changed from ""包拯故里"" (home of Bao Zheng) to ""大湖名城"" (big lake famous city), implying a change or expansion in the city's identity.
- Notes that the city's area has expanded, transportation is becoming more convenient.
- Expresses hope that related livelihood policies will catch up to these changes.
- Wishes for Hefei to become truly livable.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author identifies as a local person of Hefei, but the basis for this identity is not explicitly tied to family roots, dialect, or occupation.
- The mention of the city ""名片"" changing from one symbolic identity (Bao Zheng's hometown) to another (Big Lake Famous City) reflects an understanding of the city's identity in terms of symbolic and cultural meaning attached to spatial areas, which is consistent with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author mentions the expansion of the city area and improvement of transportation, and hopes for better livability, which reflects RL5 (Functional Livability) since livability and convenience are considered standards for evaluating the city.
- No mention of administrative boundaries or hukou (RL2).
- No mention of family roots or growth history (RL3).

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 合肥: The author mentions population gathering and management issues, parking problems, and that there are many locals (""本地人也不少的""). The author also says that locals have less benefit from rising housing prices compared to outsiders who form ""new Hefei people,"" and locals have relatively less competitiveness.
- 深圳: Used as a contrast point, saying locals in Shenzhen benefit more from asset increases due to rising housing prices.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes between ""locals"" and ""outsiders"" (""本地人"" vs ""外地人"") and refers to ""new Hefei people"" formed by outsiders. The author also emphasizes asset increase from housing price rise and competitiveness as a factor related to local identity.
- However, the author does not explicitly say that rising housing prices or asset increases define who is a local. The mention is more about social competition or advantage, not a standard for local identity.
- The author does mention ""本地人"" (locals) but does not specify the basis for defining locals (e.g., hukou, family roots, dialect).
- The mention of ""本地人"" is in contrast with ""外地人"" and ""new Hefei people,"" suggesting a social embeddedness or economic status difference.
- The core argument is that locals have less benefit from rising housing prices, implying that asset ownership or economic gains relate to ""new local"" identity or competitiveness.
- This suggests some link to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as the author relates local identity or competitiveness to property assets and economic integration.
- No mention or endorsement of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, vernacular spatial authority, or occupational typification.
- The discussion of ""management"" and ""parking"" is about city management, not about local identity standards.
- Therefore, only RL6 is relevant as the author implicitly connects property assets and economic competitiveness to local identity.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic: The author discusses house prices (房价) in 大圩 and 葡萄家园, which relates to economic status or property value. However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly state that house prices or property ownership are standards used to define whether someone is a ""local person."" The comment is about the housing market, not about local identity.

- Regarding ""朋友大铺头"": mentions demolition and housing not yet received, small monthly subsidy.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author talks about housing size, money spent, subsidies, and housing prices, but does not explicitly or implicitly say these are standards for defining who is a ""local person"".
- The discussion is about property and financial aspects but does not connect these to local identity.
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness in terms of community or local relationships, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.

Step 2: The author notes that ""合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区"" - that is, people in Hefei tend to call the High-tech Zone (高新区) an administrative district, implying a recognition or labeling of spatial areas beyond strict administrative boundaries.  
Step 3: The underlying recognition logic is about how locals perceive and categorize city areas, not strictly by official administrative divisions but by habitual or collective local understanding. This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
Step 4: Output the matched recognition logic.

- 高新区 has its own school district (学区), its own administrative committee (管委会) managing administrative affairs, residents do not go to 蜀山区 for matters, property certificates belong to 高新区, only the ID card is from 蜀山区.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses administrative and institutional factors (school district, administrative committee, property certificate) to define the local identity of 高新区 residents.
- The mention of property certificates and administrative management implies official jurisdiction and legal status.
- The ID card being from 蜀山区 is mentioned as a mismatch, implying that the author considers administrative legitimacy (管委会管理, 房产证归属) as more important than the ID card's administrative division.

Therefore, the author endorses Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

- 庐阳: Also described as very livable.
- 包河 and 蜀山: Described as having better development.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses convenience of living functions (buying things easily), and development level as criteria to evaluate these districts. This relates to the material and functional livability standard.
- The author does not mention family roots, administrative legitimacy, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The author also does not explicitly link these evaluations to defining who is a local person, but the task states to annotate if the author endorses these standards to evaluate ""local area"" quality or scope.

- 维信诺 (Visionox)
- 康宁 (Corning)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 新站: The author lives there for a few years, life is quite convenient with metro lines 1, 3, and 4. Advantage: it is a city area with property ownership certificates (市区产证). Overall environment is average. Many areas are designated industrial zones. The area is mainly supported by large factories (BOE, Visionox, Corning). The later five-star hotels do not relate much to ordinary people.
- 磨店: Commercial street with some snacks and milk tea shops, not many people.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes ""市区产证"" (city area property certificates) as an advantage. This refers to administrative legitimacy (RL2), since property certificates and city district designation relate to official administrative status.
- The convenience of metro lines and living environment is described but not explicitly linked to defining ""local person"" identity or local area recognition logic. The author does not explicitly say that living convenience or environment defines who is local.
- The industrial zone designation is mentioned, but as a description, not as a standard to define local person identity.
- The presence of big factories supporting the area is described as an economic fact, but no indication the author uses this as a standard for local identity.
- The mention of five-star hotels being unrelated to ordinary people is a social observation, not a recognition logic.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as a standard to define ""local person.""
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority (like emotional or cultural local boundary definitions).

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says ""政务区只是从经济上划分的独立区域，行政上依然是属于蜀山区"" (""Zhengwu District is only an economically defined independent area, administratively it still belongs to Shushan District"").
- The author compares Shenzhen's relation to the country: Shenzhen is an economic special zone but also part of the country, but cannot represent the country.
- The author notes that most local Hefei people say ""蜀山区天鹅湖"" (Shushan District Swan Lake) when referring to Swan Lake.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes administrative boundaries (""行政上依然是属于蜀山区""), implying that the administrative division is the legitimate basis for defining local spatial identity.
- The mention that locals refer to Swan Lake as part of Shushan District also supports the administrative legitimacy perspective.
- The comparison with Shenzhen and the country further clarifies that economic zones do not redefine administrative identity.

Therefore, the author endorses Administrative Legitimacy (RL2) as the standard for defining local spatial identity.

- 高新区: Best development from industrial employment perspective; reachable by ordinary people through personal effort.
- 政务区: Best development from personal experience; relatively new, mature facilities, good living experience.
- 护城河内的老居民 (old residents inside the moat): The development in the outskirts is not closely related to them; they have top education, medical facilities, core commercial areas; emphasize comfort and convenience, community warmth, and social embeddedness (neighbors helping each other).
- Province hospital (省立安医): Easy access, no long travel time.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates different districts by various criteria but focuses especially on the ""personal experience"" and ""functional living experience"" aspects (comfort, convenience, proximity to schools and hospitals, neighborhood social interactions).
- The description of ""单位大院邻里的热火劲"" (lively neighborhood in the work unit compound), ""远亲不如近邻的熟人圈"" (neighbors better than distant relatives) indicates social embeddedness and community social roots.
- The emphasis on ""舒服便捷第一位"" (comfort and convenience first) and proximity to top education, medical, and commercial resources aligns with functional livability.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy or family rootedness, dialect, or occupational typification as defining local identity.
- The author implicitly recognizes the importance of community social ties and functional living quality as defining features of what makes a ""local"" place or identity.

- The author expresses intention to buy a second house in 橡树湾 or nearby.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author evaluates the area based on livability factors such as transportation, amenities, environment, property management, and schools.
- These factors correspond to functional livability standards.
- There is no explicit or implicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.

发展这块，就产业而言，综合下来高新是大哥。就环境而言，滨湖是最舒服的。就烟火气而言个人感官庐阳最有感觉。如果按行政区域来算，蜀山区无疑，老城新区产业环境都有的。,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 高新 (High-tech zone)
- 滨湖 (Binhu)
- 庐阳 (Luyang)
- 蜀山区 (Shushan District)
- 老城新区 (Old city new district)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 高新 is described as ""大哥"" in terms of industry (产业).
- 滨湖 is described as ""最舒服"" in terms of environment (环境).
- 庐阳 is described as having the most ""烟火气"" (sense of everyday life or local atmosphere).
- 蜀山区 is identified as the administrative area with both industry and environment.
- 老城新区 also has industry and environment.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly mentions ""如果按行政区域来算"" (if calculated by administrative region), implying that administrative divisions are a standard to judge or define local areas. This corresponds to RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.
- The author also evaluates areas based on ""产业"" (industry), ""环境"" (environment), and ""烟火气"" (local atmosphere or liveliness). These are evaluations of area characteristics, not necessarily defining ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of ""烟火气"" as a personal feeling of ""local atmosphere"" could imply a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1), as it refers to a sensory and emotional local perception.
- However, the author does not explicitly link these characteristics as standards for defining who is a ""local person."" The text focuses more on area evaluation.
- The only explicit standard for defining ""local"" or judging areas is the administrative division (""如果按行政区域来算"").
- The mention of ""烟火气"" is a subjective feeling but may imply vernacular spatial perception of an area’s identity.

Step 4: Output
- The author uses RL2 explicitly.
- RL1 is implied by the mention of ""烟火气"" as a local atmosphere, but the author does not explicitly use this to define ""local person"" identity.
- The task requires the author to endorse or implicitly agree with the standard to define ""local person"" identity. Here, the author only says ""if calculated by administrative region,"" which suggests using administrative legitimacy as a standard.
- The mention of ""烟火气"" is about the area feeling, not about judging people’s local identity.
- So RL2 is definitely included.
- RL1 is questionable but can be included since ""烟火气"" is a vernacular perception of local identity (although it is about area feeling, not person identity). The task focuses on ""local person"" identity definition, so if the author uses ""烟火气"" to define an area's local identity, it is relevant.
- But the text says ""个人感官庐阳最有感觉"" (personal feeling Luyang has the most), which is a personal sensory impression, not a general accepted standard for defining ""local person"".
- Therefore, RL1 is not sufficiently supported.

- For 庐阳, the author evaluates the area as ""比较适合生活"" citing school district, hospital, and convenient geographic location. This is a direct evaluation of livability and functional convenience → RL5 Functional Livability.
- The mention of ""消费最高"" (highest consumption) is an observation of economic activity but does not explicitly tie to local identity definition → no annotation.
- ""老城区"" (old urban area) is mentioned but only as a description, not as a standard of local identity → no RL1.
- For 蜀山、经开、包河, the author compares them but only mentions general feelings and the rising trend of 包河. No explicit or implicit link to defining local identity or local person → no annotation.
- 瑶海's environment and development are evaluated negatively, but no link to local identity → no annotation.
- 滨湖、新站 no comment on identity → no annotation.

- 龙岗, especially near 长江批发市场: The author describes chaotic traffic conditions and dangerous behavior by electric cargo bikes.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author excludes 瑶海 and complains about the disorder near 龙岗’s 长江批发市场, but the focus is on traffic disorder and safety, not on defining who is a ""local person"" or evaluating local identity standards.  
- There is no indication that the author uses administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational types, or livability factors as criteria for defining local identity.  
- The mention ""瑶海排除"" might imply a spatial boundary, but the author does not explicitly say that this is a standard for defining ""local person"" identity, only that this area is excluded from some consideration (likely livability or safety).

- 五里庙 (Wulimia)
- 朗溪路高架 (Langxi Road elevated road)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 双地铁4.6: The author says ""也是很方便"" (""also very convenient"").
- 新房二手一起疯狂卷: refers to intense competition in new and second-hand housing, related to the area with subway lines 4 and 6.
- 五里庙和朗溪路高架: described as ""不利因素"" (""disadvantageous factors""), ""美中不足"" (""a flaw in an otherwise good situation"").

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author focuses on convenience (""很方便""), subway access, and housing market competition.
- These points relate to livability and functional convenience of the area.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly use these factors to define who is a local person, but rather evaluates the convenience and quality of living in the area.
- According to the task instruction, only if the author uses these standards to define ""local person"" identity or the ""local area"" as a concept of localness, do we annotate.
- The author only evaluates convenience and disadvantages of the area, not local identity per se.
- Therefore, RL5 might be considered if the author evaluates the area as ""local"" or ""not local"" based on convenience.
- The text says ""也是很方便"" (also very convenient), and ""美中不足"" (a small flaw), indicating an evaluation of the area's livability.
- However, the author does not explicitly say this is a standard to define ""local person"" identity.
- The instruction says: ""If the author considers an area an ideal 'local' living space due to its RL5 characteristics, or believes an area does not meet the standard of a 'good local' area due to lack of RL5 characteristics,"" annotate RL5.
- The text does suggest convenience and disadvantage affect the quality of the local area.
- So the author uses RL5 standards to evaluate the local area.

肥东必须是最差，工业园不说了，空气环境不行，交通也不行，设施也跟不上 ， 下雨就涝，地震中心,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 肥东, 工业园

Step 2: The author evaluates 肥东 as ""最差"" (the worst), citing reasons like poor air environment, poor traffic, inadequate facilities, flooding when raining, and being in the earthquake center. However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly say that these factors define whether someone is a ""local person"" or the local identity. The author is describing the quality of living environment and infrastructure.

Step 3: The author mentions environmental and functional conditions (air quality, traffic, facilities), which relate to Recognition Logic 5 (Functional Livability). But the key is whether the author uses these as standards to define ""local person"" identity or ""local"" area scope. The author calls 肥东 ""最差"" but does not explicitly or implicitly connect these factors to defining local identity.

No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority related to defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Since the author only discusses livability but does not use these as identity definition standards, no RL labels apply.

- No specific named entities mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The text states ""交通确实很方便的"" (""The transportation is indeed very convenient"").

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author mentions convenience of transportation, which relates to functional livability aspects of an area.  
- However, the text only states convenience without explicitly linking it to defining who is a ""local person"" or evaluating the ""local"" identity boundary or scope.  
- The statement does not indicate that the author uses transportation convenience as a standard to judge ""local person"" identity. It is simply an evaluation of a feature of the area.

Step 4: Output the results  
- Since the statement does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that transportation convenience is used as a recognition logic for ""local person"" identity, no RL categories apply.

- 市区 (urban area / city center)
- 济南 (Jinan)
- 济钢桥头374车站 (Jigang Bridgehead 374 Bus Station)
- 韩仓站 (Hancang Station)
- CBD (Central Business District, original Ergang)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author recalls that going from Jigang to the city center was called ""going to Jinan,"" and they needed to take a train to ""Jinan,"" indicating a perception that Jigang is distinct from the city center.
- The 374 bus station name reflected distance from Qingdao station (374 km), later renamed Hancang Station and now abandoned.
- Over time, bus lines (8, 10) and later bus and metro services became available.
- However, within the CBD (original Ergang), electric carts are still the most convenient.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies a spatial and cognitive boundary between Jigang and the city center (""going to Jinan"" means going to the city center), reflecting a habitual local perception of intra-city spatial categories.
- The mention of historical naming of bus stations based on distance and the shift in transport modes reflects changes in local spatial recognition.
- The description of convenience and transport modes inside and outside certain areas (CBD, Ergang) suggests an evaluation of areas' livability or functionality, but the author does not explicitly link this to defining who is a ""local person,"" only describing transport convenience.
- The core identity-related logic is about spatial boundaries and local perception of areas rather than administrative boundaries or family roots.
- No explicit mention of hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

- 市里 (city center)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author recalls childhood spatial perceptions of Jinan city boundaries: westernmost is Hexie, easternmost is Dianliuzhuang, northernmost is Luokou, southernmost is Dongbaliwa.
- The author remembers that beyond Dianliuzhuang was still dirt roads.
- Even after moving to near Olympic Sports Center (奥体附近) for more than ten years, the author still calls going to Quancheng Road ""going to the city,"" implying a mental map of what counts as the ""city"" or ""local"" core.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author expresses a local spatial classification of Jinan, based on childhood memories and habitual perceptions of city boundaries and neighborhood areas.
- The author implicitly defines ""local"" by these habitual spatial boundaries (e.g., what is considered ""city"" vs. outskirts).
- This is a classic example of RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author uses collective emotional maps and local habitual perceptions of spatial boundaries to define ""local"" areas.

- 老济南人 (old Jinan people)
- 天桥槐荫那块 (Tianqiao Huaiyin area)
- 领秀城附近 (near Lingxiu City)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author says not all old Jinan people recognize the same area as ""local.""
- The author emphasizes that someone who lived in Tianqiao Huaiyin area for 20 years as a child, and then moved to near Lingxiu City after becoming wealthy, represents the true ""old Jinan"" local.
- This suggests that the author uses the history of living/growing up in a place (childhood residence) plus later residential choices as the criteria for being ""old Jinan.""

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The emphasis on living in a place ""小时候呆了20年"" (stayed there 20 years in childhood) is a clear indicator of RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The mention of moving to ""领秀城附近"" (near Lingxiu City) after becoming wealthy implies an evaluation of residence choice, but the core standard for local identity is rootedness in childhood living.
- No explicit mention of administrative boundaries or dialect or social embeddedness.
- The phrase ""这才是老济南的缩影"" (this is the epitome of old Jinan people) indicates the author endorses this standard.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matched to entities:
- 洪楼 is described as ""very convenient,"" mentioning metro access.
- Recommendations to visit several places (parks, night market, church, museum) are given.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author highlights the convenience of 洪楼, specifically mentioning the subway and amenities, implying the functional livability of the area.
- The other places are recommended for visiting but do not relate to defining ""local person"" identity.
- There is no explicit or implicit argument about local identity based on administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- The convenience and facilities (subway, park, night market) relate to RL5 (Functional Livability).
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity, only describing area convenience.
- Since the task requires the standard to be used for defining ""local person"" identity, and here it is about convenience for living or visiting, not identity definition, RL5 is not annotated.

Step 4: Conclusion:
- No recognition logic categories meet the criteria for defining ""local person"" identity.

This reflects a local shared perception of what counts as ""Old Jinan"" based on spatial/cultural boundaries, not official boundaries.
- 济南市区: The author acknowledges the urban area has expanded, mentioning multiple expansions and annexations of nearby areas like 莱芜 and 章丘. The author accepts that the city area is now larger.
- 莱芜 and 章丘: Mentioned as having been merged into Jinan.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- For 老济南, the author uses a vernacular spatial perception to define the core ""old"" area, emphasizing local colloquial understanding (""we say it like this""). This is RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.
- For the expansions of the city (莱芜, 章丘 merged in), the author refers to administrative changes (""并入济南了""), which is an appeal to official administrative legitimacy for defining the city's scope. This is RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.

- 二环外 (outside the second ring)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author’s grandfather believes that ""inside the moat"" is considered Jinan.  
- The author’s aunt feels that after marrying into Quanfudistrict, she is considered as ""married out,"" implying Quanfudistrict is outside the local identity.  
- The author (an 80s generation person) feels the urban area is still inside the second ring road, and returning home past the second ring east is considered entering the city.  
- Although the east develops faster than other areas (second ring south, north, west), the author still internally considers it ""outside the second ring.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author and relatives use spatial boundaries and emotional or cultural perceptions of city boundaries (moat, second ring road) as standards to define ""local"" identity or what counts as the core city area.  
- This reflects a shared, habitual, historically sedimented local perception of intra-city spatial categories, not official administrative boundaries.  
- The aunt’s remark about ""married out"" indicates social recognition of belonging or not belonging based on locality.

- When they go to university, they say they are from Jinan.
- People from other districts think the author is ""碰瓷"" (pretending or trying to claim a status).
- The author compares Zhangqiu City to a district, implying Zhangqiu City is not inferior or less prestigious than a district of Jinan.
- The author expresses a feeling or argument that Zhangqiu should be considered on par with districts of Jinan.

Step 3: Recognition Logic analysis:
- The author is discussing the relationship between Zhangqiu and Jinan, specifically the status of Zhangqiu as a city vs. other districts in Jinan.
- The core argument is about the administrative status and legitimacy of Zhangqiu as a city or district.
- The author is implicitly rejecting the idea that only districts of Jinan count as ""Jinan locals,"" and suggests Zhangqiu City is equally legitimate.
- This relates to **Administrative Legitimacy** (RL2), since the author is talking about city/district administrative divisions and the legitimacy of being considered ""local"" based on such administrative boundaries.

Step 3: The author discusses administrative division boundaries (""被划进来的"" meaning ""being划进来,"" i.e., being included into the city jurisdiction), which is an appeal to official administrative divisions as a basis for local identity. The complaint about being ""划进来"" suggests resistance to administrative legitimacy as a criterion, but the author does not endorse this standard; rather, they express dislike for it. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy as a standard to define local identity. The mention of ""靠济南市区"" is spatial but only to claim economic or demographic status, not to define local identity. No evidence the author uses vernacular spatial authority or other recognition logics to define local identity here.

Step 2: The author discusses the public transportation network in Jinan, noting that the metro mostly circles the urban outskirts, and traveling to the city center (east, south, west, north) by bus or taxi is inconvenient.

Step 3: The author is focusing on the convenience of living and transportation infrastructure in different parts of the city. This relates to evaluating an area's livability or convenience, which corresponds to Recognition Logic 5 (Functional Livability). However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly connect this to defining who is a ""local person"" or local identity. The focus is on transport and convenience, not identity definition.

Step 4: According to task instructions, since the text does not express standards for defining ""local person"" identity, no RL categories should be annotated.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matched to entity:
- The roommate emphasizes that the double-decker bus line runs in Licheng District.
- The roommate seems to use the double-decker bus as a symbol or marker of ""her area"" or identity.
- The author expresses confusion and does not see the double-decker bus as something special or identity-defining.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The roommate's emphasis on the double-decker bus being from ""their area"" suggests a kind of spatial identity marker, possibly RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it relates to local area identity.
- However, the author does not explicitly endorse this logic, but rather finds it unremarkable.
- The author describes the roommate's behavior but does not endorse the idea that the bus or the bus line is a defining standard for ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not discuss administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification in relation to ""local person"" identity.
- Therefore, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use any recognition logic to define ""local person"" identity in this text.

Step 3: The author implies that 龙洞's identity as a ""local"" or being part of the core city is not judged by administrative boundaries (济南市区) but by its expensive status. However, the author does not endorse using price or wealth as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity, only reports that 龙洞 itself does not care about administrative belonging, only price.

But since the author only says 龙洞 ""does not care whether it belongs to 济南市区, only knows it is the most expensive,"" and the author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse price as a standard to define ""local person,"" and the author does not use administrative division as a standard either, just reports 龙洞's attitude.

- The author says when they were very young, they considered Licheng as a suburb (""郊区"").
- Regarding Laiwu, the author mentions it was just recently merged (""刚合过去的"").
- The majority of Laiwu people still identify as Laiwu locals (""归属感上还是认同自己是莱芜人"").

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The view that Licheng is a suburb relates to a shared local perception of spatial categories and boundaries that differ from official administrative boundaries. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of Laiwu recently merging is an administrative fact but the author emphasizes the locals' own feeling of identity distinct from the administrative change. The author does not explicitly use administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a standard but acknowledges the administrative merger.
- The emphasis on people's sense of belonging (认同) to Laiwu locals suggests the author recognizes the importance of collective local identity perception rather than just administrative status. This again aligns with RL1.
- The author does not mention hukou or official registration as the basis for local identity, so RL2 is not endorsed.

一部分在历下一部分在历城吧 高新不是行政区划啊,Recognition Logic 2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 历下
- 历城
- 高新

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says ""高新不是行政区划啊"" (""Gaoxin is not an administrative district""), which implies a distinction between administrative boundaries and other spatial categories.
- The mention of 历下 and 历城 together with this statement suggests the author is distinguishing between administrative legitimacy (administrative districts) and other spatial understandings.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes that ""高新"" is not an administrative division, which suggests a recognition of administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a standard.
- The differentiation implies that administrative boundaries matter for defining ""local"" identity.
- The text does not mention family roots, dialect, or other criteria.
- The author seems to endorse the administrative boundary as a criterion (or at least emphasizes it), rather than vernacular or other logics.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author claims their family has been in the city area for three generations, implying a long family rootedness.
- For old Nanchang locals, the city center is considered the commercial area near Bayi Square.
- The author mentions that 34 years ago, Erqi North Road was considered suburban.
- The author seems to accept or describe the local perception of the city center boundaries and spatial distinctions.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""家里三代都在市区"" (family has been in the city for three generations) aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The description of the city center as the commercial area near Bayi Square and the historical perception of Erqi North Road as suburban reflects the shared local perceptions of spatial boundaries and their symbolic meaning, consistent with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- For 南昌, the author discusses that many central areas exist with different positioning.
- For 红谷滩, the author states that if ranking by house prices, it is the best.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is judging which area is ""best"" based on house prices.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly say that house price is a standard for defining who is a local person.
- The author only talks about area positioning and house prices, which relates to property value or social status, but not to ""local person"" identity.

- The author says 红谷滩 used to be wilderness but now is a new district; it is good for showing off (""拿出去比面子"").
- However, the author claims that for ""本地人"" (locals), the city center is only 八一广场.
- The author's childhood memories of 南昌 are centered around 八一广场 area.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes between official or new areas (红谷滩) and the traditional core local area (八一广场) recognized by locals.
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic: locals recognize 八一广场 as the true city center, not the newer district.
- The author also uses personal childhood memory (""小时候对南昌的记忆"") as evidence, indicating a family rootedness or individual growth history dimension.
- However, the emphasis is more on the spatial and emotional mapping of what counts as ""local"" area, rather than formal administrative status or family lineage.
- The author contrasts the ""面子"" use of 红谷滩 with the authentic local recognition of 八一广场, highlighting the symbolic spatial perception.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic categories:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The author asserts the local people's recognition of the city center as 八一广场, despite new developments.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author, a native Nanchang person, states that the city center is the area around Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, and Ruzi Road.
- Honggutan was previously undeveloped and later developed.
- Many outsiders lived in Honggutan before, but now Honggutan is well developed.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author defines the ""local"" city center as specific areas historically recognized by natives (Donghu District, Bayi Square, etc.).
- The distinction between old city center and new developed area (Honggutan) with many outsiders implies a vernacular spatial classification.
- The author uses collective local perception to define which parts are considered the ""real"" city center and which parts are less traditionally local.

- The author grew up in 红谷滩 (formerly 昌北), which was once a barren area.
- It was commonly said that only past 八一桥 was considered the ""real 南昌"".
- People would say going to 东湖 means going to 南昌.
- 红谷滩 developed later with new buildings, metro, CBD, government relocations.
- The area was renamed from 红谷滩新区 to 红谷滩区.
- The author accepts that now 红谷滩 can be considered 南昌's city center.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses the historical and common local perception about which areas ""count"" as the real city center (past 八一桥 is real 南昌), reflecting vernacular spatial authority (RL1).
- The mention of government relocation and renaming to 红谷滩区 suggests administrative legitimacy as a factor (RL2).
- No explicit mention of family roots or linguistic/cultural markers.

- 八一广场、中山路、步行街、东湖西湖区作为“市中心”被描述，体现了作者对市中心空间范围的认知，强调“当地人”对空间的惯常认知和历史沉淀，属于RL1（乡土空间权威）。
- 提到政治中心迁移及其带来的发展，暗示行政区划和政治中心的变化影响城市空间认同，但作者并未强调行政区划作为界定“本地人”的标准，更多是叙述发展过程，未形成明确的行政合法性认同，因此RL2不明显。
- 童年时“脚上全是泥”，“耕田回来的”表明作者强调自己在农村环境成长的经历，体现家族或个人成长历史的认同，符合RL3（家族根植性）。
- 对红谷滩、新建区的发展和母校的喜欢，表达对成长地的情感认同，隐含文化认同，但未直接涉及方言或语言文化特征，RL4不明显。

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author explicitly states that in their eyes, the definition of a local person depends solely on administrative boundaries. If an area belongs to Qingdao administratively (including Jiaozhou or Chengyang), then people from there are considered Qingdao locals. The author notes that previously people might have felt distant due to inconvenient transportation, but now with metro and driving, the distance is negligible.

- 胶南, 胶州: The author notes that many elderly people in Qingdao urban areas have relatives from Jiaonan and Jiaozhou, and that these relatives came to the city starting from the grandfather's generation.  
- 市区: The author discusses educational performance (""高考升学率"") being lower than county-level cities, attributing it partly to lack of competition (""不卷"").  
- 县级市: The author acknowledges that county-level cities have produced many well-known enterprises, i.e., economically successful.  
- 香港路: The author recalls that Hong Kong Road was a small village when they were in kindergarten.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author self-identifies as a native of Shinan district, emphasizing family historical roots going back to grandparents' generation in the city, suggesting RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The mention of elderly people in the city having relatives in nearby county-level cities who moved in since grandfather's generation further supports RL3, emphasizing generational family ties as a basis of identity.  
- The discussion about education and economic success of county-level cities does not serve as a criterion for defining who is local or not; rather, it is a comparative observation, so no RL5 or RL6.  
- The mention of Hong Kong Road being a small village in the author's childhood is a historical spatial reference, but the author does not use this to define local identity boundaries explicitly; it is more reminiscence than defining local spatial identity, so RL1 is weak or absent here.  
- No mention of dialect, administrative status, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is used as identity criteria.

- 济南: The author is from Jinan and they currently live there. The author teaches the child to say she is a Jinan person, with ancestral roots in Pingdu.  
- 青岛: The father often calls himself a Qingdao person but is laughed at by real Qingdao people. This implies that the author does not accept Qingdao identity for the father, probably because of lack of family roots or official status.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): The daughter's hukou being Pingdu is mentioned, indicating hukou as a basis for local identity.  
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): The father is described as 土生土长 (born and raised) in Pingdu, which is a family rootedness argument. The author emphasizes the importance of family origin and upbringing in defining local identity.

- 别的区: More houses are single-story (平房), with inconvenient transportation and poor environment.
- The author explains that the ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain) appeared because of these differences.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author relates local identity distinctions to the type of housing and transportation environment of districts.
- The focus is on spatial differences in living conditions and infrastructure.
- The author implies that the ""鄙视链"" (disdain hierarchy) arises from functional livability factors (transportation, housing type, environment).
- The author does not discuss administrative boundaries or family roots or dialect.
- The author does not explicitly say these are criteria to define ""local person,"" but by discussing the disdain chain linked to these spatial and environmental features, the author implicitly acknowledges functional livability as a standard for evaluating local area quality.
- Since the disdain chain relates to local area distinctions, and the author understands this logic, RL5 is relevant.

- 市南 (Shinan District)
- 崂山 (Laoshan District)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 市南: Initially not considered prosperous or convenient, but after redevelopment and renovation, it became superior (""睥睨众生了""), with better new supporting facilities than before.
- 崂山: Implied similarity to the current status of 市南 after redevelopment, i.e., prosperous and well-equipped.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author focuses on the improvement of infrastructure, amenities, and convenience (""新建的配套"", ""比原先的好"") to evaluate the area's status.
- The author uses these functional livability factors as a standard to judge the quality or status of these districts.
- There is no explicit or implicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority as defining ""local person.""

青岛鄙视链的陋习延续这么多年了..还是没有任何改变...曾经的老西镇看谁都是老巴子.. 到老台东看谁都很土..不洋气.. 直到市南辛家庄拆迁改造后开始看不起一切众生了... 从前的老青岛人只承认市内四区（市南>市北>四方>李沧）崂山区都被排除在外的... 更何况七区五市之外的了..所谓土生土长的青岛人..真觉得这个陋习什么时候能改变？,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 青岛 (Qingdao), 老西镇 (Old West Town), 老巴子 (old locals), 老台东 (Old Taidong), 市南辛家庄 (Shinan Xinjiazhuang), 市南 (Shinan), 市北 (Shibei), 四方 (Sifang), 李沧 (Licang), 崂山区 (Laoshan District), 七区五市 (seven districts and five cities).

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matched to entities:
- The author describes a longstanding ""鄙视链"" (contempt hierarchy) in Qingdao, historically recognizing only the four districts inside the city (市南, 市北, 四方, 李沧) as legitimate local areas, excluding 崂山区 and certainly areas beyond the seven districts and five cities.
- The old locals only accepted those from the four districts as ""土生土长"" (native born and bred) locals.
- The disdain towards other areas is expressed as a ""陋习"" (bad habit) that persists without change.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author highlights a traditional spatial classification of ""local"" identity, emphasizing acceptance only of people from certain core urban districts, while excluding others based on their location within or outside these administrative or commonly recognized urban boundaries.
- The focus is on habitual and shared local perceptions about which areas count as ""real"" local areas, i.e., a vernacular spatial authority distinguishing insiders vs outsiders.
- The emphasis on ""土生土长"" (native born and bred) could suggest RL3 (family rootedness), but the author uses this term to describe the attitude of old locals rather than explicitly endorsing it as a personal standard.
- The author criticizes this spatial-based hierarchy as a ""陋习"" and questions when it will change, implying they do not endorse it, but merely report its existence.
- Since the author does not endorse the ""鄙视链"" or the exclusion of 崂山区 and areas outside the seven districts and five cities, but rather reports it as a persistent social fact, no endorsement of RL1 is explicit.
- The mention of ""市内四区"" and ""七区五市之外"" references administrative boundaries but is used to describe local perceptions rather than official administrative legitimacy.
- There is no mention of hukou or legal registration as basis for identity, so RL2 is not applicable.
- No mention of dialect, social embeddedness, livability, or occupational typification.

Step 4: Output:
The author mainly reports a vernacular spatial authority perception but does not endorse it. They describe the spatial scope of ""local"" areas as recognized by old locals but call it a bad habit. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any recognition logic as a personal standard for defining local identity.

- 李村 (Li Village)
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)
- 市南 (Shinan District)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author is from 李村.
- A colleague from 胶州 who rents in 市南 says that 李村 does not belong to the city area (市区).
- The author finds this amusing and then learns the colleague is from 胶州.
- The author feels the colleague is arrogantly making claims (""给我拽上了还"" roughly ""acting high and mighty towards me"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The colleague’s claim that 李村 does not belong to 市区 reflects a spatial classification logic about what areas are considered ""city"" or ""local"" (who counts as local). This is a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1), because it involves local perceptions about city boundaries and inclusion.
- The author implicitly rejects the colleague's spatial classification because the colleague is from outside (胶州), but the author themself seems to endorse that 李村 is local or part of the city.
- The author’s identity claim is linked to spatial belonging and local identity based on area inclusion.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, hukou, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The core logic is about local spatial classification and who counts as local based on area.

- The author states that 平度 used to belong to 潍坊 administratively.
- Some older generation people from 平度 feel a stronger sense of belonging to 潍坊 than to 青岛.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention that 平度 ""used to belong to 潍坊"" and the older generation's stronger ""sense of belonging"" to 潍坊 indicates reliance on **administrative legitimacy** as a basis for local identity.
- The contrast of emotional belonging between older generation people implies recognition of historical administrative boundaries influencing identity.
- The emphasis on ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) linked to administrative past suggests RL2.

No mention or implication of family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, livability, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority is evident here.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- ""我市南土生土长的"" (born and raised in the southern part of my city) implies family rootedness and personal growth history.  
- ""嫁了胶州小伙子，因为孩子上学所以我们就住胶州了"" (married a man from Jiaozhou and live there because of children's schooling) suggests residential choice linked to family reasons.  
- ""我家市区有七八套房子，胶州城阳也都有房子"" (our family owns multiple houses in the city center, Jiaozhou, and Chengyang) indicates possession of local property assets.  
- ""我爸妈现在住崂山"" (parents live in Laoshan) states current residence.  
- Neighbors say ""我终于从村里进城了"" (I finally moved from the village into the city), indicating a social perception of moving from rural to urban, possibly implying social embeddedness or spatial identity.  
- A question ""你在胶州是不是住不上有暖气的房子"" (do you not have a house with heating in Jiaozhou) implies local housing quality or livability standards.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- ""生土生土长的"" (born and raised locally) aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- Ownership of multiple houses in various areas and the implied social recognition of moving from village to city relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as property and social ties indicate local integration and identity.  
- The mention of housing with heating (暖气) touches on living function and environmental quality, which corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).  
- The distinction between village and city neighbors' perception hints at RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as locals use spatial categories (village vs. city) to define identity.

- 新青岛话 (New Qingdao dialect)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- 即墨话 (including Laoshan, Chengyang, Licun, Pingdu) is considered the ""authentic"" or ""genuine"" local Qingdao dialect.  
- 新青岛话 is described as a dialect formed by the collision and fusion of dialects from outsiders (migrants) and local dialects.  
- The author feels that 即墨话 is ""noble"" or ""high status"" compared to 新青岛话.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author uses dialect (即墨话 vs 新青岛话) as a criterion for distinguishing authentic local people from outsiders or migrants.  
- The argument is that only those speaking 即墨话 (the ""authentic"" local dialect) represent the ""genuine local"" identity, while 新青岛话 is a mixed dialect due to immigration.  
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, because the dialect/accent is used as a proxy to define local person identity.

- 青岛大姨: She despises the author, saying that the author is an outsider because they live in Huangdao, implying Huangdao is not really part of Qingdao.  
- 黄岛: The author acknowledges that although they own property in Huangdao, it is just a possession and does not automatically make them a Qingdao local.  
- 青岛: The author insists that through working, earning, settling down, and building social circles in Qingdao, they have established their local identity, regardless of whether ""native"" Qingdao people recognize it.  
- 辽宁: The author’s origin, showing they are from outside Qingdao.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic  
- The auntie’s claim that living in Huangdao does not count as being ""Qingdao local"" reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), i.e., local perceptions of which areas count as core Qingdao.  
- The author accepts this spatial perception but rejects it as the sole standard for identity, noting their efforts in working and social embedding in Qingdao.  
- The author emphasizes their ""安家落户"" (settling down), ""积攒生活圈子和朋友圈子"" (accumulating life and social circles), indicating RL6 (Social Embeddedness) as a basis for local identity.  
- The author rejects the idea that they need recognition from ""a fisherman’s descendants"" (i.e., native locals) to confirm their identity, implying a rejection of RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The author also points out economic and social interactions (eating at Qingdao people’s restaurants, buying from Qingdao people’s market stalls, taking taxis owned by Qingdao people), which reinforces RL6 (Social Embeddedness) as evidence of their local integration.

The author argues that these places (即墨市, 胶州市, 莱西市, 胶南市, 平度市) were historically independent cities at the same administrative level as 青岛市 and only merged administratively in the last decade or so. The author rejects the idea that these merged areas should be considered subordinate or less ""local"" compared to 青岛市. The author also notes differences in dialect and habits, emphasizing ""you are not me"" and implying cultural-linguistic differences.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author's argument that these places were historically independent cities at the same level before administrative mergers points to **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2)** because the author focuses on administrative status and official city-level status as the legitimate basis for identity.  
- The mention of ""大家说话口音完全不一样他部分习惯也不同"" (""everyone's dialects are completely different, and some habits differ"") indicates a reliance on dialect and cultural habits to distinguish identity, which aligns with **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4)**.  
- The author denies discrimination and insists on equality based on past city status and dialect differences, implicitly using these as identity criteria.

- The author claims that the ""local people"" or ""土著"" are the people of 即墨, meaning the territory historically recognized as 即墨 from the Sui dynasty to the late Qing dynasty, not including Pingdu, Laixi, Jiaozhou, Huangdao.
- The author defines the local identity based on a historically unified cultural, linguistic, and customary region (""大一统"" meaning cultural-linguistic unity) of 即墨 county.
- The author distinguishes the ""real"" 即墨 from the current administrative areas, explicitly excluding Pingdu's ""ancient Jimo settlement"" from the local identity.
  
Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses a historically sedimented spatial-cultural boundary (excluding some administrative areas but including others based on historical unity and cultural-linguistic continuity). This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author emphasizes cultural-linguistic unity (""人文方言文化习俗统一"") as a basis for defining the local identity, which indicates RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author refers to historical lineage of the area since the Sui dynasty to Qing dynasty, indicating a temporal depth of rootedness but not explicitly about family roots or generational family ties. It is more about historical spatial-cultural continuity, not family lineage, so RL3 is not strongly supported.
- The author excludes certain administrative regions (e.g., Pingdu) but does not base the definition on current administrative divisions or hukou, so RL2 is not supported.

- 城阳舍友 rejects a boy from 黄岛 despite his kindness.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- 城阳舍友's claim that 胶州 is not part of 青岛 because it is not a district is an appeal to official administrative boundaries — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- 胶州舍友's complaint about 胶南 being poor but made a district, and 胶州 not, also relates to administrative division legitimacy — RL2.
- 城阳舍友's preference for dating boys from 市南 or 市北, and rejection of a boy from 黄岛, implies social or cultural hierarchy attached to districts, but the text does not explicitly state that this is a standard for defining ""local person"" identity; it is more personal preference.

我老公认识我的时候，说他是黄岛的，拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系～很长一段时间我单纯的以为黄岛是一个单独的地方，跟青岛没关～,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 黄岛, 青岛

Step 2: The author recounts that her husband identifies himself as from 黄岛 and refuses to acknowledge any relation to 青岛. The author initially thought 黄岛 was a separate place from 青岛.

Step 3: The husband's self-identification as ""黄岛的"" and refusal to link to 青岛 reflects a logic of spatial classification based on local perceptions of area boundaries or identity. The author reports this as a perception of the local spatial identity. This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it involves shared or habitual local understandings of area boundaries and identity.

No explicit mention of administrative divisions or hukou, so RL2 is not clearly endorsed by the author.

No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.

- The author admits that 胶东机场 is far from 市区.
- The author comments on 市区 people often referring to 潍坊机场 as ""潍坊建的机场.""
- The author sarcastically questions if 胶州 has been administratively assigned to 潍坊 because of this.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author’s sarcasm about ""胶州被你们划到潍坊去了"" implies a critique or commentary on administrative boundaries and local identity.
- The argument centers on administrative division and the legitimacy of place belonging.
- The author implicitly uses administrative legitimacy (hukou or district boundaries) as a standard for defining local identity or area belonging.

这个鄙视链是在老一辈那，因为当时青岛交通不发达，只有市南市北住人多，李沧黄岛是农村种地多。,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 青岛 (Qingdao)  
- 市南市北 (Shinan and Shibei districts)  
- 李沧 (Licang district)  
- 黄岛 (Huangdao district)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author states that the ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain) existed in the older generation because, at that time, Qingdao's transportation was underdeveloped. Only Shinan and Shibei had many residents, while Licang and Huangdao were mostly rural farming areas. This implies a spatial classification of areas based on historical and social perceptions of urban vs. rural status.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
The author is referencing a historical spatial hierarchy tied to the development and urbanization of districts in Qingdao. The distinction between urban districts (市南市北) and rural farming districts (李沧黄岛) reflects a vernacular spatial authority — a shared local perception about which areas ""count"" as core urban areas or ""locals"" and which are considered peripheral or rural. This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 2: The author reflects on their childhood perception that certain places (平度、即墨) were not considered part of 青岛, similarly for other city-suburb relations. This perception is described as a ""narrow sense"" of the city and is related to everyday language causing fuzzy boundaries, but not discrimination.

Step 3: The author is describing a common local perception of which areas count as part of a city or not, based on habitual or colloquial understandings rather than administrative boundaries. This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 4: Output the corresponding recognition logic.

我外地人在青岛生活十多年，公里公道说句，其实日常生活中青岛人没有表现出来青岛区域歧视，但是在偶有的聊天或者一些言论里，能看出来多少会带点儿那种感觉，比如他们会特指一些，像说那个沧口曼儿，或者说青岛话的口音，会问你家哪个区的，城阳的，哦，怪不得，你们懂那种感觉吧，但毕竟我不是青岛人，就听他们聊天中就会有那种地域划分和主城区优越感的只字片语，倒是说不上歧视什么的,"RL1, RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 青岛 (Qingdao)
- 沧口曼儿 (Cangkou area)
- 城阳 (Chengyang district)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 青岛: The author is an outsider living in Qingdao for over ten years, observes no overt regional discrimination by Qingdao locals but notes subtle regional distinctions in conversations.
- 沧口曼儿: Mentioned as a specific local area referenced with certain connotations.
- 城阳: Mentioned as a district whose residents might be subtly regarded with a sense of hierarchy or difference.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author notes that locals refer to specific districts (Cangkou, Chengyang) and use dialect/accent (青岛话的口音) to identify or categorize people.
- This indicates a local habitual or cultural spatial classification (RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of dialect/accent as a marker of local identity points to RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- The author describes subtle hierarchical feelings associated with main urban areas vs. other districts, indicating recognition of spatial identity differences.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards.
- The author is an outsider and does not claim these standards for themselves but reports the local discourse, which they partially accept as existing.
- The author does not oppose these views and acknowledges their presence as part of local identity recognition.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author identifies as a native ""土生土长平度人"" and specifically from ""平度南村"".
- The author recounts local seasonal agricultural products and local food traditions, expressing emotional attachment to these local cultural elements.
- The author contrasts Pingdu with other places (寿光) in terms of agricultural production but still values Pingdu's local characteristics.
- The author notes Pingdu lacks large commercial infrastructure or high-tech industries and has economic difficulties.
- Despite these, the author expresses a nostalgic affection for local small businesses, street vendors, and local food, indicating a cultural rootedness and emotional bond.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The author clearly defines ""local person"" identity by family and growth history (""土生土长"", ""高中搬家到一中附近"") which fits RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The emphasis on local seasonal products, local food traditions, and the nostalgic attachment to specific local places and customs indicates a cultural-linguistic or cultural identity recognition, fitting RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author also contrasts the lack of modern infrastructure and economic development, but this is described as a fact, not as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity, so RL5 (Functional Livability) is not endorsed as a criterion.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries or hukou, so RL2 is not applicable.
- The author does not discuss social embeddedness via property or social networks, so RL6 is not applicable.
- No mention of occupation-based typification, so RL7 is not applicable.
- The author does not define spatial boundaries or city scope, so RL1 is not applicable.

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。","RL1, RL4","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 城阳 (Chengyang)  
- 青岛 (Qingdao)  
- 黄岛 (Huangdao)  
- 即墨 (Jimo)  
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)  
- 莱西 (Laixi)  
- 市南区 (Shinan District)  
- 崂山 (Laoshan)  
- 上海 (Shanghai)  
- 香港 (Hong Kong)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 城阳、黄岛、即墨、胶州、莱西:  
  * Not recognized by main urban area residents (""大姨群体"") as true ""Qingdao"" locals (point 1).  
  * Education segregation: students from these areas can't attend key city high schools or district experimental schools (point 2).  
  * Dialect/accent differences: local people have stronger local dialects compared to more Mandarin-like accents in main urban area (point 3).  
  * Transportation barriers: tolls on main routes connecting these districts to the city center create psychological and physical separation (point 4).  
  * Economic development uneven: main urban area ranks highest in per capita disposable income (point 6).  
  * Discrimination experienced by people from these areas studying/working in main urban area (point 7).  

- 青岛主城区 (Main urban area of Qingdao):  
  * Residents often immigrants with more Mandarin-like accent and use of foreign loanwords (point 3).  
  * They hold a sense of superiority and exclude other districts from ""Qingdao"" identity (point 1, 5).  

- 上海、香港:  
  * Used as analogies for similar exclusionary, identity conflicts (point 5, summary).  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):  
  * The author discusses that although administratively all districts belong to Qingdao, the ""main urban area"" residents do not recognize other districts as true ""Qingdao"" locals. This shows a vernacular spatial boundary and local emotional map about who counts as local.  
  * The ""城郊对立"" (urban vs suburban) is a vernacular spatial classification.  
  * The author explicitly notes ""算不算青岛"" is essentially a ""city-suburb opposition"" and that the ""main urban area"" is the real Qingdao in local perception.  
- RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):  
  * The author notes that all districts belong administratively to Qingdao, but this is contrasted with local recognition. So administrative boundaries exist but are not accepted as defining local identity. The author does not use administrative logic to define local identity; rather, the author points out that administrative boundaries are insufficient.  
  * Hence, RL2 is **not endorsed** as a standard by the author for defining local identity; it is mentioned only to contrast vernacular logic.  
- RL3 (Family Rootedness):  
  * The author mentions that main urban area residents are mostly immigrants, while other districts have more locals with stronger dialects, but does not explicitly endorse family rootedness or generational depth as a defining criterion.  
  * No explicit or implicit emphasis on family roots or generational settlement as identity standard.  
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):  
  * The author highlights dialect and accent differences, noting that main urban residents speak more Mandarin-like accents with foreign loanwords, while suburban locals have stronger local dialects.  
  * This dialect difference is a source of superiority and exclusion by main urban area residents.  
  * The author describes this linguistic-cultural difference as a significant identity marker used by locals.  
- RL5 (Functional Livability):  
  * The author discusses transportation tolls isolating districts from the main urban area, causing psychological and physical separation.  
  * Also mentions economic development differences (income levels), but the author criticizes GDP and focuses on fairness rather than using these as identity standards.  
  * The author does not endorse functional livability as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity but points out infrastructural separations as a cause of social division.  
  * So RL5 is mentioned but not endorsed as a definition standard.  
- RL6 (Social Embeddedness):  
  * The author mentions discrimination experienced by people from other districts in main urban area contexts but does not mention property ownership, community ties, or social embeddedness as a criterion for local identity.  
- RL7 (Occupational Typification):  
  * No mention of occupation-based typification or class/occupation-based identity distinctions.  

Step 4: Output the results  
The author endorses or describes the following standards as used or recognized in defining ""local person"" identity in Qingdao:  
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The ""urban vs suburban"" vernacular boundary, emotional maps of who counts as local.  
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): Dialect and accent differences as identity markers.

你这种海归硕士去市南或者地铁溜一圈一大推大姨让你娶她曼很喜欢你这种高学历的,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 市南 (Shinan District)  
- 地铁 (subway)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author describes that in 市南 or when taking the subway, many ""aunties"" (大姨) show interest in marrying someone like the author (a high-educated sea-returned master's degree holder). This implies a social recognition or embeddedness linked to educational background and local social circles.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author implies that their high education and presumably social status are recognized and valued by local social groups (""aunties"") in 市南 or on the subway. This relates to social embeddedness and possibly economic status.  
- The mention of 市南 and subway situates the social interaction spatially but does not explicitly discuss spatial legitimacy or administrative boundaries.  
- The focus is on social connections and recognition based on education and social integration.

Step 4: Output the results  
The relevant recognition logic is RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as the author emphasizes social recognition and acceptance tied to their education and presumably social position within a local area.

- 平度 (Pingdu)
- 莱西 (Laixi)
- 红岛 (Hongdao)
- 黄岛 (Huangdao)
- 流亭 (Liuting)
- 市内四区 (four urban districts)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author argues about the conceptual boundaries of ""Qingdao"" from different perspectives.
- From a city-level perspective, the author includes Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, West Coast as Qingdao, but considers Pingdu and Laixi too far and feels less belonging to them.
- From an island-level perspective, the author excludes Hongdao and Huangdao from Qingdao, considering them as parallel entities.
- The author defines Qingdao as including the area south of Liuting in Chengyang and the four urban districts.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind the author's viewpoint:
- The author is defining the ""local area"" of Qingdao not purely by official administrative boundaries but by personal or collective cognitive maps of which areas ""count"" as Qingdao and which do not.
- The author expresses a sense of belonging or lack thereof to certain areas based on proximity and conceptual boundaries.
- This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author uses habitual, emotional, or cognitive spatial categories rather than administrative divisions.
- The author mentions administrative divisions (city-level, island-level) but critiques or redefines these boundaries based on personal/local perceptions rather than official legitimacy, so RL2 is not strongly endorsed.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards.

完蛋，我们都是郊区人,":
Output: RL1","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 郊区 (suburbs/outskirts)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author calls themselves and others ""郊区人"" (people from the suburbs/outskirts), implying a shared identity associated with living in the suburbs rather than the urban core.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The term ""郊区人"" indicates a spatial classification based on habitual or common local perceptions of which areas are considered ""local"" or core urban areas and which are outskirts.
- The author implicitly accepts a logic that distinguishes ""local people"" by their spatial location within or outside main urban areas.
- This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), where the spatial boundary (urban vs. suburbs) is a key standard for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output results:

Step 2: The text says ""何止交通？医疗教育购物等等"" which translates roughly to ""Not just transportation? Medical care, education, shopping, etc."" This appears to be listing various urban functions or amenities.

Step 3: The author is emphasizing multiple aspects of urban functionality and convenience (transport, medical care, education, shopping). These relate to livability and convenience of living functions and environmental quality perception.

Step 4: The author implicitly agrees that these functional livability aspects are important criteria for evaluating an area, possibly as standards for defining or judging ""local"" areas.

Output: RL5"

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author sarcastically asks if those living inside the city wall are ""天龙人"" (a term implying elite or superior people) because they speak arrogantly, while others are ""乡下人"" (country people). This implies a recognition of a local identity distinction based on spatial residence (""inside the city wall"" vs. outside), and also the social attitude or cultural behavior (speech style).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses spatial location ""inside the city wall"" as a key identity marker, associating it with elite status (""天龙人"") and contrasting with ""乡下人"" outside. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), which involves habitual local perceptions of spatial boundaries and symbolic meanings.
- The mention of speech style (""讲话都这么吊了"") suggests a linguistic-cultural marker, but the author is using it to describe those inside the city wall as elite, implying linguistic-cultural recognition as part of local identity. This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Step 4: Output all matched recognition logic category labels.

按以前的行政区块，至少老下关、秦淮区城墙外的部分、雨花、建邺相当于城乡结合部，2000年以前仙林大学城那边还有不少农田的,"RL1, RL2","Step 1: Identify named entities:
- 老下关 (Old Xiaguan)
- 秦淮区城墙外的部分 (Parts outside the city wall of Qinhuai District)
- 雨花 (Yuhua)
- 建邺 (Jianye)
- 仙林大学城 (Xianlin University Town)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author states that according to the old administrative divisions, these areas (Old Xiaguan, parts outside the city wall of Qinhuai District, Yuhua, Jianye) were equivalent to urban-rural fringe areas, and that before 2000, Xianlin University Town still had a lot of farmland.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
The author uses ""old administrative divisions"" as a reference to classify these areas as urban-rural fringe, implying a standard of spatial identity based on administrative boundaries or historical administrative status.

The mention of farmland in Xianlin before 2000 indicates a historical spatial identity or perception tied to the area's rural nature.

Thus, the author relies on:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The author reflects on historically sedimented local perceptions of area identity (urban-rural fringe).
- RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): The author refers explicitly to ""old administrative divisions"" as a classification standard.

Step 4: Output the results:

以前城墙以内，现在按行政区划。如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了，太小。现在南京全部加一起也不大，再减就没啦,RL2,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 南京 (Nanjing)  
- 城墙以内 (within the city wall)  
- 行政区划 (administrative divisions)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- Previously, the local identity or city scope was defined as ""within the city wall.""  
- Now, the author states that the definition is based on ""administrative divisions.""  
- The author implies that the older spatial boundary (city wall) is too small and impractical for defining local identity today.  
- The author endorses the current use of administrative divisions as the standard for defining the local area.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The shift from historical spatial boundary (city wall) to administrative division indicates the author uses **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as the current standard for defining ""local person"" identity or the local area.  
- The mention of ""以前城墙以内"" (previously within the city wall) refers to vernacular spatial authority (RL1) but the author now rejects this as a standard and endorses administrative divisions instead.  
- Since the author explicitly favors administrative divisions as the current criterion, RL2 is the relevant recognition logic.  

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL2"
城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 城墙外 (outside the city wall)
- 夫子庙 (Confucius Temple)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author says ""城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了"" meaning when they were young, living outside the city wall, going to the Confucius Temple area was considered ""going into the city.""

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author expresses a local perception of spatial boundaries (""outside the city wall"" vs. ""going into the city""), implying a cognitive or cultural map of what counts as the core city or local area.
- This fits Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author relies on a shared local perception of spatial categories, not official administrative boundaries.

Step 4: Output:
Output: RL1"

Step 2: The author discusses how in the past, due to underdeveloped transportation, people felt that only the area inside the city walls counted as the main urban area. For example, students from Baixia District rarely went to Xiaguan District because it was far.

Step 3: The author is expressing a local perception of spatial boundaries based on historical transportation conditions and social habits, implying that the ""local"" area is defined by habitual, collective understandings of spatial proximity rather than official administrative boundaries.

This fits Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 4: Output the result.

- 城南 (South of the city)
- 万象城 (Wanxiang City)
- 瑞金路 (Ruijin Road)
- 解放门 (Jiefang Gate)
- 城墙城南 (City Wall South)
- 城墙城东 (City Wall East)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author says that when they were young, their family lived in the south of the city near Wanxiang City, and people thought Ruijin Road and Jiefang Gate were far away, specifically from the city wall south to city wall east felt very far due to inconvenient transportation.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author describes local perceptions of spatial divisions within the city, emphasizing how certain areas are considered far or near based on local habitual perceptions and emotional mapping rather than official boundaries. The mention of transportation inconvenience supports the subjective spatial sense. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because the author references local emotional or habitual spatial cognition about what counts as ""far"" or ""near"" within the city.

There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational types as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output result

nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 建邺 (Jianye)

Step 2: The author states ""我们建邺是乡下"" (Our Jianye is countryside), and ""进城要过河过桥进城墙的"" (To enter the city, one must cross river, bridge, and city wall). This implies a perception of spatial boundaries and a cognitive distinction between ""乡下"" (countryside) and ""城"" (city).

Step 3: This reflects a vernacular spatial authority (RL1) — the author uses local spatial perceptions (crossing rivers, bridges, city walls) as a boundary to define what counts as ""in the city"" or ""local.""

No mention of administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.

Step 4: Output the matched recognition logic.

小时候家里人都以城墙为界，城墙外都是郊区,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 城墙 (city wall)
- 郊区 (suburbs/outskirts)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that their family used the city wall as a boundary, and considered areas outside the city wall as suburbs.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
The author uses a spatial boundary (city wall) as a criterion for defining what counts as the core city area versus suburbs. This is a form of vernacular spatial authority, a local, habitual perception of city spatial categories that define local identity.

Step 4: Output:
Output: Recognition Logic 1"
跟钱有什么关系？ta说的主城区是历史沿革，优越感来自于底蕴，有底蕴不等于有钱，扯上海人做什么,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: ""主城区"" (main urban area), ""上海人"" (Shanghai people)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author emphasizes ""主城区是历史沿革"" (the main urban area is defined by historical evolution).
- ""优越感来自于底蕴"" (a sense of superiority comes from cultural/historical depth).
- ""有底蕴不等于有钱"" (having cultural/historical depth does not equal being wealthy).
- The mention of ""扯上海人做什么"" suggests rejecting the argument based on wealth or outsider identity.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The emphasis on ""历史沿革"" and ""底蕴"" aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses historically sedimented local perceptions to define the core local area.
- The author explicitly separates ""底蕴"" (cultural depth) from wealth, rejecting wealth as a standard.
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation as identity criteria.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states ""肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心"" which means ""Definitely convenient, Xianlin is the center of the universe.""
- The emphasis is on convenience and centrality.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author highlights convenience and centrality, which relates to material infrastructure and livability.
- This corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).

行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- 栖霞 (Qixia)  
- 句容 (Jurong)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author says administratively, Qixia is also a main urban area, but the edges of Qixia reach Jurong.  
- The author questions whether one can define local identity based on administrative boundaries (""能按行政区域划分？"").  
- The author states that locals never look at administrative divisions to define local identity (""本地人从来不看这个"").

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author explicitly rejects administrative division as a valid standard for defining who is a local person. So RL2 is rejected.  
- The author implies that locals rely on other criteria, probably vernacular spatial perceptions (common local understanding of what counts as local), rather than official administrative boundaries.  
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), since the author emphasizes that locals do not consider administrative boundaries but have their own habitual spatial perceptions.

- The author discusses how outsiders perceive different parts of Nanjing (e.g., New district is not well known, old city is the core), emphasizing the symbolic or habitual local perceptions of spatial areas rather than administrative boundaries. This is consistent with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or hukou, so RL2 is not applicable.

- There is no mention of family roots or generations, so RL3 is not applicable.

- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic features, so RL4 is not applicable.

- The author mentions the visual impression (tunnels vs. elevated roads) and the cityscape quality (walking in certain roads doesn’t feel bad), implying an evaluation of spatial environment and livability. This is consistent with RL5 (Functional Livability).

- No mention of social embeddedness or property ownership, so RL6 is not applicable.

- No mention of occupational groups or typification, so RL7 is not applicable.

- The author argues that receiving sour apricots from a neighbor does not imply that all ripe apricots are sweet.  
- Similarly, the author uses the analogy of cooking tomato scrambled eggs badly to argue that one bad example does not represent all.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The author is criticizing a logic that generalizes from one example to the whole category.  
- The text does not discuss any standard or logic about defining ""local person"" identity.  
- The discussion is about taste, cooking, and generalization, not about local identity standards.

- 延庆 (Yanqing)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author gives a series of associations and descriptions for each district, mostly highlighting landmarks, functions, or personal connections:  
- 东城: ""美术馆，北京名胜古迹集中营"" (art museums, concentration of Beijing historical sites), ""南锣鼓巷称为中国的‘秋叶原’"" (Nanluoguxiang called ""Akihabara of China"")  
- 西城: ""学霸集中营"" (concentration of top students), little impression except Beijing No.4 High School  
- 海淀: ""修电脑的，大学集中营，去漫展喽"" (computer repair, university cluster, go to comic conventions)  
- 朝阳: ""我家，好大"" (my home, very big)  
- 丰台: ""体育馆"" (stadium)  
- 石景山: ""石景山游乐园，我出生的地方，老山"" (Shijingshan amusement park, author's birthplace, Laoshan)  
- 门头沟、房山: ""好远"" (very far)  
- 通州: ""我奶奶家，以前叫通县，环球影城，以前落后现在发展特别好"" (grandma's home, formerly Tongxian, Universal Studios, formerly backward now developed very well)

- 延庆: ""只在天气预报见过龙庆峡，没去过"" (only seen Longqing Gorge on weather forecast, never been)  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author’s descriptions emphasize the symbolic or cultural meanings of areas (e.g., 东城 as cultural/historical hub, 西城 as academic hub, 海淀 as university and computer repair hub, 通州’s development, 昌平’s dense population).  
- The author identifies some places by personal or family roots (朝阳: ""我家"", 石景山: ""我出生的地方"", 通州: ""我奶奶家""). This implies family rootedness recognition.  
- The author notes accent differences for 怀柔, 平谷, 密云, implying linguistic-cultural recognition. The mention of accent implies a boundary marker for local identity.  
- The author’s description of areas by their symbolic meaning or common societal view (e.g., 东城’s art museums and historical sites, 西城’s academic reputation) aligns with vernacular spatial authority.  
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy or hukou.  
- No direct mention of social embeddedness like property ownership or community influence.  
- No occupational typification beyond general labels like ""学霸"" or ""修电脑的,"" which are more symbolic stereotypes than occupational identity defining localness.  
- No mention of functional livability standards like convenience or amenities as a criterion for localness.  

Step 4: Output the results  
The author uses:  
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): describing areas with symbolic/cultural meanings and collective emotional map labels (e.g., 东城, 西城, 海淀, 昌平)  
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): mentioning personal and family roots in 朝阳, 石景山, 通州  
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): noting accents in 怀柔, 平谷, 密云

Output: RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 密云, 密云水库, 镇 (town), 北京 (Beijing)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author notes that 密云 has some landmarks (reservoir, memorial halls), but transportation is inconvenient, relying only on buses.
- The author contrasts this with Beijing, which has subways.
- The author expresses that in the town, it's inconvenient to go anywhere, e.g., needs to ride a bike for an hour to reach the courier station.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author is discussing transportation convenience and accessibility as part of the evaluation of the area.
- The author implies that the lack of subway and reliance on bus-only transport makes the area less convenient or less livable.
- This corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability), since the author uses transportation convenience as a criterion to evaluate the quality of the area.

- The author does not mention administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority for defining ""local person"" identity.

- 海淀: 学校多 教育好 鸡娃 (many schools, good education, ""tiger mom"" culture)  
- 朝阳: 潮人多 外地人也多 (many trendy people, many outsiders)

- 怀柔: 北京后花园 (Beijing's backyard garden)  
- 平谷: 桃子 (peaches)  
- 密云: 水库 (reservoir)  
- 延庆: 冰灯 (ice lanterns)  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author is describing various districts by their attributes: housing prices, education, demographic composition, food, landmarks, distance, wealth, and natural scenery.  
- Are these descriptions used by the author to define ""local person"" identity or the ""local"" area scope or quality?  
- The text mainly lists characteristics or stereotypes of areas but does not explicitly or implicitly say these are standards to judge whether someone is a ""local person.""  
- The mention of ""外地人也多"" (many outsiders in Chaoyang) could imply some boundary between locals and outsiders but the author does not explicitly state this as a criterion for local identity.  
- No mention of administrative boundaries or hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as criteria for defining ""local person.""  
- The focus is on area characteristics, some relate to livability or environment (RL5), e.g., education, food, landmarks, wealth, distance. The author implicitly associates these areas with their functional or symbolic qualities.  
- However, the author does not say these qualities define who is a local or the local identity scope, but rather just describes the area features.  
- The mention ""外地人也多"" might be an implicit hint about outsiders, but no explicit or strong logic is stated that this is a criterion to define local identity.  
- Therefore, the author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse these as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.  

Step 4: Output the results  
No recognition logic categories apply because the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these criteria to define ""local person"" identity or local area scope. The text is descriptive, not prescriptive or evaluative in terms of identity definition.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is contrasting suburban vs city life mainly on lifestyle and environmental characteristics.
- There is no explicit or implicit statement about defining ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not mention administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types as criteria.
- The author is evaluating livability or lifestyle differences between areas.
- The mention of ""山好水好"" and ""生活节奏慢"" and ""玩的东西少"" suggests a perception of livability or comfort.
- The mention of subway and crowdedness relates to convenience but negatively.
- Therefore, the author is implicitly endorsing a standard related to livability or functional living environment to evaluate areas.

- 大兴 (Daxing)
- 怀柔 (Huairou)
- 平谷 (Pinggu)
- 密云 (Miyun)
- 延庆 (Yanqing)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
The author gives personal impressions or experiences associated with each district, often mentioning landmarks, activities, or social features. The descriptions are largely about places the author has been to or knows, with some evaluations like ""国际学校多有钱人多"" (Shunyi has many international schools and rich people) or ""去城里不方便"" (going to the city is inconvenient from Miyun). The text is a list of personal associations with each area, not explicitly stating who counts as a local or not.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly define ""local person"" identity by any administrative boundaries (RL2).
- No mention of family roots or generational history (RL3).
- No mention of dialect or language (RL4).
- No explicit discussion of social embeddedness or property ownership as identity criteria (RL6).
- No occupational typification (RL7).
- The author mentions some social impressions, e.g., ""国际学校多有钱人多"" (Shunyi), which relates to social status but the author does not use this to define local identity.
- The author mentions spatial distinctions with some subjective evaluations or emotional mappings, e.g., ""远远嘟"" (far away), ""去城里不方便"" (inconvenient to go to city), ""副中心"" (sub-center), ""环球影城"" (Universal Studios), ""红螺寺"" (Hongluo Temple), ""游乐园"" (amusement park), which could be considered as shared local spatial perceptions or emotional maps.
- The text reads like a cognitive map or collective emotional map of different city districts, with symbolic or cultural landmarks noted.
- The author implicitly accepts a certain spatial classification or perception of these districts by listing them and associating them with landmarks or social impressions.
- There is no explicit definition of who counts as local based on these, but the text reflects the author's vernacular spatial authority in mentally mapping the city.

Step 4: Output the results:
The author primarily uses vernacular spatial authority (RL1) by mapping districts with landmarks and social impressions, reflecting a local cognitive map. No other RL categories are strongly supported as defining local person identity.

- 怀柔: good air quality
- 房山: hominid fossil site
- 门头沟: floods
- 平谷: unfamiliar, has peaches

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses place-based cultural or symbolic labels to distinguish areas, e.g., 皇城根儿 for 西城 (historical core), tourist spots for 东城, trendy for 朝阳, academic reputation for 海淀, local specialties (watermelon, flowers, fish) for 大兴 and 丰台, natural environment for 密云, accent as a boundary marker for 延庆, which is ""not considered Beijing."" This shows a vernacular spatial classification (RL1).
- The mention of ""延庆：有口音 不算北京"" implies linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as a standard to exclude someone from being a ""local"" Beijing person.
- The academic tutoring in 海淀 and the identity of ""学霸"" (top students) may imply a local identity based on cultural/educational attributes but more as a cultural stereotype, fitting RL1 more than RL4.
- The accent in 延庆 is a clear linguistic marker, so RL4 applies.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family roots (RL3), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) is evident.
- The author does not discuss livability or convenience (RL5) as a standard to define local identity here.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

The author describes each area with emphasis on:
- Housing conditions and prices (old, small, dilapidated, high prices)
- Social composition or lifestyle (trendy and wealthy people, villa area)
- Functional attributes or livability (fun shopping malls, barbecue spots, good scenery, peaches, reservoirs, vacation potential)
- Distance (""very far"") as a negative factor

However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these features to define who is a ""local person."" There is no mention of hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

The text primarily evaluates areas by their physical characteristics, social atmosphere, and livability, but **does not link these as criteria to define ""local person"" identity**.

Step 2: The author expresses a wish that their home area, Huairou, also has a subway.

Step 3: The mention of the subway relates to infrastructure and convenience, which is about livability and urban functional quality.

The author implicitly endorses the standard that areas with better transit (subway) are more desirable or ""better local"" places.

Therefore, the recognition logic is RL5 (Functional Livability).

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
The author provides short, colloquial, and somewhat evaluative descriptions of these districts. Some descriptions mention social or functional features (e.g., ""钢"" for Shijingshan, ""城中村"" for Shijingshan, ""待富"" for Tongzhou, ""天通苑"" for Changping), or mention landmarks or events (e.g., ""水库"" for Miyun, ""冬奥"" for Yanqing). However, the text mainly lists these as common perceptions or stereotypes about the areas.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author implicitly uses **RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority**: The descriptions reflect collective social perceptions and stereotypes about these areas (e.g., ""城里人"" for Dongcheng and Xicheng, ""很那个的地方"" for Haidian, ""巨大一片"" for Chaoyang, etc.). These are not official administrative boundaries but social/cultural categorizations that people use to distinguish local identity or area characteristics.
- The author does not mention administrative divisions or hukou, so RL2 is not applicable.
- No mention of family roots or generational history, so RL3 is not applicable.
- No mention of dialect or language features, so RL4 is not applicable.
- Some mentions could hint at functional livability (e.g., ""环球"" in Tongzhou, ""学校"" in Fangshan, ""水库"" in Miyun, ""冬奥"" in Yanqing), but these are not explicitly linked to defining ""local person"" identity or the quality of ""local"" areas as per the task's requirement. They are more like brief notes or landmarks.
- No mention of social embeddedness or property ownership, so RL6 is not applicable.
- No mention of occupation or typification of residents, so RL7 is not applicable.

- 密云: 水库，滑雪教练漂亮  
- 房山: 周口店猿人遗址  
- 延庆: 八达岭长城 动物园

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic  
The text is a casual list of district names with associated landmarks, personal impressions, or stereotypes. The author does not explicitly or implicitly argue any of these features as a standard to define who is or is not a ""local person."" Instead, the text is more like a set of mental or emotional place associations, some geographic and cultural landmarks, and some personal experiences or impressions.

- There are some implicit emotional or cultural labels linked to areas (e.g., 通州“远离卷毛老太太”，平谷“口音好重”) that could be interpreted as vernacular spatial perceptions, but these are not clearly used by the author to define ""local person"" identity or who counts as local.

- The author mentions local landmarks and features (故宫, 八达岭长城, etc.) but does not say these define local identity.

- The mention of ""口音好重"" in 平谷 touches on dialect but not as a standard for local identity.

- There is no explicit or implicit statement that hukou, family roots, property, social embeddedness, or occupation are criteria for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results  
No recognition logic categories are clearly endorsed by the author as standards for defining ""local person"" identity or local area evaluation.

- 东城: mentions notable places like Dongzhimen, Yonghegong, Chaowai SOHO with a questioning tone on Chaowai SOHO.
- 西城: mentions areas like Anzhen, Anhui, Jimenqiao, Nanlishilu.
- 海淀: mentions famous universities (Tsinghua, Peking University), Zhongguancun, Wudaokou; also ""programmers' gathering place.""
- 朝阳: mentions ""Jingye,"" ""Siheyuan,"" ""under the city root,"" ""prosperous metropolis.""

- 门头沟: ""in the mountains? Quite remote,"" ""people there are fierce, hard to bully.""
- 房山: ""too remote,"" ""feels like almost out of Beijing,"" ""houses relatively cheap.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint:

- The author divides Beijing into districts and associates each with a set of characteristics. The distinctions are made based on:
  - Spatial and symbolic attributes of districts (e.g., ""prosperous metropolis"" for Chaoyang, ""a bit remote"" or ""dilapidated"" for Fengtai, ""mountainous"" for Mentougou).
  - The presence of famous institutions or social groups (""programmers' gathering place"" in Haidian).
  - Social composition (""migrant workers"" in Fengtai).
  - Emotional or cultural impressions (""people there are fierce"" in Mentougou).

This indicates a logic of **RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority** because the author is using a shared local perception of the city’s intra-urban spatial categories and symbolic meanings to distinguish local areas.

Also, the mention of social composition and occupational groups (""migrant workers"" in Fengtai, ""programmers"" in Haidian) suggests some degree of **RL7 Occupational Typification** because the author associates districts with certain occupational/social groups.

No explicit mention of administrative boundaries or hukou, so no RL2.

No mention of family roots or generational ties (RL3).

No mention of dialects or language (RL4).

No direct mention of livability features like transit or amenities, although ""undeveloped"" and ""a bit dilapidated"" could be borderline RL5, but the author does not explicitly link these to defining ""local person"" identity, rather describing the place conditions.

No mention of property ownership or social embeddedness (RL6).

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 东城、西城: mentions ""崇文 东城合并 城里人"" and ""宣武 西城合并 城里人"" — indicating merged administrative districts and the term ""城里人"" (urban people).
- 海淀: ""大学很多"" (many universities), ""那边的父母鸡娃挺多的"" (parents there push kids hard).
- 朝阳: ""感觉很有钱的样子"" (feels wealthy).
- 丰台: ""家"" (home), ""以前是郊区"" (was suburban), ""附近有城里拆迁过来的"" (nearby people relocated from city demolition), ""没啥好工作，上班地铁好多人"" (not many good jobs, many people take the subway to work).

- 平谷: ""大桃"" (big peaches), ""有地方口音"" (has local accent).
- 密云: ""水库"" (reservoir).
- 延庆: ""山区"" (mountain area).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- 东城、西城: The mention of ""崇文 东城合并"" and ""宣武 西城合并"" refers to administrative mergers, and ""城里人"" (urban people) suggests a distinction based on administrative or urban residency status. This fits RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) because the author notes administrative changes as defining local urban identity.

- 丰台: ""以前是郊区"" (used to be suburban) and ""附近有城里拆迁过来的"" (people relocated from city demolitions), ""没啥好工作，上班地铁好多人"" (working conditions) — this is more description of social status and living conditions but the phrase ""家"" (home) implies a personal rootedness or family connection. The mention of ""家"" may hint at family rootedness (RL3), but it's not explicit or detailed. The description of work and commuting relates more to functional livability but does not explicitly define local identity. The phrase ""附近有城里拆迁过来的"" implies locals versus relocated people, possibly hinting at family rootedness or social embeddedness, but this is not clearly used by the author as a standard to define local identity. So no clear RL3 or RL6.

- 海淀: ""大学很多,"" ""那边的父母鸡娃挺多的"" — this is descriptive of the area and social habits, not about defining local identity.

- 朝阳: ""感觉很有钱的样子"" — wealth perception, no explicit link to defining local identity.

- 石景山: ""首钢,"" ""之前公司的客服部去那边打过电话,"" ""感觉玉渊潭在石景山"" — these are spatial perceptions, especially the last one about Yuyuantan being felt as part of Shijingshan, which is a subjective spatial cognition. This suggests a vernacular spatial perception about area boundaries, fitting RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- 门头沟、房山、通州, 顺义, 昌平, 大兴, 怀柔, 平谷, 密云, 延庆: Mostly descriptions of geographical features, local products, or landmarks, some mention of local accent at 平谷 (""有地方口音""). The mention of ""有地方口音"" (has local accent) at Pinggu is a direct linguistic-cultural marker used to define local distinctiveness, fitting RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

- 房山: ""周口店北京人本人"" (Zhoukoudian Beijing person himself) — this could be a claim of family rootedness or local identity based on being a Beijing person from that area. It implies RL3 (Family Rootedness).

Summary of applicable RL categories:
- RL1: Stone Mountain (石景山) subjective spatial perception of Yuyuantan.
- RL2: East and West City administrative mergers and ""urban people"" identification.
- RL3: Fangshan (房山) ""北京人本人"" suggesting family rootedness.
- RL4: Pinggu (平谷) ""有地方口音"" local accent.

No clear evidence for RL5, RL6, RL7 as defining local identity standards by the author.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The old man says the original core urban districts (城八区) such as 东城, 西城, 崇文, 宣武 are considered ""城里"" (city proper), while 朝阳, 海淀, 丰台, 石景山 are ""近郊"" (near suburbs).
- The far suburbs were incorporated later and considered ""far away,"" people generally say ""go to Beijing"" rather than ""go to the city"" when referring to these.
- The author provides historical administrative changes showing how the city expanded and incorporated more districts over time.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The old man's classification of which districts are considered ""city proper"" (城里) versus suburbs (近郊) reflects a shared habitual local perception and symbolic spatial categorization, i.e., Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1).
- The author’s mention of historical administrative changes (district mergers, incorporations) is descriptive and factual but not necessarily used by the author to define ""local person"" identity or to evaluate ""local area"" identity from their own perspective. The author does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The old man's distinction about the city core and suburbs is based on collective emotional map and common societal views, not official administrative lines.
- No mention of family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as defining ""local person"" identity in the author's argument.

Step 2: The author claims 房山 is historically part of Beijing, citing 《房山县志》 (Fangshan county annals) as proof. The author explains 延庆 has a heavy accent because it came from 河北, implying that 延庆 is not originally part of Beijing but was temporarily administered by 河北, then returned to Beijing. The author emphasizes the historical administrative changes and the origins of these districts.

Step 3: Recognition Logic analysis:
- The author uses historical administrative boundaries and changes to argue about the origins and legitimacy of local identity (延庆 temporarily managed by 河北 but originally Beijing, 房山 historically Beijing). This aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The mention of 延庆口音重 (heavy accent) because it came from 河北, contrasting with other districts that are ""北京固有"" (originally Beijing), indicates a linguistic-cultural distinction used to define local identity. This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author also appeals to historical records and the temporal administrative changes to justify local identity, which can be interpreted as Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1), because the author is discussing which areas ""count"" as local based on historical and collective perceptions.

Step 2: The author argues that all 16 districts of Beijing are important and should be considered part of Beijing. They reject the idea that areas outside the Third Ring Road are just farmland (an outdated view). They emphasize the inclusion of both the six central urban districts and the ten suburban districts as integral parts of Beijing.

Step 3: The author’s logic is based on spatial definition of the city and local identity, emphasizing inclusion of all administrative districts as constituting ""Beijing."" They mention specific districts and ring roads, highlighting the spatial scope of the city.

Step 4: The author’s logic aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because they discuss which spatial areas count as part of Beijing and emphasize their importance as part of the city identity, rejecting outdated emotional maps that exclude outer areas.

The mention of districts and ring roads relates to spatial perceptions of the city but also could be linked to administrative divisions. However, the author does not explicitly base their argument on administrative legitimacy or hukou, but on the spatial and cultural importance of all districts.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author discusses Beijing's historical administrative changes, emphasizing that current Beijing started from the Ming Dynasty, not Jin Kingdom.
- The author points out that during the Republic of China (民国), Beijing was gradually separated and parts were given to Hebei.
- The author notes that Beijing was directly governed again only after the founding of the People's Republic of China, with boundaries stabilizing by 1958.
- The author disputes any relevance of Jin Kingdom to current Beijing identity or boundaries.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author uses official historical administrative changes and jurisdictional boundaries to define what counts as Beijing and its identity.
- The repeated mention of administrative changes, jurisdiction shifts, and boundary adjustments supports the use of administrative legitimacy to define local identity.
- There is no mention of dialect, family roots, social embeddedness, or other logics.
- The author rejects older historical eras (Jin Kingdom) as irrelevant for defining current Beijing.

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author describes how the city was perceived in their childhood: East-West City was considered the core Beijing city, Chongwen and Xuanwu were seen as rundown urban areas, Chaohai Feng was near suburbs, and other areas were far suburban counties. The second ring road was considered the boundary between urban and rural areas, and the third ring road was considered wasteland.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author is describing the local perception of spatial categories and their symbolic meanings (e.g., 二环 as urban-rural boundary, 三环 as wasteland).
- These are not official administrative boundaries but collective emotional maps or habitual local spatial cognition.
- This fits Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- 郊区 (suburbs)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author discusses how in childhood, the area inside Dongxi Cheng and Tiananmen was called ""inside Beijing city,"" and areas outside were called ""suburbs."" This reflects a spatial classification of the city into core and periphery, indicating a shared local perception of urban boundaries.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The author refers to a local, vernacular way of defining ""inside Beijing"" vs. ""suburbs,"" which is based on collective spatial cognition rather than official administrative boundaries. This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

- 东边: ""小时候总觉得城里方便"" (childhood thought city was convenient), ""年纪越大越不爱回东边了"" (less and less willing to return to East side as getting older).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- For 门头沟, the author states locals are the majority, implying a local identity tied to the actual demographic composition. This suggests RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author perceives 门头沟 as a core local area based on social recognition of locals living there.
- The author evaluates the livability and environment of 门头沟 (""生活挺惬意"", ""环境好"") as part of the local area’s quality, which is RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of ""本地人占大部份"" could also relate to RL6 (Social Embeddedness) as the author notes the social composition and implicitly the embeddedness of locals.
- For 东边, the author contrasts convenience in childhood with current unwillingness to return, indicating a shift in spatial preference or perceived livability, again linked to RL5.

Step 2: The author argues that the concept of ""going to Beijing"" is historically tied to the core urban area (""北京城"") and related historical city areas (""京兆地区,"" ""天子脚下,"" ""长城内""). The author emphasizes the importance of historical city boundaries and traditional linguistic usage (""北京城,"" ""密云城"") in defining what counts as ""Beijing.""

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses historical and habitual local perceptions about spatial boundaries and place names to define what counts as ""Beijing"" or local area.
- The emphasis on ""京兆地区,"" ""天子脚下,"" and the awkwardness of saying ""去密云城"" in local language reflects vernacular spatial authority.
- The discussion centers on culturally sedimented local perceptions rather than official administrative boundaries.

房山柿子不行，房山最大的特产是跨区打工人,Recognition Logic 7,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 房山 (Fangshan)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""房山柿子不行"" (Fangshan persimmons are not good)
- ""房山最大的特产是跨区打工人"" (Fangshan's biggest specialty is cross-district migrant workers)

Step 3: Analysis of recognition logic:
- The author comments on the quality of a local product (柿子) but this is about product quality, not about defining ""local person"" identity.
- The phrase ""跨区打工人"" (cross-district migrant workers) associates Fangshan with a certain occupational group.
- By stating the biggest ""specialty"" of Fangshan is migrant workers, the author implicitly identifies Fangshan's local identity or resident composition through occupational typification.
- This aligns with Recognition Logic 7 (Occupational Typification), as the author uses the dominant occupational group to characterize the local identity.

- 西北二环外
- 西直门
- 金融街西单
- 王府井金宝街
- 崇文门
- 望京

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 西北二环外: The author lives a few hundred meters outside the Northwest Second Ring Road; it's very quiet at night, few people around.
- 西直门, 金融街西单, 王府井金宝街: Places where the author or family members go to eat or shop, implying these are more lively or resource-rich areas.
- 崇文门: Where the author's aunt lives.
- 望京: Where the author used to work; fewer shops than there, wholesale markets have closed, small unregulated shops closed; basic living is fine but shopping and entertainment are lacking.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The author describes the livability and convenience of areas (quietness, availability of shops, markets, entertainment). This relates to the material infrastructure and functional living environment.
- The author does not discuss administrative boundaries or hukou status.
- There is no mention of family roots or length of residence as a defining criterion.
- No mention of dialect or linguistic-cultural markers.
- No mention of social embeddedness like property ownership or social networks.
- No mention of occupational typification.
- The author implies a contrast in convenience and livability between areas, but does not explicitly say that this is a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The author describes living conditions and area characteristics but does not explicitly or implicitly claim these as standards for judging who is a local person.
- The author mentions ""I live here,"" but does not link this to ""local person"" identity explicitly or implicitly.

Step 4: Determine if any RL applies as standard for defining ""local person"" identity.

- The text is mainly about livability and convenience of different areas, not about standards for ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly use these to define who is or is not a local person.
- Therefore, no RL categories apply.

你公公纯老北京的话他们的意识里二环内才是北京三环就是郊区了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 
- 二环内 (inside the Second Ring Road)
- 三环 (Third Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that in the consciousness of ""pure old Beijing"" (their father-in-law), only the area inside the Second Ring Road counts as Beijing proper, while the Third Ring Road is considered suburban.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is conveying a vernacular spatial authority logic: defining local identity based on traditional, habitual spatial boundaries within the city (inside 2nd ring vs. 3rd ring).
- This is not about administrative boundaries but about local perception of core vs. suburban areas.

- 北京 (Beijing)

Step 2: Match arguments to named entities:
- The author describes their personal experience living in Beijing for 5-6 years, initially not liking it but gradually growing to like it.
- The author recounts an incident where elderly locals (""北京大爷大妈"") proactively gave up their seats for the author's disabled father on the subway.
- The author expresses gratitude for this behavior.
- The author contrasts this with younger people, who rarely give up seats, possibly due to work stress.
- The story implies a perception of local people (specifically elderly Beijing residents) as caring and socially responsible, which the author appreciates.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implicitly recognizes ""locals"" as those who behave in certain socially responsible ways (e.g., giving up seats for disabled persons).
- The mention of ""北京大爷大妈"" (Beijing elderly) as the ones who give up seats indicates a social/cultural behavioral standard tied to local identity.
- This is not about administrative status or family roots or dialect, but about culturally shared social behavior patterns.
- This fits RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) in a broader sense of cultural behavioral recognition, though dialect is not mentioned explicitly, the local elderly's behavior is a cultural marker.
- Also, the author is implicitly using the social behavior of these elderly as a standard for defining who is ""local"" or at least a ""good local"" in Beijing.
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, or property.
- The focus is on social/cultural behavior and recognition.

北京地铁对坐轮椅的、盲人全程服务特别好,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 北京地铁 (Beijing subway)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The text mentions that Beijing subway provides very good service to wheelchair users and blind people.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The text focuses on service quality and accessibility features of the subway.
- It does not mention or imply any criteria about defining ""local person"" identity.
- It does not discuss any spatial boundaries, administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or any such standards related to ""local person.""
- The mention of service quality or livability could relate to RL5 (Functional Livability), but only if the author uses it as a criterion for defining ""local person"" or evaluating ""local"" areas in terms of identity.
- Here, the text only praises the service for certain groups but does not relate this to local identity definition.
- Therefore, no recognition logic related to ""local person"" identity is expressed.

- 东边: The author says they grew up there, implying familiarity and a sense of local rootedness.
- 西边: The author is unfamiliar with it.
- 北展: The author visited recently and felt it is more old-fashioned compared to 东边.
- 仙踪林: A chain store brand that used to be in the old city center; the author notes it still exists.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes growing up in 东边 and contrasts it with other areas (西边, 北展), implying that being ""local"" relates to where one grew up or spent childhood. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The description of 北展 as ""old-fashioned"" compared to 东边 and mention of 老城区中心位置 relates to a vernacular spatial understanding of city areas, reflecting a shared local perception of area identity, i.e., RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of the chain store 仙踪林 being in the old city center and the nostalgic recognition also supports RL1, as it ties to local historical spatial identity.

开车都要这么久……那要是坐地铁不更远……是不是经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便啊，以后也发展不起来了吗,RL5,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 延庆 (Yanqing), 市区 (urban area/downtown)

Step 2: The author discusses the commuting time from 延庆 to the city center (市区), implying inconvenience for those living in 延庆 but working in the city center.

Step 3: The author implies that living in 延庆 is inconvenient for people working in the city center because of the long commute, whether by car or subway. This relates to the functional convenience and livability of the area, i.e., RL5. The author wonders if 延庆 will develop in the future, suggesting that the area's livability and convenience standards affect its development and possibly its ""local"" status or desirability.

Step 4: The author does not mention administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification. The focus is on the functional livability and convenience of the area.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- 延庆没有地铁只有长途公交，坐车的话3h打底了。
- 在市区工作一定不要住延庆啊。

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the transportation convenience and commuting time (lack of subway, long bus ride, 3 hours minimum).
- The author advises against living in 延庆 if working in the city center due to transportation inconvenience.
- This is an evaluation of livability and convenience of living functions.
- The author does not explicitly say 延庆 residents are not local or define local identity by this, but implicitly uses the functional livability standard to evaluate 延庆 as a place not suitable for locals working in the city.
- Since the author uses livability and functional convenience as a standard to judge the desirability of living in 延庆, this corresponds to RL5.

- 西边: The west side is described as ""a bit rustic"" but low-key, and looks down on Chaoyang.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses social relations centered in Cuiwei, indicating social embeddedness and local social circles.
- The mention of ""民营经济主导"" (private economy dominated) and being looked down upon by the west side suggests a social or class distinction linked to economic or occupational composition.
- The author does not explicitly use administrative boundaries or family rootedness.
- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic features.
- No mention of infrastructure or livability features.
- The contrast between Chaoyang and West side includes social status and economic composition, which relates to social embeddedness (RL6) and occupational typification (RL7).

- 西城: mentioned together with 海淀 regarding property value.
- 朝阳: ""朝阳很多盘跌的稀碎"" refers to property depreciation; ""朝阳能买3.500平的明星小区"" mentions housing size and prestige.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- ""几代人都在海淀"" directly relates to family rootedness (RL3).
- ""优质房产保值度高"" and discussion of property price trends relate to social embeddedness via property ownership and economic status (RL6).
- No mention of administrative legitimacy or dialect or vernacular spatial authority or occupational typification or livability convenience as a defining standard.

Step 2: The author describes their living location (East Second Ring), parents' living location (East Fourth Ring), and workplace (West Fourth Ring). They feel going to work is like ""going abroad,"" especially with traffic controls likened to customs checks.

Step 3: The author implies a spatial boundary between East and West ring roads, with the West Fourth Ring area feeling foreign or outside their local identity. This suggests a vernacular spatial authority logic, where local identity is defined by intra-city spatial perceptions and boundaries.

No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification related to defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- 内片房价低 (Inner area has low housing prices)
- 房价低容易滋生垃圾 (Low housing prices lead to garbage problems)

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author talks about housing prices and the consequence of low prices causing garbage issues.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly say that housing price or environmental quality defines who is a ""local person"" or the local identity.
- The mention of low housing price and garbage is an evaluation of living conditions but not explicitly linked to ""local person"" identity or defining local areas.
- Therefore, no RL category applies here because the text does not use these factors to define local identity.

- 通州 (Tongzhou)
- 通县 (Tong County)
- 顺义 (Shunyi)
- 延庆 (Yanqing)
- 西直门 (Xizhimen)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author, as a native Beijing local, expresses an old-fashioned view that areas beyond certain landmarks or administrative boundaries are considered ""countryside"" (rural), i.e., not part of the urban core or ""local"" urban area. For example:
- East beyond Dongdaqiao = countryside
- West beyond Guanyuan = countryside
- North beyond North Third Ring Road = countryside
- South beyond Natural History Museum = countryside
- Haidian beyond Zhongguancun towards northwest = countryside
- Fengtai was formerly considered suburban with special calling charges
- Tongzhou, Shunyi, Yanqing are mentioned as far places, implying a sense of being outside the urban core

This reflects a vernacular, habitual, spatial perception of the city boundaries and which areas count as ""urban"" or ""local"" versus ""rural.""

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
The author uses a **vernacular spatial authority** logic (RL1) to define ""local"" identity, based on collective, habitual, and emotional maps of the city, rather than official administrative boundaries. The repeated references to areas beyond ring roads or landmarks being ""countryside"" shows a spatial classification standard rooted in local perceptions.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author explains that the term ""东富西贵"" in old Beijing dialect refers specifically to areas inside the 2nd Ring Road, particularly inside the subway line 2.
- The author states that Chaoyang district was rural at that time and is not included in the scope referred to by the old saying.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author is using historical and vernacular local spatial perceptions to define what counts as the ""core local area"" in Beijing, excluding Chaoyang.
- This corresponds to RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author refers to collective local perceptions and historical labels rather than official administrative boundaries.

正解，老辈区的概念不强的，因为那个时候变化太多，可能他经历了好几次行政区的划分调动，所以基本上本地人只会说自己待的这个地方的地名，比如凤山门望江门四牌楼庆春孩儿巷武林门半道红卖鱼桥古荡三里亭这种，也就是现在的街道（镇）、小区（村）的概念，只有对外地的朋友，他不清楚这些地方的所以才会用区来表述。,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 凤山门
- 望江门

- 庆春
- 孩儿巷
- 武林门
- 半道红
- 卖鱼桥
- 古荡
- 三里亭
- 街道（镇）
- 小区（村）
- 老辈区

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author argues that the concept of 老辈区 (older generation districts) is not strong because of frequent administrative boundary changes. Locals identify themselves by specific place names like those listed (凤山门, 望江门, etc.), which correspond to current streets, towns, or villages rather than broader administrative districts. They only use district names when talking to outsiders who may not understand the local place names.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes local people use habitual, historically sedimented local place names (vernacular spatial categories) rather than official administrative divisions to identify their local area.
- The author points out that administrative boundaries changed frequently, making administrative divisions less meaningful for local identity.
- The focus is on the shared, habitual use of local place names as a cultural shorthand to define local belonging.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- 老余杭 (Old Yuhang)  
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)  
- 市区 (urban area/downtown area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- The author describes a situation where local people from the urban area of Hangzhou criticize them for claiming to be from Hangzhou when they are from Yuhang (an outer district or suburban area). The criticism is that without having a house in the urban area, one should not claim to be a Hangzhou person.  
- The author then says they understand this logic and only claim to be from the Hangzhou suburbs or specifically ""Old Yuhang.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The criticism is based on the spatial distinction between the urban core (市区) and the suburban/outlying area (余杭), and the idea that only people with a house in the urban area can be called Hangzhou locals.  
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1), where local people use habitual, emotional, or cultural maps (urban vs suburban) to define local identity, not just administrative boundaries.  
- The mention of ""没有房子"" (no house) in the urban area is linked to property ownership, but the author does not explicitly endorse this as a standard for defining local identity; it is the locals' criticism, and the author just understands it. The author only adopts the spatial distinction, not the property ownership standard. So RL6 is not endorsed.  
- The author self-identifies as ""杭州郊区"" or ""老余杭,"" which indicates acceptance of the local spatial boundary logic (RL1).  
- No mention of hukou or administrative divisions (RL2).  
- No mention of family rootedness (RL3).  
- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic features (RL4).  
- No mention of livability or amenities (RL5).  
- No mention of occupational typification (RL7).

- The author identifies as from 余杭.  
- The author notes that people say ""go to 杭州"" rather than ""go to 市区.""  
- The author expresses a lack of belonging and that others do not treat them as ""one of their own.""  
Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:  
- The distinction between 余杭 and 杭州市区 indicates a vernacular spatial boundary (RL1) — the author recognizes that 余杭 is perceived as outside the core ""local"" urban area (市区), which affects local identity and belonging.  
- The sense of ""not being considered one of us"" aligns with RL1, reflecting a shared emotional map of insider vs outsider based on intra-city spatial categories.  
- There is no explicit administrative boundary claim (RL2), no mention of family roots (RL3), dialect (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).

Step 3: The author implicitly rejects the logic that administrative status (hukou) or family occupational background defines ""乡下"" identity, but does not explicitly endorse any standard. The author questions the legitimacy of defining countryside based on hukou or family background but does not offer an alternative definition.

Therefore, the author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse any recognition logic category for defining ""local person"" or ""乡下.""

- 杭州 (Hangzhou)
- 余杭 (Yuhang)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 杭州: The author says that going to a ""破大学"" (poor university) in Hangzhou results in being discriminated against as ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin).
- 余杭: The author says studying 12 years in Yuhang did not cause any problems; no discrimination.

The author also complains about being told they have no sense of belonging and being called ""乡下人"" by people from Hangzhou, who consider themselves ""老底子杭州"" (old genuine Hangzhou residents). Hangzhou is described as a small place that has developed by absorbing other areas.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes between ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin) and presumably ""local"" urban residents.
- The discrimination seems based on the place of study and possibly origin.
- The author contrasts ""老底子杭州"" (old genuine Hangzhou) versus others who are ""乡下人.""
- This suggests the author acknowledges or implicitly agrees with a spatial-cultural hierarchy or recognition logic based on local origin and historic belonging to the city proper.
- The author references ""老底子杭州"" as a marker of being a ""true local,"" and the sense of being discriminated against for coming from outside the core area or a less prestigious area.
- This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), where local identity is tied to historically sedimented spatial perceptions (old core Hangzhou vs. other districts).
- The mention of ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin) also involves a cultural-linguistic or social identity boundary, but the main point is spatial and origin-based.
- There is no explicit mention of hukou or administrative divisions (RL2).
- No explicit mention of family roots or generations (RL3).
- No explicit mention of dialect or accent (RL4).
- No mention of livability or infrastructure (RL5).
- No mention of property or social embeddedness (RL6).
- No mention of occupation (RL7).

- 杭州
- 武林门
- 采荷
- 翠苑
- 朝晖
- 老市区范围的杭州话

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions that being able to correctly answer specific place names within Hangzhou (武林门, 采荷, 翠苑, 朝晖) acts as a sort of ""password"" that triggers a switch to speaking the local Hangzhou dialect, specifically the old city area dialect.
- The author implies that the local dialect spoken varies with spatial distance, as even a few kilometers cause accent differences.
- This suggests that knowledge of specific local place names and the ability to speak the local dialect are standards or recognition logics for defining who is a ""local person.""

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of specific place names within the city and the importance of them as a ""password"" reflects RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority. The author recognizes certain local spatial categories (specific neighborhoods or areas) as markers of local identity.
- The emphasis on speaking the local dialect, especially the old city area dialect, and noting accent differences, aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, as dialect/accent is used to judge local authenticity.

- 西湖区三墩
- 浙大紫金港
- 龙翔桥
- 杭州
- 三墩乡下人

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author states that although they are from 西湖区三墩 and 浙大紫金港, when going to 龙翔桥, they say they are going to 杭州.
- The author also mentions that externally they say they are 三墩乡下人.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies that going beyond a certain spatial boundary (龙翔桥) is considered going to 杭州 proper, indicating a habitual local perception of spatial categories.
- The author identifies with the label ""三墩乡下人,"" indicating a local spatial classification within the city that carries symbolic meaning (乡下人 meaning countryside person).
- This reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses common local spatial distinctions and symbolic labels to define local identity.

不一定因为杭州市区的瞧不起周边的又因为杭州政府做的不地道很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感，问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 杭州市区 (Hangzhou urban area)  
- 周边 (surrounding areas)  
- 杭州政府 (Hangzhou government)  
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 杭州市区瞧不起周边：The urban area looks down on the surrounding areas.  
- 很多区的人对杭州没有归属感：Many people from various districts lack a sense of belonging to Hangzhou.  
- 问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了：When asking where you are from, it’s just asking where you yourself feel you belong.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The author points out that official or external attitudes (such as urban area looking down on surroundings or government actions) cause lack of belonging, but the key criterion for ""where you are from"" is subjective self-identification (""where you feel you are from"").  
- The author emphasizes personal subjective feeling of identity rather than administrative boundaries or official recognition.  
- This is a critique of external or administrative standards and a promotion of self-defined identity.  
- No mention of family roots, dialect, property, occupation, or other concrete standards.  
- The key logic is a subjective, personal, internal definition of local identity, which does not exactly match RL1-RL7 as defined (all focus on external or collective standards). However, RL1 includes ""shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions"" but here the author rejects these imposed perceptions and instead stresses self-perception.  
- Among the RLs, the closest is RL1 (vernacular spatial authority) because the author is discussing the spatial identity and boundaries of Hangzhou and surrounding areas, but the author rejects the imposed spatial hierarchy and favors personal self-identification.  
- Since the author uses ""where you feel you are from"" as the defining standard, this can be interpreted as a subjective spatial identity logic related to vernacular spatial authority but with a twist: the author rejects imposed spatial categories and promotes personal recognition.  
- The author does not rely on administrative legitimacy (RL2), family roots (RL3), dialect (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).  
- Given the task constraints, the author is implicitly endorsing a subjective, personal standard of local identity related to spatial identity but rejecting official or collective spatial authority.  
- Since no explicit RL category perfectly fits subjective self-identification alone, but the closest is RL1 because it deals with spatial identity and urban area scope, and the author is discussing these concepts and their legitimacy.  
- Therefore, the output is RL1.  

Step 4: Output the results

Step 2: The author says they are from 三墩镇 in 西湖区 and calls themselves a ""杭州乡下人"" (rural person of Hangzhou), and mentions that when talking to ""城里人"" (city people), the way of speaking is different.

Step 3: The author uses the distinction between ""乡下人"" and ""城里人"" based on the place of origin within the city area (三墩镇 vs. city proper) and implies a difference in identity or speech patterns. This suggests a vernacular spatial authority logic, defining ""local"" identity based on intra-city spatial categories and social perceptions (rural vs. urban within the city).

Also, the mention of different ways of speaking suggests a linguistic-cultural recognition logic, using dialect or speech differences to mark local identity.

Step 4: Output RL1 and RL4.

- 城里的 (urban people) look down on ""us"" from the countryside.
- 西湖区 is described as a ""countryside place,"" speaking the ""old Yuhang dialect.""
- 城里 people speak Hangzhou dialect, which differs from the dialect spoken in 西湖区.
- There is a perceived difference between ""us"" (from 西湖区) and ""them"" (from the urban area) based on dialect and spatial identity.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author implies a local identity distinction based on dialect differences (RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author also implies a spatial distinction between urban and countryside areas, using the label ""乡下地方"" (countryside place) for 西湖区, which reflects a vernacular spatial perception of the area (RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- The author says ""我是富阳的，以前是独立的市，前几年才划进杭州的"" (""I am from Fuyang, which used to be an independent city and was only incorporated into Hangzhou a few years ago"").
- This indicates the author uses administrative division (incorporation into Hangzhou) as a basis for defining local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the administrative change of Fuyang from an independent city to being part of Hangzhou.
- This is an appeal to administrative legitimacy to define local identity.

- 滨江 (Binjiang)
- 萧山 (Xiaoshan)
- 市区 (city center)
- 七堡 (Qibao)
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author discusses local people's perception of what counts as ""市中心"" (city center) and what areas are considered local or not.
- The author says local people from Binjiang and Xiaoshan say when they go to the city center, they say ""go to Hangzhou to play,"" and that areas east up to Qibao are considered.
- The author’s classmates do not consider Qibao as city center.
- The author suggests that the way the city boundary is drawn (划) includes their own home area, implying that local people use an emotional or habitual spatial perception to define what is ""local"" or ""city center.""

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes local people's habitual or emotional perception of city boundaries, not official administrative boundaries.
- This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): local shared perceptions of intra-city spatial categories and emotional mapping.
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- The argument centers on collective emotional maps and recognition of ""city center"" status.

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 解放路 (Jiefang Road)
- 凤起路 (Fengqi Road)
- 庆春路 (Qingchun Road)
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author describes a local person (a former colleague) who was born and raised in Hangzhou and only recognizes these three roads (解放路, 凤起路, 庆春路). The author points out that this person is a ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (native local person born and raised in Hangzhou).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The author uses the fact that the person was ""born and raised locally"" and has a family residence and current residence in specific local roads to support the identity as a local person. The focus is on family roots and personal growth history in the city. The mention of only recognizing these roads suggests a local spatial awareness but mainly highlights the family rootedness and growth history.

Therefore, the recognition logic involved is RL3 (Family Rootedness).

Step 4: Output the results.

Step 2: The author expresses a desire that since the boundary has been extended to include 萧山, it should also include 大塘栖 to let them experience living in the ""市区"" (urban area). This implies the author is discussing the scope of what counts as the urban area or local area.

Step 3: The author is implicitly discussing the spatial boundary of the urban area and what areas ""count"" as local or urban. This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 4: Output the result.

杭州人至少要说杭州话，萧山话杭州人都听不懂，硬划进杭州市区，别说杭州人了，问问萧山人干吗？,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities: 杭州人, 萧山话, 杭州市区, 萧山人

Step 2: The author argues that to be a ""杭州人"" (Hangzhou person), one must at least speak the Hangzhou dialect. They mention that even ""萧山话"" (Xiaoshan dialect) is not understood by Hangzhou people, and that forcibly including Xiaoshan into Hangzhou city area does not make Xiaoshan people true Hangzhou people.

Step 3: The author uses dialect (language) as a core criterion for defining who is a true local. They also reject administrative boundary expansion as a criterion (""硬划进杭州市区"" - forcibly including Xiaoshan into Hangzhou city area), implying resistance to RL2. The emphasis is on dialect as a boundary marker for local identity.

Step 4: According to the Recognition Logic framework, this matches RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses dialect as a key identity criterion. Also, the mention of administrative boundary inclusion is negated (the author resists it), so RL2 is not endorsed.

"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。

- 番禺县新滘镇 (Panyu County Xinjiao Town)
- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 任嚣城 (Renxiao City)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:

- 广州城 vs 广州城区: The author discusses that historically and currently, the concept of ""Guangzhou city"" or ""Guangzhou urban area"" varies, and local people have a more restricted, historically grounded concept of the city center (the ""old four districts"") compared to outsiders.

- The ""old four districts"" (越秀，东山，荔湾，不含芳村，河南即海珠区南华东、同福西一带) are considered by local Guangzhou people as the core Guangzhou urban area.

- The author points out the difference between historical Guangzhou city (smaller, mainly the old Yuexiu district or old Panyu city) and current urban districts, noting that areas like Dongshan and Xiguan were once outside the city walls, and some areas now in Haizhu were formerly farmland.

- The author emphasizes the historical continuity of Guangzhou city starting from Qin and Han dynasty's ""Renxiao City"" (now Beijing Road area).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The author uses historical and local common sense spatial boundaries and perceptions to define what counts as ""Guangzhou city"" or ""Guangzhou urban area"" — a distinction between outsiders' broader perception and insiders' narrower, historically grounded perception.

- This reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): the author endorses a logic based on shared local perceptions and historical sedimentation of urban spatial boundaries, not just official administrative boundaries (e.g., the mention that Dongshan was merged into Yuexiu in 2005, the old four districts as the local notion of Guangzhou city).

- There is no explicit appeal to administrative legitimacy (RL2), although administrative divisions are mentioned, the focus is on local historical understanding, not administrative classification.

- There is no mention of family roots (RL3), linguistic-cultural criteria (RL4), livability factors (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as standards for defining local identity.

The text provides a historical administrative evolution of 花都 (Huadu), from ancient times (Han dynasty) to present, detailing its changing administrative status and jurisdictional affiliations.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The author focuses on the official administrative changes and jurisdictions governing 花都/花县 across different historical periods. This is an explicit appeal to administrative boundaries and legitimacy as the main criterion defining the area and its identity.

没错，大致就是东山还没并入的越秀区，还有一些后来并入的比如矿泉街道、桂花岗也不算进去,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 越秀区 (Yuexiu District)
- 矿泉街道 (Kuangquan Street)
- 桂花岗 (Guihuagang)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author states that Dongshan (still not merged into Yuexiu District), and some areas later merged such as Kuangquan Street and Guihuagang, are ""not counted in"" (presumably not counted as part of the core local area).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The author is discussing which spatial areas ""count"" as part of the local core or not, specifically mentioning areas that are or are not incorporated into Yuexiu District. This relates to defining local identity based on intra-city spatial boundaries and their recognition.

This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author is distinguishing local identity based on habitual or historically sedimented perceptions of which parts of the city ""count"" as local, beyond or regardless of formal administrative merger status.

Although the author mentions administrative mergers, the focus is on the local perception of what counts as local area, not strictly on legal administrative boundaries. The phrase ""还没并入的"" (not yet merged) is used to explain why Dongshan is excluded from the local area, but the core logic is about spatial recognition of local areas.

- The author mentions that the ""台山阿伯"" (Tai Shan uncle) entered the household registration in 大石 (Da Shi) area only in his teens, but still receives dividends.
- The author wonders how their family managed this.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author highlights household registration timing (""十几岁才入户大石那边"") as relevant to receiving dividends (""分红"").
- Receiving dividends is a form of community resource or economic benefit linked to local identity.
- The author implies that despite late household registration, the family still obtains local benefits.
- This relates to RL6: Social Embeddedness, because the dividends and household registration are tied to local social roots and economic status.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative legitimacy as a defining standard, just a description.
- No mention of dialect, occupation, or vernacular spatial authority.
- No explicit or implicit endorsement of hukou or administrative legitimacy as the defining standard, just a query about how the family got dividends.
- Since the author points out the dividends as a feature of local embeddedness, this aligns with RL6.

- The author states that speaking the local dialect (白话) is a key criterion for being considered a 广州人 (Guangzhou person).
- The husband is from Zhejiang but has studied and lived in Guangzhou for over 20 years and speaks standard 白话, so the author considers him 老广 (local Guangzhou person).
- The two sons were born and raised in Guangzhou but do not speak 白话; the author considers them ""Chinese"" but not necessarily local Guangzhou people.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses linguistic-cultural features (speaking the local dialect 白话) as a standard to define who is a local Guangzhou person.
- The author implicitly uses family rootedness and individual growth history (the husband’s long-term residence and education in Guangzhou) as a factor for local identity.
- The key focus is on dialect and cultural-linguistic recognition.

- The author mentions that at home, they used to speak the local dialect (""白话""), but after the two sons started nursery, they no longer speak the dialect, only understand it.
- This phenomenon is common among the author's Guangzhou friends.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author highlights the importance of speaking the local dialect (""白话"") as a marker of local identity.
- The decline in speaking the dialect among children is noted as a loss or problem.
- This directly relates to linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion for defining who is a local person.
- Therefore, the author implicitly endorses RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) as a standard for local identity.

- The author states that their family insists on speaking the local dialect (""白话"").
- The child does not speak the dialect very well but still the family insists on using it for communication.
- No one accommodates the child’s poor dialect, so communication remains in the dialect.

外地人大把会讲白话呀，特别是广西老表和湖南老表最多人,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广西老表 (people from Guangxi)
- 湖南老表 (people from Hunan)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author states that many outsiders speak the local dialect (""白话""), especially those from Guangxi and Hunan.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The mention that outsiders speak the local dialect (""白话"") implies that speaking the local dialect is a notable characteristic related to local identity. The author draws attention to language use (dialect) as a criterion or marker of local identity, implying that outsiders also speak the dialect, which is a key point in defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output the result:
Output: RL4"
我觉得唔紧要啊，起码人地真的学起来了，不是现在很多不友好的外地人，你一说白话，对方就一副妹仔大过主人婆的样子叫你讲普通话,RL4,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- No specific geographic entities are mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author complains about unfriendly ""outsiders"" who do not speak the local dialect (白话), implying that speaking the local dialect is a marker of being ""local"" or accepted as ""one of us.""

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author values the ability to speak the local dialect (白话) as a criterion to distinguish locals from outsiders.  
- The complaint about outsiders not speaking the local dialect and being rude implies the author endorses linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard to define local identity.

祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的，跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系。你逻辑都搞不清楚,RL3,"Step 1: Named Entities
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 祠堂 (ancestral hall)
- 陈家祠 (Chen Clan Ancestral Hall)

Step 2: Match Viewpoint Statements
- The author states that having your name in the ancestral hall (祠堂) is the fundamental criterion to be considered a Guangzhou person.
- The author rejects the idea that buying a ticket at Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is relevant to defining a Guangzhou person.
- The core argument is that family roots (ancestral lineage) represented by presence in the ancestral hall is the defining standard for being a local.

Step 3: Analyze Recognition Logic
- The author uses family historical roots as the key criterion for defining ""local person"" identity.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness.

Step 4: Output Result
Output: RL3"
陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,Recognition Logic 6,"Step 1: Identify named entities  
- 陈家祠 (Chen Family Ancestral Hall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The phrase ""陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦"" roughly means ""If Chen Family Ancestral Hall gives you dividends, then it concerns you; if not, then it doesn't."" This implies that being recognized as part of the local community is linked to whether one receives dividends (分红) from the ancestral hall.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- Receiving dividends from the ancestral hall implies having social embeddedness and economic ties within the local community. This is a material and symbolic marker of being a local person.  
- Therefore, the author implicitly agrees that local identity is partly based on social embeddedness and possession of local economic or symbolic resources.

- 家 (our family)
- 族谱 (genealogy records)
- 阿公阿婆 (grandparents)
- 阿爷和阿公 (grandfather and great-grandfather)
- 祠堂 (ancestral hall)
- 太公那代 (generation of great-grandfather)
- 先人祖坟 (ancestors' graves)
- 大宗族 (large clan)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author argues that their family stopped maintaining genealogies long ago.
- Most genealogies now are rebuilt after reforms by collective funding.
- The grandparents' side used to be landlords but severed relationships for survival.
- Even though the surname matches the large village clan, the ancestral hall is not theirs.
- Worshiping ancestors only goes back to the great-grandfather generation.
- The author rejects the idea that just having ancestors' graves or an ancestral hall means belonging to a large clan or having a genealogy.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is discussing the legitimacy of ""local person"" identity or belonging based on family roots, genealogy, and ancestral ties.
- They emphasize the importance of family lineage and historical roots (disputing or questioning claims based on genealogy and ancestral halls).
- The core argument revolves around family rootedness and generational ties.
- This aligns with Recognition Logic 3 (Family Rootedness).

- 南关 (Nanguan)
- 西关 (Xiguan)
- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 三元里 (Sanyuanli)
- 河南四区 (Henan four districts)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author defines the boundaries of Guangzhou city as extending west to Ximenkou, east to Dongshankou, north to Xiaobei, south to Nanguan, including Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, and Henan four districts.
- The author states that most villages that receive dividends are not part of Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly sets spatial boundaries of what counts as Guangzhou city, based on named areas, which is a shared local perception of city spatial categories rather than official administrative boundaries.
- The mention that most dividend-receiving villages are not Guangzhou implies a boundary of local identity excluding those areas.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author uses habitual local perceptions of spatial scope to define ""local"" Guangzhou.

其实是反过来的，村民以前在老广眼里是乡下人，只不过郊区城镇化之后村民平均生活水平比之前的老城区市民高，现在基本在广州会粤语都当你广州人，只不过有些人挑拨离间，广州人又要有祠堂分红又要在老三区，能满足这俩点的全广州找不出20万个，那还得了,RL4,"Step 1: Identify named entities:
- ""村民"" (villagers)
- ""老广"" (old Guangzhou locals)
- ""郊区"" (suburbs)
- ""广州"" (Guangzhou)
- ""老三区"" (old three districts)
- ""祠堂分红"" (ancestral hall dividends)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- ""村民"" were considered ""乡下人"" (country people) by ""老广"" before.
- After suburban urbanization, villagers' average living standards are higher than those of old urban residents.
- Now, in Guangzhou, anyone who can speak Cantonese is considered a Guangzhou local.
- Some people stir trouble, claiming that a Guangzhou person must have ancestral hall dividends and be from the old three districts.
- It is claimed that very few people (less than 200,000) can satisfy both conditions.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author endorses that speaking Cantonese (local dialect) is a key criterion for being considered a Guangzhou local -> RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The mention of ""祠堂分红"" (ancestral hall dividends) and ""老三区"" (old three districts) as standards some people use to define Guangzhou locals is presented as a viewpoint that the author disputes or views as unreasonable (""能满足这俩点的全广州找不出20万个，那还得了""). The author seems to reject this strict standard, so RL6 (Social Embeddedness) and RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) related to ""old three districts"" and ""ancestral hall dividends"" are mentioned but not endorsed.
- The author highlights that after suburban urbanization, villagers have higher living standards, but this is a descriptive statement about living standards, not about defining ""local person"" identity by livability or economic status, so RL5 is not endorsed.
- The text contrasts previous perceptions (villagers as country people) with current recognition based on Cantonese speaking, emphasizing linguistic-cultural recognition.

- 乡下 (countryside) 三水 (Sanshui)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions a classmate who is a villager from Chigang, and that this classmate says their hometown is Sanshui.
- The author expresses confusion about why some people think having dividends and ancestral halls means being a ""土著"" (indigenous local).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) and ""祠堂"" (ancestral halls) as criteria for being a ""土著"" reflects an evaluation based on family historical roots, lineage, and ancestral ties.
- The author questions this standard but does not explicitly oppose it; the author is reflecting on this standard as a recognized way people define ""local person"" identity.
- This corresponds to RL3: Family Rootedness.

Step 4: Output the result:

However, some people in the post say ""no ancestral hall, so not local"" (""冇祠堂就唔系""), implying ancestral hall presence is a criterion for local identity.
- 村: The author notes their village has no ancestral hall, and therefore the entire village might be considered non-local by others.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implicitly acknowledges family rootedness as a standard for local identity (""我屋企对上几代都系广州""), which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- Speaking Cantonese (""一直都系讲粤语"") is mentioned as a characteristic, which aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The mention of village dividends (""住村度有分红"") and community belonging implies social embeddedness or local social ties, fitting RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The mention of ancestral hall absence as a criterion others use but the author questions or finds it unreasonable. The author does not endorse this as a standard, so no annotation for that.
- The ID card prefix ""身份证4401"" is mentioned, but the author does not explicitly endorse this as a standard for local identity, just as a fact. So no RL2.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that within three generations counts as a ""real Guangzhou person,"" two generations as ""new Guangzhou person,"" first generation as ""Guangzhou immigrant,"" and those who do not speak Cantonese within three generations are considered outsiders.
- This classification is based on family generational depth and linguistic/cultural traits.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""三代以内,"" ""二代以内,"" ""一代,"" and ancestral lineage clearly matches RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention that ""三代都不讲广州话"" (three generations not speaking Cantonese) are outsiders strongly indicates RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

RL2 (administrative legitimacy) is mentioned but author implies resistance to it (father says you are local despite registration). The author’s core argument aligns with RL3 and RL4, i.e., growing up locally and speaking the local dialect define local identity.

Output: RL3, RL4","Step 1: Named entities:
- 广州天河 (Guangzhou Tianhe)
- 妈妈老家 (mother's hometown)
- 广州 (Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The father is from Guangzhou Tianhe (local).
- The mother’s hometown had dividends; the author’s household registration is with the mother, so the author is not considered Guangzhou local by administrative registration.
- Father insists the author is from Guangzhou.
- The author speaks fluent Cantonese and grew up in Guangzhou since childhood.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of household registration (户口) following the mother’s hometown and thus not being considered Guangzhou local is an administrative legitimacy logic (RL2).
- The father’s assertion ""you are from Guangzhou"" and the author grew up in Guangzhou since childhood, with fluent local dialect (粤语), indicates family rootedness (born and raised locally) and linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The fluent Cantonese and growing up in Guangzhou supports RL4 (linguistic-cultural recognition).
- Growing up in Guangzhou since childhood is a family rootedness/growth history standard (RL3).

Step 4: Output results:

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""如果户口是那就是啊 广州居民"" — The author uses hukou (household registration) as a standard for defining ""Guangzhou residents.""
- ""老广指村里有分红的"" — ""老广"" refers to people with village dividends; the author mentions this as a definition or category.
- ""新广就是买房定居广州"" — ""新广"" refers to people who bought a house and settled in Guangzhou.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- Using hukou as a criterion is RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.
- Referring to ""老广"" as those with village dividends implies local social embeddedness and property-based identity, which is RL6.
- Defining ""新广"" as those who bought a house and settled implies property ownership and social embeddedness, so RL6.

- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 三元里 (Sanyuanli)
- 河南四区 (Henan four districts)
- 分红的村 (dividend-paying villages)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that the Guangzhou city system is bounded by specific areas: west to Ximenkou, east to Dongshankou, north to Xiaobei, south to Nanguan, plus Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, and Henan four districts.
- The author also states that most dividend-paying villages are not Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author defines the scope of ""Guangzhou city"" by referencing specific spatial boundaries and local areas, indicating a shared local perception of what counts as Guangzhou. This is a classification based on habitual or historically sedimented local perceptions rather than official administrative boundaries.
- The mention that ""most dividend-paying villages are not Guangzhou"" implies that these villages are excluded from the local identity of Guangzhou, based on the local spatial classification.

This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

边个话你知老广就有分红，有分红都是村镇的，老广是住市区的,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 老广 (people from Guangzhou), 村镇 (villages and towns), 市区 (urban area)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that 老广 (locals from the city) do not have dividends (分红), dividends are for village/town residents.
- 老广 are described as living in the city area (市区).
- Implicitly, the author distinguishes 老广 (city locals) from villagers or townsfolk based on whether they receive dividends.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The argument distinguishes locals based on their social embeddedness in the city, specifically the possession of dividends (a form of community or property-based economic benefit). This links to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The author also distinguishes locals by their residential area: 老广 live in 市区 (urban area), while dividends are associated with 村镇 (villages and towns). This suggests an implicit spatial distinction but mainly to reinforce the economic embeddedness difference.
- The core standard the author endorses for defining 老广 identity is possession of dividends/community economic benefits, linked to social embeddedness.
- No mention of administrative hukou, family roots, dialect, occupational type, or livability convenience.
- The spatial aspect is mentioned but as a secondary point; the focus is on dividends.

我是爷爷南下干部过来的，虽然白话习惯都一样，但内心里没有归属感,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- ""爷爷南下干部"" (grandfather was a cadre who moved south)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author mentions that their grandfather was a cadre who moved south (implying family migration history).
- Despite sharing the same dialect (""白话习惯都一样"" - same Cantonese habits), the author feels a lack of belonging (""内心里没有归属感"").

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies that even though linguistic-cultural markers (dialect) are the same, the feeling of belonging is lacking due to family roots or generational history. The emphasis on grandfather moving south and lack of belonging suggests that family historical roots affect the author's identity as a local.
- The author does not endorse dialect alone as a sufficient standard.
- The core standard used by the author to define local person identity here is family rootedness (RL3).

Step 4: Output the results:
Output: RL3"
是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗，反正你又没分红,N/A,"Step 1: Identify named entities  
No specific named entities mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author questions whether there is any essential difference between locals and others, pointing out ""you don't get dividends anyway.""

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
The mention of ""dividends"" (分红) relates to community resources or material benefits that locals might enjoy, implying a recognition logic tied to social embeddedness and economic status. However, the author questions the significance of this distinction, seemingly downplaying or negating the importance of such a criterion.

Since the author is questioning whether the dividend difference matters and does not endorse this as a standard for defining locals, they do not use this logic to define ""local person"" identity. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any recognition logic for defining locals.

Step 4: Output the results  
No recognition logic is endorsed or implied by the author for defining ""local person"" identity.

- Mentions that Cantonese (a local dialect) is no longer widely spoken.
- Mentions that only villagers get dividends.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- Mentioning ""粤语都没人讲了"" (Cantonese is no longer spoken) implies the author acknowledges dialect as a marker of local identity. This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- Mentioning ""分红也只有村民有"" (only villagers get dividends) suggests economic/social embeddedness tied to local identity, which aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The author questions the importance of being local but does not deny these standards; the mention is neutral or implicit acceptance.

你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- No specific named entities are mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions ""分红"" (dividends/profits sharing) as a criterion: ""你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。""  
- This implies that having dividends (likely from property or community shares) is a standard for being considered local or truly embedded in the community.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) relates to ownership or benefit from community or property assets.  
- This fits Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status), as the author uses the presence or absence of dividends as a criterion for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results

- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 祠堂的本地村民 (local villagers with ancestral halls)
- 阿爷 (grandfather)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author self-identifies as a local ""土著"" (indigenous local) of Guangzhou, being the third generation born and raised there.
- The author’s identity concept is shaken when local villagers with ancestral halls claim he is not a ""土著.""
- The author notes that his grandfather only came to Guangzhou to work and settle, and the household registration (户口本) still shows a rural hometown, not Guangzhou.
- The author feels unable to refute this point.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author’s self-identification is based on being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) for three generations, implying RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The villagers’ challenge is based on ancestral lineage and household registration location, which also reflects RL3 (family historical roots) and RL2 (administrative legitimacy) since household registration is administrative.
- The author is affected by both RL3 (generational roots) and RL2 (hukou location).
- The main focus is on family roots and administrative registration as criteria for ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: The author states that in the past, Guangzhou city was small, and as long as one recognized Guangzhou culture and could speak Cantonese (广州话), they were considered Guangzhou people. The author rejects the idea that only those with dividends (分红) can be called Guangzhou people, noting that many urban Guangzhou people do not have dividends, and their ancestral homes are surrounding cities, but their families have lived in Guangzhou for three generations.

Step 3: Recognition Logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes recognizing Guangzhou people by their cultural recognition and speaking the local dialect (广州话) → RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author mentions ""三代在广州了"" (three generations in Guangzhou), indicating family rootedness as a criterion → RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author rejects the idea that only those with dividends (property or economic status) can be considered Guangzhou people, thus implicitly denying RL6 (Social Embeddedness), so RL6 is not annotated.
- The mention of ""广州文化"" (Guangzhou culture) as a criterion also supports RL4.
- The author does not emphasize administrative boundaries or spatial boundaries here, so RL1 and RL2 are not supported.
- No mention of livability or occupational typification.

- 广州: The author believes that as long as the hukou (户口) is in Guangzhou and one can speak Cantonese (白话) and has cultural identity, that person is a Guangzhou local.
- 茂名: The author's ancestral origin, but the family has almost no current connection and the author does not consider themselves a person from there.
- 番禺: Mentioned as a place where the author's grandfather studied and later worked, but the author states that Panyu's belonging is another topic, implying no explicit local identity argument here.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses hukou registration in Guangzhou as a key standard — matches RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author emphasizes speaking Cantonese (白话) and having cultural recognition — matches RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author mentions family roots and generational history (grandfather studied and worked in Panyu, family has no connection to Maoming) to argue local identity — matches RL3 (Family Rootedness).

- 广州 (Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions that their mother's side has been in Guangzhou for generations but lost land and status, becoming ""疍家人"" (a marginalized group), without land and village membership.
- The author's grandfather was born in Guangzhou.
- The author feels they are a Guangzhou person, but they have no dividends, no land, no house.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""世代广州人"" (generations in Guangzhou) and the grandfather born there suggests an endorsement of RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of no dividends, no land, no house is a description of property and economic status, but the author does not say these determine local identity; rather, the author feels local despite lacking these, so RL6 (Social Embeddedness) is mentioned but the author denies its legitimacy as a local identity criterion.
- The author questions whether their identity as a Guangzhou person is valid given the lack of property, implying that property and dividends are not sufficient criteria.
- The core standard the author endorses is the family rootedness (generational ties), not property or social embeddedness.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity: The author asks about the presence of ancestral halls, land, and dividends. These are symbols of property ownership, community embeddedness, and social roots.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic: The mention of ancestral halls, land, and dividends strongly relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as these are indicators of deep social roots, community belonging, and local fixed assets that signify local identity.

- 身份证 (ID card number 44010)
- 阿妈 (mother)
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 村 (village)
- 祖屋宅基地 (ancestral house and homestead land)
- 爬龙船 (dragon boat racing)
- 死股 (shares)
- 老豆 (father)
- 打啊爷工 (working as a laborer for grandfather)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that their ID card number is not 44010 because their mother is not from Guangzhou, so they need to ""enter the mother's place"" first, then the mother can sign over to Guangzhou.
- The author lives in a village, no dividends (shares).
- Father works as a laborer for grandfather and needs to convert to resident.
- Lives in ancestral house and homestead land.
- The village participates in dragon boat racing every year, sometimes playing the boat head flag position.
- Grandmother has shares (dead shares) that bring some money annually.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes family roots and ancestral residence (祖屋宅基地), participation in traditional village activities (爬龙船), and family inheritance (shares, dividends).
- The mother’s origin affects the legal or social status (ID card number, hukou).
- The ancestral house and village activities indicate a focus on family rootedness and cultural embeddedness.
- The mention of shares and dividends suggests social embeddedness and economic symbolism.
- The author is reflecting on the basis of being recognized as local, possibly implying that family origin, ancestral residence, and embeddedness in village social and economic structures are standards for local identity.

Step 4: Output the matched RL categories:
- Family Rootedness (RL3): Because of emphasis on mother’s origin, ancestral house, family lineage.
- Social Embeddedness (RL6): Because of shares, dividends, village social activities, and economic ties.
- Possibly Administrative Legitimacy (RL2): Because of mention of ID card number and mother’s place affecting legal status.

No mention or emphasis on linguistic-cultural recognition, vernacular spatial authority, livability, or occupational typification.

对啊我也想知道我们家在从化的村里有个几百年的祠堂，肯定算从化土著了。但是一几年并入广州之后身份证变了，不知道算不算广州土著。,"RL3, RL2","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 从化 (Conghua)
- 广州 (Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions their family has a several-hundred-year-old ancestral hall in a village in Conghua, which ""肯定算从化土著了"" (definitely counts as Conghua native/local).
- Then they mention that after Conghua was incorporated into Guangzhou, their ID card changed, and they are unsure if they count as Guangzhou locals.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on a ""几百年的祠堂"" (several-hundred-year-old ancestral hall) implies a family historical root standard for being a local. This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of Conghua ""并入广州"" (incorporated into Guangzhou) and ID card change points to administrative legitimacy considerations (hukou or ID changes), which is RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 村里 (village)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author implies that receiving village dividends (分红) is a criterion for being considered local.
- ""你家有吗？没就不算"" (""If your family doesn't have it, then you don't count"") suggests that having dividends is a standard to judge local identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the presence of village dividends, a form of community resource or economic benefit tied to local social embeddedness, as a standard.
- This corresponds to RL6: Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status).

Step 4: Output results.

我住德政中，无村无分红,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 德政中 (a place name)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 德政中:
- ""我住德政中"" (""I live in Dezhen Zhong"")
- ""无村无分红"" (""no village, no dividends"")

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author mentions living in 德政中 and that there is no village or dividend. The mention of ""no village, no dividends"" implies the absence of traditional village-based community benefits or social embeddedness. However, the author does not explicitly say that having or not having such dividends or village ties defines who is a local person.
- The statement does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that these features are standards for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The text is very short and factual, mentioning residence and lack of village dividends, but no explicit or implicit argument about local identity.
- Therefore, no recognition logic category applies.

Output: RL3","Step 1: Identify named entities:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 公司主管 (company supervisor)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The company supervisor is described as ""土生土长的广州人"" (born and raised local Guangzhou person).
- The supervisor lives near the urban area.
- The supervisor's family does not have dividends (no community dividends or property income).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The phrase ""土生土长的广州人"" strongly indicates RL3 (Family Rootedness / individual growth history) as the author uses ""born and raised"" as a standard for defining a local person.
- The mention of ""家里也没有分红"" (family has no dividends) is mentioned but the author does not explicitly endorse this as a standard for defining a local person, rather it's descriptive about the supervisor's family. So RL6 is not endorsed.
- The location ""靠近市区"" is mentioned but no explicit logic is proposed about spatial boundaries or city core identification, so RL1 is not clearly endorsed.
- No mention of hukou or administrative division, so no RL2.
- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic features, so no RL4.
- No mention of livability or functional facilities, so no RL5.
- No mention of occupational typification, so no RL7.

- The author says they are not a ""genuine local"" (正宗本土本地人), but consider themselves a ""new local"" (新本地人).
- Their grandparents' generation already lived in 佛山.
- They go back to the countryside (乡下) to pay respects during Qingming but have no relatives left there.
- They feel no belonging to the countryside.
- They only consider themselves 佛山 people and 佛山 local only child.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of grandparents' generation already being in 佛山 and the contrast with the countryside where there are no relatives indicates the author uses family rootedness (generational ties) as a standard to define local identity. This fits RL3.
- The feeling of no belonging to the countryside and identifying as 佛山 local person implies the importance of family settlement history and growth history.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative division, dialect, occupation, or property.
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority or social embeddedness, functional livability, or occupational typification.

Output: RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 爷爷老家 (grandfather's hometown)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 广州: The author believes that if you psychologically consider Guangzhou as your hometown, culturally identify with it, and first think of Guangzhou when asked about your hometown, then you are a local person.
- 爷爷老家: Even if your grandfather is from elsewhere and you visit his hometown annually and speak the dialect there, that does not make you a local person of Guangzhou. Being a local means truly identifying with the local culture and food from the heart, without confusion about where you are from.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes psychological and cultural identification with the local culture and food (饮食), and that there is no doubt about one's local identity. This is about cultural-linguistic recognition and internal identity recognition.
- The mention of speaking the dialect at the grandfather's hometown suggests a contrast with the local culture of Guangzhou.
- The emphasis on ""认同本地文化饮食"" and ""打心底里认同"" aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The psychological identification and absence of doubts about where one belongs also imply a cultural identity logic, which is closely tied to RL4.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots in terms of generations, or property, etc.
- The ""爷爷老家"" is used to negate that simply having family roots elsewhere or visiting there does not make you local, emphasizing cultural belonging instead of family root logic.

- The classmate's husband is also a Foshan person with dividends.
- The classmate's daughter has hukou in Foshan, but the whole family lives in the author's place, questioning if the child counts as a Foshan person.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""dividends"" (分红), family genealogy (族谱), and ancestral hall (祠堂) with centuries of history indicates the author endorses or recognizes family rootedness and social embeddedness as standards to define local identity.
- The author also questions the role of hukou (户口) and birthplace in defining local identity, which relates to administrative legitimacy.
- The focus on family genealogy and ancestral halls is typical of RL3 (Family Rootedness).

However, the ancestral graves and ancestral hall remain in the hometown, and they return annually to sweep the graves. The author grew up in a large compound but feels unable to integrate into the local circles. Even though they speak Cantonese fluently, they feel that only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou can form the true Guangzhou identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes family roots and generational depth (""爷爷那一辈来广州定居"", ""祖宗坟茔和宗祠都在老家"", ""只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同""). This aligns with RL3: Family Rootedness.
- The mention of speaking the local dialect (""讲着一口广州话"") as a condition for local identity suggests RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- The mention of social circles (""跟本地人的圈子也融不进去"") relates to social embeddedness, but the author feels excluded despite speaking the dialect, so they do not endorse social embeddedness as a criterion. The mention is more about their experience, not a standard they endorse.

- The author questions whether they can be considered a Guangzhou person.
- Their paternal grandfather is from Dongguan, who settled in Guangzhou during the Anti-Japanese period.
- Their mother is from a Guangzhou rural area.
- The author's hukou is with their mother, and the mother's hukou remains in the village.
- The author receives village dividends but is considered an outsider in the village because of a different family name.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement
- The author uses family origin and generational settlement history (grandfather from Dongguan, mother from Guangzhou rural area) as criteria for local identity, emphasizing family roots.
- The hukou location and village dividends relate to administrative legitimacy and social embeddedness, but the author highlights the hukou is in the village and the village considers them an outsider due to surname difference, showing family rootedness and social embeddedness aspects.
- The core logic the author uses to define if they are a Guangzhou person is based on family lineage and hukou status, with an emphasis on family history and administrative registration.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:

- ""听讲话无祠堂"" implies lack of ancestral hall or family roots.
- ""非农户口"" refers to non-agricultural hukou status.
- ""都有分红"" means all have dividends, implying a form of community or social embeddedness.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- ""无祠堂"" relates to family rootedness (RL3) since ancestral halls symbolize family lineage.
- ""非农户口"" refers directly to hukou registration, which is administrative legitimacy (RL2).
- ""都有分红"" relates to community resources and social embeddedness, implying RL6.

- 广州旧中心城区 (Old central urban area of Guangzhou)
- 城市户口 (city hukou / urban household registration)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that people with city hukou do not get dividends (implying that hukou status is linked to some economic/social rights).
- The old central urban area of Guangzhou has had no villages for hundreds of years (since Qing dynasty city wall area).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""城市户口"" (city hukou) as a basis related to dividends implies the author acknowledges administrative legitimacy as a basis for local identity or social rights.
- The mention that the old center has had no villages for hundreds of years suggests a spatial or historical perception of the local urban core, which aligns with vernacular spatial authority (RL1).
- The author does not explicitly say that hukou or spatial location defines ""local person,"" but the connection of hukou with dividends suggests an implicit recognition of hukou as a standard for local identity or benefits.
- The description of the old center being historically urbanized supports an understanding of the city’s core spatial identity.

Output: RL6","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- 越秀 (Yuexiu)  
- 荔湾 (Liwan)  
- 番禺 (Panyu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- The author hears from a long-time online friend that in some area (either Yuexiu or Liwan), after a period of rural-to-urban conversion, people still receive dividends.  
- The author finds it strange because in Panyu, only rural households receive dividends.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author is discussing who receives dividends based on rural household status or urban conversion, implying that ""local person"" identity or rights (like dividends) relate to rural household registration and transformation. This reflects a logic based on social embeddedness and economic status tied to property or community resources.  
- The mention of ""农转居"" (rural to urban conversion) and dividends implies a recognition logic that local identity or benefits depend on embedded social and economic status, i.e., RL6 (Social Embeddedness).  
- There is also a subtle connection to administrative/legal status since ""农转居"" involves administrative reclassification of rural households to urban households, but the author does not explicitly discuss hukou or administrative boundaries as the basis for local identity, only the dividend benefits tied to rural household status. So RL2 is not clearly endorsed here.  
- No mention of spatial boundaries (RL1), family roots (RL3), dialect (RL4), livability (RL5), or occupational typification (RL7) is present.

- The author mentions that their old building is near Dadongmen.
- They say their family has a genealogy (族谱), but most people in it are not Chinese.
- They mention receiving some subsidy for building repair in kindergarten.
- They say there are no dividends.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of genealogy (族谱) and the ethnic origin of people in it relates to family rootedness or lineage as a basis for identity.
- The author talks about family genealogy but notes the people are mostly not Chinese, implying a reflection on identity linked to family roots.
- There is no mention of administrative divisions, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational groups, or spatial authority.
- The mention of dividends or subsidies is about financial or property benefits, but the author denies having dividends, so no endorsement.
- The family genealogy mention suggests RL3: Family Rootedness.

- The author says: ""我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著""  
  Translation: ""My dad and I are both 'old western' Guangzhou people, but we probably are not natives.""  
- The phrase ""老西关系广州人"" suggests a family rootedness or ancestral relationship to Guangzhou.  
- However, the author says ""should probably not be natives,"" implying that despite family ties, they do not fully identify as natives.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author references family relationship (""我同我老豆"") and ""老西关系"" (likely meaning long-standing family ties or ancestral relations), which relates to RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The author is reflecting on whether this family rootedness makes them natives or not, so the standard being considered is family historical roots.  
- There is no mention of administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, occupation, or spatial authority.  
- No indication that the author endorses or rejects other recognition logics.

- 家乡 (hometown)  
- 现居住城市 (current city of residence)  
- 同一家乡的人 (people from the same hometown)  
- 本地人 (local people)  

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author discusses whether having ancestral village or ancestral house is a necessary standard for being local, and they think it is not necessarily so.  
- The author’s family migrated from their hometown to the current city in the previous generation.  
- Many people from the same hometown self-organize into a ""village"" with ancestral halls and houses, but they keep using hometown dialect among themselves and follow hometown customs during festivals.  
- The author can speak the local language but feels they have not fully integrated into the local culture and therefore do not consider themselves local people.  
- The author distinguishes ""本地人"" (local people) from themselves based on cultural integration.  

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author rejects family rootedness (RL3) as a necessary criterion, since their family migrated one generation ago and ancestral village/house does not define local identity for them.  
- The author emphasizes cultural integration and local cultural norms as the core standard for being a local person. They highlight language usage, customs, and social integration as criteria. This fits RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), since the author uses cultural belonging, dialect usage, and customs to define local identity.  
- The author contrasts ""本地人"" who presumably have fully integrated local culture with themselves who have not, emphasizing cultural embeddedness rather than administrative or spatial definitions.

- ""我广州土生土长"" (I was born and raised in Guangzhou)
- ""我觉得自己只是半个广州人"" (I feel that I am only half a Guangzhou person)

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the family root (ancestral village with ancestral hall) as a standard for defining local identity (""I feel only half a Guangzhou person"").
- The mention of parents’ origins and the fact that the author was born and raised locally shows that the author sees family generational rootedness as important.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 3 (Family Rootedness).

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL3"
？？？我广州话有乡音，我都系广州人，去祠堂都系讲乡音,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: Guangzhou (广州), ancestral hall (祠堂).

Step 2: The author claims that having a local accent (乡音) and speaking the local dialect at the ancestral hall are indicators of being a Guangzhou local.

Step 3: This reflects a linguistic-cultural recognition standard, where speaking the local dialect and having a local accent are used as criteria for local identity.

Step 2: The author says their family has lived here for several generations and speaks Cantonese, but they only consider themselves a ""local person"" of Guangzhou, not a ""native"" (土著), because they are from Panyu.

Step 3: Analysis of recognition logic:
- The mention of ""几代"" (several generations) and family history supports RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- Mentioning ""讲粤语"" (speaking Cantonese) supports RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The distinction of being from Panyu vs. Guangzhou ""native"" implies spatial boundaries and identity differences related to intra-city areas, so RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) applies.

Step 4: Output all applicable recognition logics.

Output: RL1, RL3, RL4"

- 西门口 (West Gate)
- 大东门 (Great East Gate)
- 西关 (Xiguan)
- 广州土著 (Guangzhou natives)
- 美加 (US and Canada)
- 香港 (Hong Kong)
- 南洋 (Nanyang/Southeast Asia)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 广州城: The author states that before the Republic of China period, Guangzhou city only extended from West Gate to Great East Gate, indicating a spatial boundary.
- 家族历史: The author's family did business in Xiguan during Qing dynasty, fled, then returned.
- 广州土著: Most Guangzhou natives have emigrated abroad; very few remain in Guangzhou. More Guangzhou natives are in US, Canada, Hong Kong, and Nanyang than in Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author defines ""local person"" based on historical spatial boundaries of Guangzhou city, i.e., the area from West Gate to Great East Gate during the Republic of China era. This is a vernacular spatial boundary rather than official administrative.
- The mention of family history (no ancestral hall, business in Xiguan, fleeing and returning) reflects family rootedness and lineage.
- The discussion of Guangzhou natives emigrating and the rarity of locals left implies the author sees local identity as linked to long-term family roots.
- The author does not mention administrative divisions or hukou.
- No mention of dialect or cultural language.
- No mention of livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.

Step 4: Output:
RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) - defining local based on historical city boundaries.
RL3 (Family Rootedness) - defining local based on family lineage and generational roots.

- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 本地人 (local people)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 广州: The author discusses a community that has lived for generations in Guangzhou, even if moved for various reasons, but insists on retaining Guangzhou's language, culture, dietary habits, and traditional spiritual core.
- 本地人: Contrasted with the above, the author mentions people who only speak Mandarin, do not eat local dishes (e.g., 白切鸡), and do not listen to Cantonese songs, implying these people are less ""Guangzhou"" than the former group.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the retention of local language (Cantonese), culture, and traditional habits as criteria for being ""more Guangzhou,"" implicitly endorsing language and cultural habits as identity markers. This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The mention of ""世代居住"" (generations living) suggests the importance of family rootedness and generational ties, aligning with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author contrasts people who have lost these cultural habits with those who maintain them, implying these cultural and generational factors are core to defining who is truly local.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 广州:
- The author's family has been in Guangzhou for at least two generations (外公 started working there, the author's mother grew up there).
- The family speaks Cantonese at home.
- They only occasionally visit their ancestral hometown during Qingming Festival.
- Despite these facts, they do not consider themselves ""Guangzhou people.""

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of family generational history (""外公开始来广州工作"", ""我妈他们在广州长大的"") and the implication that despite long residence, they do not identify as locals suggests the author is aware of family rootedness as a criterion but points out the family's own rejection of the ""local"" identity. However, the author does not endorse this standard for defining local person identity; rather, the family themselves do not claim the local identity.
- The mention of speaking Cantonese at home (""在家也都是说粤语"") points to linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for local identity.
- The family does not claim to be Guangzhou people despite meeting RL3 and RL4 criteria, which may imply that linguistic-cultural recognition or family rootedness alone are insufficient or not accepted as the sole standard by the family.
- The author does not explicitly endorse any of these standards as their own criteria for defining local person identity.
- The text mainly describes the family's own identification stance, not the author's own endorsement of these standards.
- Therefore, no recognition logic categories are clearly endorsed by the author as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

- The emphasis on ""老四区世居"" and ""五代土生土长"" indicates RL3: Family Rootedness.
- Mentioning ""有分红有地"" (dividends and land) implies RL6: Social Embeddedness.
- The reference to specific old districts (老越秀、老荔湾、老东山、海珠) as the core local areas, and defining locals by these areas, implies RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 2: Viewpoint: The author points out that many native Guangzhou people born after 2000 (""00后"") do not speak Cantonese, implying a shift in linguistic-cultural traits among local people.

Step 3: Recognition Logic: The author discusses the criterion of speaking the local dialect (Cantonese) as a standard for local identity but indicates that this standard is changing or weakening. The author implicitly acknowledges that linguistic-cultural recognition (dialect speaking) has been a traditional standard but is now less absolute. This reflects RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

- Regarding Sydney, the author mentions many locally born Australian Chinese who speak fluent Cantonese indistinguishable from natives.
- The author also contrasts these with some Guangzhou locals who have lost fluency or accent.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the ability to speak fluent local dialect (Cantonese) as a marker of local identity or ""local person"" status.
- The examples given show that linguistic fluency and accent are key to identifying someone as ""local"" despite place of birth or origin.
- There is an implicit endorsement that speaking the local dialect fluently (with no accent) is a standard for defining who is ""local,"" regardless of administrative origin or family roots.

- The author believes that only those whose ancestors (祖辈) have been in Guangzhou and have ancestral halls (祠堂) count as ""locals.""
- People who recently moved or newly registered (新入户) in Guangzhou are considered ""new Guangzhou people,"" not true locals.
- The author identifies as a ""local"" from Guangzhou, specifically from Zengcheng.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses ""祖辈都是在广州这边的"" and ""有祠堂"" as criteria, emphasizing family historical roots and lineage. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- No explicit mention of administrative registration as the core criterion, although ""新入户"" is mentioned, but in a contrasting way, not as a standard the author endorses.

- ""本地人"" (local people)  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/native people)  
- ""那里"" (there, presumably referring to some community or area)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author distinguishes ""本地人"" (local people) from ""土著"" (indigenous/native people), implying that being a local person is not the same as being indigenous.  
- The phrase ""分红的时候可没见你卜佬"" (""during dividends, I didn’t see you around"") implies that participation in local community benefits or shared resources (dividends) is a criterion for being considered truly local.  
- The verb ""卜佬"" here suggests ""hanging around"" or being involved in local social activities.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author implies that being a ""local person"" is connected to actual social embeddedness and participation in community benefits (like dividends). This aligns with RL6: Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status).  
- The author also distinguishes ""local person"" from ""土著"" (indigenous), but does not clearly endorse family rootedness or generational depth as a standard; rather, the emphasis is on social embeddedness (participation in dividends).

- 汉阳  
- 江汉  
- 江岸  
- 硚口

- 长江  
- 汉水  

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
The author explains that Wuhan is traditionally divided into three towns: 汉口, 武昌, 汉阳, which are geographical/cultural units, while the many districts (区) like 江汉, 江岸, 硚口, 东西湖 are administrative divisions. The author emphasizes that the old Wuhan people recognize the three towns (三镇) as the core local divisions, not the administrative districts. The geographic boundaries such as being north of the Yangtze River (长江) and Han River (汉水) define 汉口. The author supports the vernacular spatial understanding of the city, indicating that the ""local"" identity aligns with these traditional spatial units, not the official administrative boundaries.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author endorses the vernacular spatial authority (RL1) logic: using traditional, habitual local spatial categories (三镇) rather than official administrative districts to define what counts as ""local"" Wuhan or ""old Wuhan.""  
- The author explicitly contrasts administrative divisions with vernacular/geographical divisions, indicating that the latter is the meaningful standard for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results:

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author refers to people living in 光谷 as being at the bottom of a ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain), and ""not daring to speak,"" implying a social evaluation or stereotype associated with that area.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: The author is expressing a social evaluation tied to the residential area 光谷, suggesting a social hierarchy based on place of residence. This fits RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as the author implies that living in 光谷 places someone at a lower social status or less embedded in the local social hierarchy.

There is no explicit mention of administrative status (RL2), family roots (RL3), dialect (RL4), or spatial cognitive maps (RL1). The evaluation is about social embeddedness/status.

Step 4: Output:

我经常因为我的青普被当成外码,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""青普"" (Qingpu district)

Step 2: The author states that they are often mistaken as an outsider because of their Qingpu district identity.

Step 3: The author implies that the place of residence or district identity (Qingpu) is used as a standard to judge whether someone is a local or not. This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it involves social perceptions of spatial categories (district-based local identity).

Step 4: Output the result.

- 取水楼 (Qushuilou)
- 江汉路 (Jianghan Road)
- 黄浦路 (Huangpu Road)
- 民众乐园 (Minzhong Park)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that Wuhan people, especially those living in the core of Hankou, think that areas outside the Inner Ring are ""villages"".
- They believe Wuhan Tiandi's housing prices are not the highest in Wuhan.
- People who have lived since childhood in the area around Liudu Bridge, Youyi Road, Qushuilou, and Jianghan Road have a deeply rooted idea that Huangpu Road area is suburban.
- In their minds, the area around Minzhong Park is the true core of Hankou, the urban area, and city center.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic:
- The author's description centers on how locals perceive spatial boundaries within Wuhan, particularly what counts as the ""core"" of Hankou and what is considered suburban or village.
- This reflects collective local perceptions of urban spatial categories that are not administrative but emotional and habitual.
- The emphasis on areas ""inside the Inner Ring"" as core, and others as village or suburban, is a typical example of RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of rootedness ""from childhood"" supports RL3 (Family Rootedness) as the idea of local identity is linked to growing up in certain neighborhoods.
- However, the main logic is about the spatial classification and local emotional map.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, social embeddedness, livability, or occupation.

- 蔡甸话 (Caidian dialect)
- 武汉市内 (Wuhan city center)
- 大女儿 (eldest daughter)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 老武汉的土著: The author mentions their own experience growing up as a local (土著) in Wuhan, feeling looked down upon by others, and notes the strong sense of superiority among poorer old locals.
- 蔡甸话: Speaking the Caidian dialect in the city center triggers a superior and disdainful attitude from others; the author values speaking the dialect and regrets their daughter does not speak it.
- 武汉市内: The author finds less attraction to the city center now, but notes that young people there are friendly and polite.
- 大女儿: The daughter not speaking the local dialect is regretted as a failure to educate her properly.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on speaking the local dialect (蔡甸话) as a marker of identity and insider status, and the associated attitudes, aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- The discussion of ""老武汉的土著"" and feelings of superiority or disdain tied to local origins also reflects family rootedness and local belonging but no explicit mention of generational depth or family roots, so RL3 is less supported.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or hukou, so RL2 is not applicable.
- The author discusses social attitudes linked to dialect and local identity but not property, occupation, or livability, so RL6, RL5, and RL7 are not supported.
- The mention of ""老土著"" and distinctions between locals and others is partly spatial but focuses on dialect rather than spatial boundaries, so RL1 is not strongly supported.

Step 2: Viewpoints:  
- 黄陂 is ""属于武汉"" (belongs to Wuhan) — the author uses administrative affiliation to define local identity.  
- The author mentions the metro line extension to 黄陂, implying increased convenience but does not use this as a criterion for local identity.  
- The author says that when they say they are from 黄陂, no one looks down on or is surprised — implying acceptance of 黄陂 as local.  
Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:  
- ""属于武汉"" (belongs to Wuhan) is an administrative boundary criterion — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).  
- No mention of family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or vernacular spatial authority explicitly.  
- The metro line mention is about convenience but not used as a local identity standard.

- The author is from 新洲.
- The author basically does not consider themselves a 武汉人 (Wuhan local).
- The author feels that 武汉人 do not really respect 新洲 people.
- The author usually uses administrative division (""行政区划"") to consider themselves as 武汉人.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author references an old Wuhan saying defining the 汉口 area as ""上有古田，下有肉联（肉联就是现在的堤角）"", implying a vernacular spatial categorization of these areas.
- The author lives in 古田 and finds it convenient and prosperous, mentioning improvements like 宜家 and 山姆 increasing 古田's popularity.
- The author hopes both 古田 and 堤角 develop well together.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The use of an old local saying to define 汉口 subregions and distinguish 堤角 and 古田 reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of convenience and prosperity of 古田 due to commercial developments (宜家, 山姆) is about livability but is more of a personal evaluation and not explicitly linked to defining local identity. So RL5 is not clearly endorsed as a standard for defining ""local person"".
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

家里人是武钢的，记得小时候，一些武昌的亲戚一边羡慕我家人的“铁饭碗”一边嘲笑我是乡里伢。,RL7,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 武钢 (Wugang), 武昌 (Wuchang)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author mentions family members working at 武钢 (Wugang), which is likely a steel company.
- The author recalls that some relatives from 武昌 (Wuchang) both admired their family’s ""铁饭碗"" (stable job) and simultaneously mocked the author as a ""乡里伢"" (local rural kid).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""铁饭碗"" (stable job) and family members working at 武钢 suggests a link between occupational status and local identity.
- The relatives from 武昌 mocking the author as ""乡里伢"" (rural kid) implies an occupational or social typification associated with the area or family.
- The author's own family’s occupational background (working at Wugang) is used as a recognition logic for identity.
- This fits RL7 (Occupational Typification): the author uses occupational group (steel factory workers) as a basis for local identity.
- The term ""乡里伢"" (rural kid) also implies a social typification, again pointing to RL7.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author is a descendant of people from Qingshan District in the northeast, born and raised locally.
- Many old Wuhan people consider many places as ""countryside"" and cannot change this impression quickly.
- The author is considered by many Hankou people as from a remote or peripheral place.
- The author believes people from surrounding areas are not authentic Wuhan locals.
- The author refers to old perceptions (old conceptions) that cannot be changed.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses family rootedness (""土生土长的"" meaning born and raised locally, descendants) as a standard to define local person identity → RL3.
- The author refers to old collective perceptions about which areas count as ""local"" or ""authentic"" and which do not (e.g., Hankou people considering Qingshan people as from a remote place; surrounding areas not counted as authentic locals) → this is a vernacular spatial authority (shared social perception of spatial identity) → RL1.

"武汉13个区的GDP排名、未来发展、人口以及房价情况一直备受关注。外地人常认为汉口区是武汉最富有的区，实际上他们说的是江汉区。江汉路步行街、国广武广每日都在刷新武汉的最高消费记录，西北湖的金融圈也是高楼林立。不过，江汉区2024年GDP仅1627亿，在武汉排名第六，房价约15000到3万之间。
 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","RL1, RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:

- 东湖高新区 / 中国光谷 (Donghu High-tech Zone / China Optics Valley)
- 汉阳区 (Hanyang District)
- 蔡甸区 (Caidian District)
- 武汉 (Wuhan overall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity regarding local identity definition standards:
- 汉口区: Mentioned as commonly mistaken by outsiders for the richest district, but no direct standard for defining local person identity.
- 江汉区: Described as wealthy, with landmarks and high consumption, but ranking sixth in GDP and specific house price ranges mentioned. No direct claim that these economic or spatial features define ""local person"" identity.
- 江岸区: Described as a top wealthy area with cultural atmosphere, education level, and development potential. The cultural atmosphere and historical landmarks are emphasized. This suggests recognition of cultural-linguistic or spatial symbolic attributes.
- 东湖高新区 (光谷): Emphasized as the most economically developed area, with high-tech industries, high incomes, many young people and outsiders. The author notes it as attracting many young and external population, with relatively affordable housing for many. This is more about economic and demographic trends rather than local identity definition.
- 汉阳区: Described as the poorest district with declining commercial areas but rich in tourism, culture, and livability. The scenic beauty and cultural references are highlighted, indicating a cultural-symbolic recognition of the area.
- 蔡甸区: GDP and population status low, described as a retirement area with low house prices. No explicit or implicit standard for defining local person identity.
- Wuhan overall: Discussion on polarization of districts based on economic fundamentals, population inflow/outflow, and housing prices. The author implies that economic development and population attraction are key to district competitiveness but does not explicitly use these as local identity standards.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- For 江岸区 and 汉阳区, the author emphasizes cultural atmosphere, historical landmarks, and scenic beauty as important qualities associated with these areas. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because the author highlights collective emotional maps and symbolic meanings of these districts.
- The mention of education level and cultural atmosphere in 江岸区 also suggests a slight RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) component, as culture and education are part of local cultural identity.
- For 江汉区 and 东湖高新区, the author mainly discusses economic development, GDP, industries, and population, but does not explicitly or implicitly use these as criteria for defining ""local person"" identity. They are presented more as factual economic data.
- The overall narrative about population inflow/outflow and economic development shaping district competitiveness relates to urban development rather than local identity recognition logic.
- 房价 discussions are economic evaluations and do not serve as local person identity standards in the author's argument.

- The author mentions the psychological gap and the reaction of old city residents to outsiders.
- The author highlights the generational rootedness of old city residents.
- The author implies that ""old city residents"" are defined by their multi-generational family roots in Wuhan.
- The mention of ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" (ancestors for generations are Wuhan people) points to family rootedness as a standard to define locals.
- The ""排外"" (exclusion) is a reaction to outsiders who do not share this rootedness.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author explicitly or implicitly uses family rootedness (multi-generations) as a criterion for being a ""local person.""
- The text does not mention administrative divisions or hukou.
- The text does not mention dialect or cultural-linguistic features.
- The text does not mention spatial boundaries or vernacular spatial authority.

我土生土长的武汉人，说实话20年前我觉得汉口是武汉最富裕的地方，现在光谷发展的太快了太好了，很多住市区的人跑这边来上班，武汉未来还是看光谷。,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities: 武汉, 汉口, 光谷

Step 2: The author identifies as a native (""土生土长的武汉人"") and comments on the development and wealth of 汉口 and 光谷. The author used to think 汉口 was the wealthiest part of Wuhan but now believes 光谷 has developed rapidly and attracted many city residents to work there. The author concludes that Wuhan's future depends on 光谷.

Step 3: The author focuses on spatial areas within Wuhan and their status or identity, emphasizing economic development and urban growth. The author does not mention administrative divisions or hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation. The focus is on the spatial identity and evaluation of areas based on development and livability. However, the author does not explicitly say that development or wealth defines ""local person"" identity, only that these areas have changed in prominence.

The key point is the author claims to be a ""土生土长的武汉人"" (born and raised local), which implies family rootedness (RL3) as a standard of local identity. The author also uses the concept of areas within the city (汉口, 光谷) to indicate spatial categories, but the focus is more on development status than traditional spatial identity or emotional maps.

Because the author emphasizes ""土生土长"" (born and raised), this supports RL3 (Family Rootedness). The mention of spatial areas (汉口, 光谷) and their changing status is more about city development than about local identity boundaries, so RL1 is weak or not clearly endorsed.

Step 4: The recognized logic is RL3.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:

- The author uses infrastructure and convenience features (airport, logistics market, cultural tourism, subway lines) to evaluate the superiority of 黄陂 over 新洲. This relates to Functional Livability (RL5).

- The mention of 阳逻 being ""cut off"" from 新洲, leaving only remote villages, implies a spatial boundary and the perception of areas as more or less ""local"" or valuable. This suggests Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1).

- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

- Historically, 厦门 belonged to them (海沧、集美、同安), but they did not belong to 厦门.
- Historically, 厦门 referred only to the old city area around 中山路 because 厦门城 was located there.
- Regarding 翔安, for 厦门 people, 翔安 is considered part of 同安.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author discusses the historical and current spatial boundaries of 厦门 and its subareas.
- The author emphasizes historical core areas (中山路老市区 as the historical 厦门 city) versus current administrative inclusion.
- The author also notes locals' perceptions of areas (翔安 is considered part of 同安 by locals).
- This reflects a vernacular spatial understanding of which areas count as ""core"" or ""local"" within 厦门, based on historical and collective emotional mapping rather than just administrative divisions.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author explains the administrative evolution of Xiamen: from a small economic zone in Huli, to the entire island, then merging surrounding districts into Xiamen city proper.
- The author rejects the claim that places like Jimei and Tongan are not part of Xiamen by pointing out that these places have their own distinct names and identities.
- The author emphasizes that people from Jimei and Guankou have their own origins and are known as Jimei people, Guankou people, etc., highlighting the historical and cultural distinctiveness of these areas.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author refers to administrative changes and official district mergers as the basis for defining the scope of Xiamen and its local identity (RL2: Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author also emphasizes the historical and cultural distinctiveness of areas like Jimei and Guankou, and their long-standing local identity, which reflects RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority (local names, historical recognition of places).
- The phrase ""那么多年人家就是集美人，灌口人，这样的由来"" (For so many years, they have been Jimei people, Guankou people, that is the origin) indicates an emphasis on local identity based on longstanding place names and collective recognition, supporting RL1.

- The author expected housing prices in 厦门岛内 (Xiamen island area) to be not too high.
- Upon checking, the author finds that the housing prices are similar to those in 上海 (Shanghai).

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author is comparing housing prices between two areas.
- The focus is on property prices, but the author does not explicitly or implicitly state that housing price or property price is a standard to define ""local person"" identity.
- The author is simply expressing surprise at the high prices, no mention of local identity or ""who counts as local.""
- No indication that the author uses housing price or property ownership as a criterion for defining local person identity or the scope/quality of ""local"" area in terms of identity.
- Therefore, no recognition logic categories apply.

- 福州: Compared with Xiamen regarding wages.
- 香港: Mentioned as a place where the author studied or stayed for some years.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author uses ""having a house in Xiamen"" as a marker for local people: ""厦门本地人只要在厦门有房子"" (""Xiamen locals as long as they have a house in Xiamen"") — This suggests using property ownership as a criterion for local identity, matching RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The author praises Xiamen's city functions (education, transportation, medical resources, environment), highlighting livability and city quality, which reflects RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of ""国企包括公务员工资"" (state-owned enterprise and civil servant wages) being higher in Xiamen is descriptive but not used to define local identity, so no RL7 (Occupational Typification) is strongly implied here.
- The author does not mention hukou or administrative boundaries, so no RL2.

- 乡镇: some classmates from townships came to buy houses or study in the area after high school, and these classmates have a strong sense of superiority.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author emphasizes being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) in Qingxiu District as a basis for local identity, implicitly endorsing family rootedness / individual growth history as a standard for being a local person. This matches RL3.  
- The author contrasts this with newcomers (新南宁人) and township people who moved later, implying that local identity is connected to generational or long-term rootedness.  
- The author does not mention administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, or other logics.  
- The mention of buying houses or settling down by township classmates is described, but the author does not endorse this as a standard for local identity, rather, they criticize the superiority complex. So RL6 is not endorsed.  
- The mention of spatial areas (Qingxiu District, ASEAN Business District) is not used to define or evaluate local identity based on spatial boundaries or emotional maps, so RL1 is not applicable.

- 同学们觉得我家穷（a social evaluation, but about wealth, not local identity definition)
- 到东盟商务区买房，房价几千块一平（discusses house price, but not explicitly or implicitly as a local identity standard)

Step 3: Analysis:
- The author mentions 青秀区 was formerly a big rural area, which may imply a historical spatial identity distinction (RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of family being considered poor is a social economic status comment, but no indication that the author uses wealth as a standard for local identity (so no RL6).
- Buying a house at a certain price is a fact but no indication that house ownership or price is used as a local identity criterion (no RL6).
- No mention of administrative status, family rootedness, dialect, occupational typification, or functional livability as local identity standards.

Step 2: The author mentions being a local (土著) of 青秀区 but questions their superiority. The author recalls childhood experiences around 医科大 and needing to go to 朝阳 or 西乡塘 to play and shop.  
Step 3: The core argument relates to the spatial experience and habitual local activity areas rather than administrative or family roots. The author implies a local spatial understanding that 青秀区 locals do not have a special advantage, as their leisure activities centered elsewhere. This relates to the shared, habitual local perceptions of spatial areas and their symbolic meaning.  
Step 4: This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

朝阳广场的人流大而且确实鱼龙混杂啊，但是正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities: 朝阳广场, 南宁人

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""朝阳广场的人流大而且确实鱼龙混杂啊"" — describes the crowd at Chaoyang Square as large and mixed.
- ""正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好"" — the ""authentic Nanning people"" definitely would not say Chaoyang is bad.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author mentions ""正宗南宁人"" (authentic Nanning people) as a group who would not say Chaoyang is bad, implying a standard of ""authentic locals"" who have a positive or at least tolerant recognition of this place.
- The author implies a local identity standard related to being a ""正宗南宁人"" (authentic local), which might relate to RL3 (Family Rootedness) or RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), but the text does not explicitly mention family roots or dialect.
- The emphasis is on ""正宗南宁人"" as an identity group, which suggests some standard of local identity, but the standard is not detailed.
- The author does not discuss administrative status, family roots, language, or social embeddedness explicitly.
- The mention of ""鱼龙混杂"" (mixed crowd) is an observation, not a standard.
- The main recognition logic is the implicit assumption of a local identity group (""正宗南宁人"") who have a collective attitude towards the place.

Given that the author refers to ""正宗南宁人"" as a local identity, this aligns best with RL3 (Family Rootedness) because ""正宗"" often implies lineage or long-term family ties.

- 朝阳广场 nearby metro stations are urban villages.
- The area is convenient for life because key places like the zoo, train station, and Chaoyang are nearby.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author evaluates areas based on the convenience of living functions (proximity to metro, zoo, train station, lively environment).
- The contrast with 青秀五象 focuses on city construction quality (new vs. mixed old/new), but no explicit statement that new construction defines ""local person"" identity.

- The author lives in a place with relatively low pedestrian flow and seldom goes out shopping except nearby malls like 万象城, 盛天地.  
- The author once took the subway to 朝阳广场 and felt the place was crowded with mostly young people, full of vitality, and felt happy.  
Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author comments on differences in street crowd composition and area atmosphere but does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define who is a local person.  
- The mention of living in 南宁 for over ten years might suggest some family rootedness or personal growth history, but the author does not explicitly connect this to defining ""local person.""  
- The discussion about crowd density and area vitality is more about livability or atmosphere but does not explicitly link to defining local identity.  
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, property, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as criteria for ""local person.""  
Step 4: Conclusion: The author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse any recognition logic as standards for defining ""local person.""

别搞青秀区全区，我寻思着小时候住星湖路的从来没说过别的地方破，毕竟我们自己的房子也挺破。,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 青秀区, 星湖路

Step 2: The author talks about 青秀区 as a whole, but seems to reject the idea of labeling the entire district as good or bad (""别搞青秀区全区""). The author mentions their childhood residence on 星湖路 and notes that they never said other places were bad because their own house was also quite poor.

Step 3: The author uses their personal family history (""小时候住星湖路"") as a criterion or evidence for identity, implying that growing up in a place is a basis for being a local person. This reflects Recognition Logic 3 (Family Rootedness). The mention of the house condition (""房子也挺破"") is more about material status but not used to define local identity, so RL6 or RL5 do not apply here. The author also rejects broad spatial labeling of the whole district, which might hint at RL1 but the main logic expressed is about personal growth history.

Step 4: Output the matched recognition logic.

别说青秀区，江南区某穷小区都有优越感，就亭洪供电局下来一点，某桥底下，我以前的小学伙伴爷爷奶奶家住那边，我周末会去找她玩，然后那边一楼是个瓦房停车场，应该是那对老头老阿奶的，然后某一次我去找她在楼下等她，那老阿奶就很莫名其妙的来一句，我们家是南宁本地人哦，是本地人来的我当时？搞笑死了哈哈哈哈哈哈哈对不起我山旮旯建政路那一代的，小时候只觉得听得不对劲，长大了真是觉得井底之蛙优越感，不看看那个小区有多烂,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 青秀区 (Qingxiu District)
- 江南区 (Jiangnan District)
- 亭洪供电局 (Tinghong Power Supply Bureau)
- 某桥底下 (under some bridge)
- 小学伙伴爷爷奶奶家住那边 (grandparents' house of the author's childhood friend)
- 山旮旯建政路那一代 (the author's local area, Jianzheng Road area)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions that even a poor neighborhood in Jiangnan District has a sense of superiority.
- The old lady from the poor neighborhood claims ""we are locals of Nanning,"" which the author finds laughable and feels this superiority is misplaced.
- The author identifies themselves as from a ""mountainous backwater"" area (Jianzheng Road area).
- The author reflects that as a child, they found the local people's claim odd, but now as an adult, they see it as a kind of narrow-minded superiority.
- The author also comments on how poor the neighborhood is, contradicting the claimed superiority.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The old lady's claim ""we are locals of Nanning"" is an assertion of local identity based on being physically from the city or area.
- The author critiques this claim, implying that mere residence or origin in a poor area does not confer authentic ""local"" status.
- The author self-identifies with a specific area (Jianzheng Road) as truly local, implicitly contrasting with the other area's claim.
- There is a focus on spatial identity and the symbolic meaning of different areas (poor neighborhood vs. mountain backwater area).
- The author references ""本地人"" (local people) as an identity claim linked to place.
- The author also mentions the poor condition of the neighborhood, but this is a critique of the neighborhood, not a standard for local identity.
- There is no mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, property, or occupation.
- The core logic is about local identity linked to spatial belonging and the social meaning of place.

Therefore, the author's recognition logic is primarily about the spatial and symbolic meaning of areas, i.e., RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority.

本南宁人小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩啊，只是后来长大了，能选择的地方也多了，朝阳又越来越难停车（小车和电车都难），所以才去的少了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 南宁, 朝阳

Step 2: The author says ""本南宁人小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩"" — indicating a shared childhood habit of going to 朝阳 among local people. Later, with growing options and difficulties parking, visits to 朝阳 decreased.

Step 3: The author is emphasizing a habitual, shared local practice (going to 朝阳 as a local leisure place in childhood). This reflects a vernacular spatial authority: the author assumes 朝阳 as a recognized local place for locals, indicating a spatial identity embedded in social habits and collective memory. No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 4: Output the corresponding recognition logic category:

Step 2: The author mentions that early capital bigwigs in Nanning gathered in Chaoyang, which was the center when Nanning was small. The old Wanguo Restaurant in Chaoyang was the place where these big bosses talked business.

Step 3: The author uses the idea of spatial centrality (Chaoyang as the center of Nanning) to implicitly define the importance or identity of an area within the city. This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author indicates a local perception of core areas by using Chaoyang as a ""center"" or focal point of local business and social activity.

No administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is explicitly or implicitly invoked as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity.

- 西乡塘农村 (Xixiangtang rural area)
- 朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square)
- 天桥和地下通道 (overpass and underpass)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author identifies themselves as from ""西乡塘农村"" (a rural area).
- The author recalls childhood fear when going to ""朝阳广场,"" especially when passing the overpass and underpass because there were many beggars there.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is referring to their origin from a rural area (西乡塘农村) as part of their identity, but this is more a statement of origin than a standard for defining ""local person.""
- The fear of beggars at Chaoyang Square is a personal experience, not a standard for defining local identity.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or spatial authority as standards for defining ""local person.""
- The mention of rural origin might hint at RL7 (occupational typification or social class), but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use it as a criterion to define ""local person"" identity.
- No explicit or implicit recognition logic defining ""local person"" identity is present.

Step 4: Output:

不是，我也南宁人，但不是青秀区的，出来10年了那里的人装逼成这样了吗青秀区是什么了不起的地方吗？房价多少啊？,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 南宁 (Nanning), 青秀区 (Qingxiu District)

Step 2: The author claims they are also a Nanning person but not from Qingxiu District, and questions the elevated status or superiority of Qingxiu District people (""装逼成这样了吗"", ""青秀区是什么了不起的地方吗？""). The author also mentions housing prices (""房价多少啊？"").

Step 3: The author challenges the implied superiority or identity based on Qingxiu District residency, implying that being from Qingxiu District is considered a standard of local identity or superiority by others, but the author disputes this. The mention of housing price is a rhetorical question questioning the importance of that standard. The author implicitly critiques spatial hierarchical identity based on intra-city area distinctions.

This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author is discussing the social perception and emotional map of which parts of Nanning count as ""real"" locals or prestigious areas (Qingxiu District). The author disputes this local spatial hierarchy.

The author does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), dialect/culture (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as defining local identity here.

- France/French people (法国人)  
- Southeast Asian people (东南亚人)  
- ASEAN Business District (东盟商务区)  
- Nanning (南宁)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author says French people look at Southeast Asian people (specifically in the ASEAN Business District) as if they were colonial subjects, which the author finds amusing.  
- The author identifies themselves as a native-born Nanning person (""土生土长南宁人"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author self-identifies as a native Nanning person based on being born and raised there. This is a direct reference to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as ""土生土长"" means ""born and raised locally,"" emphasizing individual growth history as a standard for local identity.  
- The mention of the ""ASEAN Business District"" and French people's view is more of an observation and does not indicate the author's use of administrative boundaries or vernacular spatial authority to define local identity.  
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, dialect, social embeddedness, livability, or occupational typification as defining local identity.  
- The core point is the author asserts their local identity based on birth and upbringing in Nanning.

本广西人现在是“地铁老人脸”。这都还没富起来呢，就开始拿起贵族姿态了我们偏远农村的广西人看来只能下广东或者出国了。不配奢望首府,RL3,"Step 1: Identify named entities:
- 广西 (Guangxi)
- 广东 (Guangdong)
- 首府 (capital city)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author identifies as a person from Guangxi.
- The author mentions being a ""地铁老人脸"" (someone who has been living in the city long enough to be familiar with the subway), implying some degree of local residence.
- The author notes that despite not being wealthy, some people have adopted a ""noble posture,"" implying a social hierarchy.
- The author contrasts ""偏远农村的广西人"" (remote rural Guangxi people) with those who might move to Guangdong or abroad.
- The author expresses a sentiment that people like them ""不配奢望首府"" (do not deserve to hope for the capital city).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author contrasts urban ""地铁老人脸"" status with rural origins, suggesting that local identity involves long-term residence or familiarity with urban living (implying RL3: Family Rootedness or RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""地铁老人脸"" indicates a kind of local rootedness or growth history in the city (RL3).
- The reference to ""贵族姿态"" and ""偏远农村"" indicates social embeddedness and class distinctions but the author is critical of this, not endorsing it as a standard to define local person.
- The discussion of migration to Guangdong or abroad is about mobility, but no explicit standard is given for defining local identity based on this.
- The author seems to imply that being from rural Guangxi and not wealthy excludes one from being ""local"" or accepted in the capital, but this is a critical observation rather than an endorsement.

Conclusion:
The author uses the notion of being a ""地铁老人脸"" to indicate local rootedness or long-term residence in the city, which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness). The other elements (social status, wealth, migration) are mentioned but not endorsed as standards for defining local identity.

- 南宁大桥头 (Nanning Bridgehead)
- 青秀 (Qingxiu)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author notes that ""土著对老城区的执念是比较深的毕竟是从小到大生活学习的地方"" which indicates locals have a deep attachment to the old city area because they grew up there.
- The author mentions their own experience living in Wuxiang near Nanning Bridgehead and commuting to Qingxiu, but finds it difficult compared to a 5-minute commute they were used to.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The deep attachment to the old city area because it is where one grew up and studied reflects RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The mention of commuting times and convenience relates to living function, but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this to define ""local person"" identity or local area status, rather just personal preference. So RL5 is not applicable here for defining local identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority used as identity standards.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author says they are used to living in a work unit dormitory and are not used to living in a commercial residential community.
- When wanting to eat something, they must return to the old city area, especially for late-night snacks, which involves driving half an hour.
- Recently brought their child back to their maternal home to stay, in order to go to Langdong Village for food tonight.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author expresses a preference or habit of living in the work unit dormitory versus commercial residential community.
- The repeated reference to ""老城区"" (old city area) as a place to get food, especially late-night snacks, implies a habitual or culturally recognized spatial boundary or area with special significance.
- The mention of ""单位宿舍"" and ""老城区"" indicates a habitual living pattern and a spatial identity linked to old city areas.
- The author implies the old city area is a core local area or a place strongly associated with local identity or lifestyle.
- The focus is on habitual spatial usage and emotional attachment to old city area (老城区), reflecting a vernacular spatial authority.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- The discussion about travel inconvenience is about habitual living and food culture spatiality, not about livability or social embeddedness.

- 五象湖地铁站 (Wuxiang Lake Metro Station)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author describes the feeling when arriving at Wuxiang Lake Metro Station exit: it feels like leaving the city and entering a remote, wild area, with a long walk before encountering signs of life.
- The author personally feels uncomfortable living there.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses the feeling of ""urban vs. wild area"" and the presence or absence of ""living atmosphere"" as criteria to evaluate the livability or desirability of the area.
- This corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author evaluates the convenience and life atmosphere of the area to judge its quality as a ""local"" living place.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a standard to define who is a ""local person,"" only to describe the area’s livability.
- The task states to only annotate if the author uses the standard to define ""local person"" identity or evaluate ""local"" area quality.
- Here, the author expresses a personal preference about living convenience but does not connect it to defining ""local person"" identity or area identity.
- Therefore, no RL category should be annotated.

- 大院 (the ""compound"" or old residential compound)
- 南宁人 (people of Nanning)
- 老城区 (old city area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 大院: The author describes a trajectory where people grow up in the compound, move out, buy new houses, and then returning to the compound no longer feels the same, implying that the neighborhood relations have changed.
- 南宁人: The author generalizes that many Nanning people have similar trajectories.
- 老城区: The author states that while the old city area is good, the past is inevitably past.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the change in neighborhood relations and the feeling of ""localness"" linked to the old compound and old city area. This indicates a recognition of local identity tied to the social embeddedness and the historical rootedness of living in the old compound and the old city area.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or hukou.
- There is no mention of dialect or language.
- There is no mention of occupational types.
- The author mentions the change in social relations and that returning to the old compound no longer feels the same, indicating the importance of social embeddedness (RL6).
- The mention of ""grow up in the compound"" and the change over time also relates to family rootedness or individual growth history (RL3).
- The mention of old city area and compound as places with particular social meaning, and the sense that they no longer represent the same local identity, implies vernacular spatial authority (RL1).

- 金山大道: Crossing it changes the perception of the area.
- 七星岗: Where the author currently lives.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author conveys that their family has a shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perception of what counts as the ""urban area"" or core city in Chongqing. For example, 解放碑 is considered the core urban area, 大坪 is also recognized as urban by the father, but 照母山 was initially seen as a remote area beyond 金山大道, considered ""荒郊野岭"" (wilderness), showing a collective emotional map and symbolic meaning of these areas.
- This perception reflects vernacular spatial authority (RL1), as it is about local perceptions of spatial boundaries within the city, not official administrative boundaries.
- The author does not mention administrative divisions, hukou, or family roots as standards for local identity here.
- There is no mention of dialect, cultural habits, or social embeddedness.
- The discussion of areas as ""荒郊野岭"" or ""宇宙中心"" relates to symbolic spatial evaluation, consistent with RL1.

 3:新城区房子确实很多，都是高层和超高层为主，人口密度就高，堵车就成为家常，比如月亮岛和梅溪湖等主干道区域，而老长沙反而没有那么堵，因为有很多6层楼的单位房，密度低些，就业也在附近
 4:新城区外表看起来都是高楼大厦，却缺少了老长沙特有文化的烟火气，除了就业情况和湖南省内地级市不同和其他城市没啥区别

- 伍家岭
- 南二环
- 月亮岛
- 梅溪湖
- 老长沙
- 新城区
- 长沙

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 伍家岭 to 南二环: Defined as the boundary for the ""from small grown-up place"" and ""not recognizing other places as local"" — implies a spatial boundary of local identity.
- 老长沙 vs 新城区: Old area has less congestion due to lower density, more cultural atmosphere (""烟火气""), new districts have high-rise buildings but lack local culture.
- Cultural recognition is emphasized: ""从心里认可这个城市就必须移植到大脑的文化里"" — recognizing local culture as a core standard.
- Emphasis on ""完善便捷的配套"" (well-developed supporting facilities) as important for feeling local.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- Point 1 clearly reflects RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority — defines local area boundary from 伍家岭 to 南二环, and internal emotional recognition of that area as local, dismissing others as ""乡下"".
- Point 4 and 5 emphasize local cultural atmosphere and internalized cultural recognition as necessary to feel local — this corresponds to RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- Point 5 also emphasizes well-developed infrastructure and convenience as key to feeling local — this corresponds to RL5: Functional Livability.

我只是发表个人感受，我住了3年梅溪湖，然后我老公就吐槽了三年，然后在房价没跌的时候果断卖掉了,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 梅溪湖 (Meixi Lake)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to Meixi Lake: The author says they have lived in Meixi Lake for 3 years, and their husband complained for 3 years. They sold the property decisively before the house price fell.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The author mentions duration of residence (""我住了3年梅溪湖""), which may relate to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) but here it's only 3 years and no generational or ancestral mention.

- The husband's complaint and selling the house are about property value and personal feelings, but no explicit or implicit claim that these factors define ""local person"" identity.

- The text is about personal feelings and property decisions, not about defining who is a local person.

Therefore, no recognition logic applies here.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 北辰: liked by the author because it is a transition area between old and new city, streets are less dilapidated than old city, close to city center (about ten minutes), has complete amenities, and is comfortable to live in.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author evaluates 北辰 as a ""local"" area based on its livability factors: street condition, proximity to city center, completeness of supporting facilities, and comfort of living. This aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of old city and new city as distinct spatial areas may imply a vernacular spatial classification, but the author does not explicitly define local identity based on these boundaries, rather on comfort and convenience.

- 长沙: The author compares Changsha's size with other provincial capitals and notes that their personal standard for spatial distance (defining local area) is different from other cities.
- 武汉: Mentioned as a reference point for a relative unfamiliar with Changsha's boundaries, indicating local spatial knowledge.
- 侯家塘 to 步行街: The author’s childhood perception of the furthest ""local"" distance.
- 河西: The author notes it is far from home, despite liking the environment.
- 黄鹤楼: Sister lives nearby but it takes a 30 RMB taxi ride, implying it is not ""close"" in the author's perception.
- ""我的附近是能双脚到达"": The author defines ""nearby"" as within walking distance, indicating a personal/local spatial boundary.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is expressing a spatial boundary and local cognitive map based on personal and collective perception of distance and familiarity within Changsha. This is not based on administrative boundaries or family roots, but on habitual spatial experience and emotional sense of proximity.
- The emphasis on ""nearby"" being walkable, and the contrast with other areas perceived as ""too far,"" shows the author uses vernacular spatial authority to define what counts as ""local.""

- The author's parents say that by moving to 梅溪湖, the author has ""gone to the countryside,"" described as a ""bird-shitting nowhere"" place (an expression implying a remote or undesirable area).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The parents' comment implies a spatial classification of places based on local perceptions and emotional evaluation of urban vs. rural or central vs. peripheral areas.
- The author mentions birthplace and growth place, implying a family root or growth history standard.
- The parents' remark highlights a vernacular spatial authority view that countryside is not considered truly ""local"" or desirable.
- The author does not explicitly oppose this logic; the narrative suggests the importance of birthplace and living place in defining local identity.
- Therefore, RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) is present due to the spatial judgment and labeling of areas.
- RL3 (Family Rootedness) is present because the author emphasizes birthplace and growing up place as identity markers.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 老城区: The author questions the naming of 老城区 as the ""old city district,"" implying some skepticism about the boundary or recognition of this area.
- 侯家塘: The author asks whether Houjiatang counts as part of the old city district.
- 天剑路: The author points out that living conditions around Tianjian Road may not be very comfortable, challenging any assumed superiority or positive image of the old city district, especially the claim that 老城区 is not congested.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is questioning or discussing the spatial boundary or classification of local areas (whether Houjiatang is counted as part of the old city district), and challenging the perceived qualities associated with that area.
- This relates to how locals perceive the scope of the ""old city district"" and what areas are considered ""core"" or ""local"" within the city.
- The critique about congestion and comfort challenges the assumed positive image of the old city district but does not necessarily define local identity by these qualities.
- The focus is on spatial boundaries and collective perception of local areas rather than administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, or social embeddedness.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) fits because the author is discussing the classification and perceived boundaries of local areas.

- 天心区 is considered the only real urban area (""只有天心区算城区"").
- Other districts like 雨花区, 开福区, 岳麓区, 跳马, 望城 are considered rural or ""乡里别"" (countryside), ""荒郊野地"" (wilderness), or not really urban/local.
- The husband, a native of 坡子街 (an old street in Tianxin), says that only 坡子街 counts as the old city center.
- The author uses the husband's local knowledge to assert these spatial distinctions.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author (and husband) define ""local"" or ""urban"" identity primarily based on spatial authority rooted in vernacular perceptions of which areas count as the core city or old city center, and which are considered peripheral or rural.
- This is a classic example of RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author relies on local historical and collective perceptions about the spatial hierarchy of districts.
- No explicit mention of administrative boundaries or hukou.
- No mention of family roots as the standard beyond the husband being ""土生土长"" (native born) from Pozi Street, but this is a supporting fact, not the main standard.
- No mention of dialect, cultural habits, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as defining standards.

Output: RL1"
小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，然后去了捞刀河，接着又住到暮云，最后住到了梅溪湖，变成了xlb 哈哈哈哈哈哈,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 南门口 (Nanmenkou)
- 八角亭 (Bajiaoting)
- 捞刀河 (Laodahe)
- 暮云 (Muyun)
- 梅溪湖 (Meixihu)
- xlb (a nickname or self-identifier)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
The author recounts their childhood and growth history by listing the sequence of places they lived: Nanmenkou, Bajiaoting, Laodahe, Muyun, Meixihu. The final statement ""变成了xlb"" (""became xlb"") is a humorous self-label or identity. The sequence suggests that the author defines their identity partly through the places they lived over time.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the sequence of places they lived from childhood to adulthood to define their identity.
- This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History), emphasizing ""born and raised,"" or growth history as a basis for local identity.
- There is no explicit or implicit reference to administrative legitimacy, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, vernacular spatial authority, or livability standards.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL3"
哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities  
- No specific named entities mentioned; the text uses general terms ""乡里别"" (rural people) and ""城里人"" (city people).

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author distinguishes between ""乡里别"" and ""城里人,"" implying a distinction between rural and urban locals.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The author uses a spatial or social boundary to define ""local person"" identity: the contrast between rural and urban identity.  
- This is a form of vernacular spatial authority, as it distinguishes identity based on local spatial categories (""乡里"" vs ""城里"").  
- The text does not mention administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.  
- The key logic is that ""local person"" identity is defined by belonging to the city (城里人) rather than the countryside (乡里别), which is a spatial/cultural boundary commonly recognized in local perception.

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL1"
我在五一广场 有个同事不知道我们经理就是那个月亮岛那里的，然后他就说乡里别 然后我们经理就说那里已经属于是开发区了，不属于是乡里了，然后我同事还没理解意思，一直在吐槽那里不好不好，结果我们经理就背后面针对他，懂得都懂,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- 五一广场  
- 月亮岛  
- 经理  
- 同事  
- 开发区  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:  
- 经理: points out that 月亮岛 已经属于开发区了，不属于乡里了.  
- 同事: calls 月亮岛 ""乡里别"" and criticizes it as ""不好"".  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The manager uses administrative division (""属于开发区了，不属于乡里了"") to define or distinguish local identity or area classification. This corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).  
- The colleague's use of ""乡里别"" implies a vernacular spatial perception of the area as rural or non-urban, which is opposed by the manager's administrative claim. The manager's assertion implies that the administrative status is the legitimate standard, thus rejecting the vernacular spatial logic. Therefore, the author sides with the administrative legitimacy logic.  
- The text does not indicate that the author endorses the vernacular spatial authority as a standard, but rather presents it as a mistaken view.  
- No other recognition logics are clearly endorsed by the author.  

Output: RL2"
住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entity identified: 北正街

Step 2: The author states that those living in 北正街 are considered ""乡里别中的城里人"" (urban people among the rural neighborhood), implying a classification of local identity based on residence in a specific area.

Step 3: This classification relies on a vernacular spatial perception of local identity, using the location ""北正街"" as a marker for being a local urban person. The author implicitly uses a shared local understanding of spatial boundaries and local identity categories.

Step 4: The recognition logic corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Output: RL1"
