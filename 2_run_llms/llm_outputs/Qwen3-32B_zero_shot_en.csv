热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,"RL1, RL5"," - The author is expressing pride and optimism in the development potential of the area known as ""北门"" (North Gate) in the context of ""叙北"" (Xubei), and is asserting its superiority or future potential over other parts of the city (e.g., 东三环/西三环 = East/West 3rd Ring). The author is positioning this area as a rising or already valuable ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""咱叙北第一带盐人"" – implies a sense of local pride and identity, possibly a local cultural figure or representative.
  - ""北门可不差"" – suggests the area is considered a legitimate or even superior local area.
  - ""论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" – implies a comparison of regional value and superiority of the area in question.
  - ""再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了"" – implies the author believes the area will rise in value or status, possibly in terms of development or economic growth.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **using the area's name (""北门"") and its comparison to other areas (""东三环"", ""西三环"")** to establish a **regional identity and value**. This implies that the **area is recognized as a distinct and valuable part of the local identity**.
  - The author is **positively evaluating the area's current and future potential**, which suggests that the **area is considered a core part of the local identity** and its development is seen as a sign of local progress.
  - The author is **implicitly defending or promoting the area's status**, indicating that it **""counts"" as a real or even superior part of the local region**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **using regional naming (""北门"") and comparisons to other areas (""东三环"", ""西三环"")** to define what counts as a ""good"" or valuable local area.
  - The author is **implicitly endorsing the idea that the area is a core part of the local identity**, and its development will enhance its local status.
  - The author is **not merely describing a phenomenon or personal preference**, but is **using these to define or evaluate the area's local value**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **comparing the area (""北门"") to other parts of the city (""东三环"", ""西三环"")**, and **asserting its value or potential**, which aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  - The author is **using the idea of the area's development (""火北弄好"") to suggest its rising value**, which can be seen as part of **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as it implies that the area will become a better or more desirable local area in terms of development and livability.

真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL4"," The author is describing their experience of being from the outskirts of Chengdu and encountering prejudice or exclusion from Chengdu ""natives"" (土著). They feel that the Chengdu ""core"" (especially within the second ring road) defines itself as the only ""real"" Chengdu, and that people from the outskirts are often mocked for their accents, background, or perceived provincial status. The author is clearly critical of this exclusionary logic and is highlighting how Chengdu ""natives"" define who is ""local"" and who is not, often through territorial, cultural, and identity-based criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author is from the outskirts of Chengdu.
  - ""土著"" (natives) are defined by those within the second ring road.
  - There is a contrast between ""Chengdu"" and ""Sichuan"" for people outside the second ring.
  - Accents and dialects are used to mock or distinguish locals from outsiders.
  - There is a distinction between ""central Chengdu"" and ""peripheral Chengdu"" in terms of identity.
  - People from the center claim not to require dowries, while those from the periphery do.
  - The author experiences exclusion based on perceived regional identity and accent.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the contrast between ""core Chengdu"" and ""peripheral Chengdu"" to highlight how locals define themselves territorially.
  - Accent and dialect are used as tools of social exclusion, indicating a cultural-linguistic boundary.
  - The author is implicitly criticizing the logic that only those from the central ring road are ""real"" Chengdu people.
  - The author is pointing out that people from the center often look down on those from the outskirts, using identity markers like accent and dowry practices to reinforce this hierarchy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly critiques the territorial definition of Chengdu as only the inner ring.
  - The author highlights the cultural-linguistic exclusion based on accent and dialect.
  - The author is not endorsing the criteria used by the ""core Chengdu"" people, but is pointing out that they are being used to define ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author discusses how ""core Chengdu"" (within the second ring) is seen as the real Chengdu, and those outside are considered outsiders. This reflects a socially conventional territorial identity where certain areas are privileged in terms of identity.
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author experiences and describes how people mock outsiders for their accents, which is a clear example of using cultural-linguistic markers to define who is ""local.""

The core intent is to express how their **local identity** (from Dujiangyan) is **differentiated or questioned** by Chengdu locals due to **linguistic and cultural differences**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions being from Dujiangyan (a local identity), being mocked for their accent, being unable to speak freely in Chengdu, and having to use Mandarin in public.
  * These elements point to **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** and possibly **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The **accents and linguistic differences** are used by Chengdu locals to mock the author, implying that **not speaking the local dialect is a marker of being non-local or less accepted**.
  * The **author’s regional identity (Dujiangyan) is contrasted with Chengdu locals**, suggesting a **socially conventional boundary between regions**.
  * The **author’s self-consciousness and adaptation behavior (using Mandarin)** reflect the **social stigma attached to non-local linguistic traits**, reinforcing the idea that **language is a key marker of local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly endorses the idea that **speaking with a local accent is a key marker of local identity**, and that **not speaking the local dialect leads to social exclusion or mockery**.
  * The author also implicitly conveys that **Dujiangyan and Chengdu are perceived as different localities with different cultural and linguistic norms**, contributing to a **socially conventional territorial identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author’s experience of being mocked for their accent and adapting to speak Mandarin shows that **language and accent are used to judge whether someone is a ""local"" or not**.
  * **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author’s identity as being from Dujiangyan, and the contrast with Chengdu locals, reflects a **socially accepted boundary between regions** and how identity is tied to **regional linguistic and cultural norms**.

那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,"RL1, RL4"," The author expresses discomfort and aversion toward someone from Chengdu who constantly emphasizes their local heritage (e.g., living in the old city area, near the Wannian Temple, etc.) in a self-aggrandizing manner. The author feels that this person is using cultural and territorial identity as a status symbol and a way to elevate themselves, which the author finds annoying and pretentious.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ""都江堰话"" (Dujiangyan dialect) as a marker of identity.
  - The Chengdu person emphasizes their roots in ""二环以内"" (within the second ring road) and ""宽窄巷子"" (Kuanzhai Alley), which are culturally and historically significant areas in Chengdu.
  - The Chengdu person is described as ""装b"" (showing off), implying the author views their behavior as inauthentic or performative.
  - The author's own dialect (Dujiangyan) is mentioned as being met with mockery.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author implicitly accepts that **language/dialect** and **historical/cultural area of residence** are used as markers of ""local identity.""
  - The author critiques the Chengdu person for using these markers in a performative and inauthentic way, but this still indicates that the author **recognizes the importance of these markers in defining local identity.**
  - The author's own identity is tied to speaking a local dialect, even though it is met with mockery, which suggests the author **implicitly accepts dialect as a criterion** for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly accepts** that speaking a local dialect (RL4) is a marker of local identity.
  - The author **implicitly accepts** that being from a historically or culturally significant area (RL1) is used to define local identity, even though they criticize the performative use of it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is relevant because the author critiques someone for emphasizing their connection to specific historically significant areas in Chengdu as a way to assert local identity.
  - **RL4** is relevant because the author is tied to the Dujiangyan dialect and implies that it is part of local identity, even if it is mocked.

They seem to be defending or emphasizing the value of **local regional identity** by criticizing Chengdu residents for **discriminating against others** and **mocking their dialect**. The author also questions the **need to imitate Chengdu's dialect** and advocates for **preserving one's own local dialect or regional identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Chengdu dialect (""成都话"")
  - Discrimination (""歧视本省的人"")
  - Accent features (""儿化音"", ""怪音"", ""大舌头"")
  - Imitation of Chengdu accent by people from other districts (""模仿他们的口音"")
  - Advocacy for maintaining one's own local dialect (""保持自己的地方本土特色"")

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **uses Chengdu dialect and its perceived flaws as a marker of local identity**, which they **contrast with the identity of people from other regions**.
  - The **discrimination** mentioned implies that Chengdu locals use **cultural-linguistic criteria** to distinguish between ""us"" and ""them"".
  - The **author criticizes the imitation of Chengdu accent**, suggesting that the **Chengdu dialect has symbolic value as a local identity marker**, and that imitating it is a form of **loss of self-identity or insecurity**.
  - The **advocacy for preserving one's own dialect** implies a **positive view of regional identity** and the **importance of cultural-linguistic distinctiveness** in defining ""localness"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The **Chengdu dialect and its features** are used by the author to **represent the local identity of Chengdu residents**, even if in a **critical way**.
  - The **criticism of discrimination** implies that the **author opposes using dialect as a basis for exclusion**, but also **affirms the dialect as a cultural-linguistic marker of identity**.
  - The **author values maintaining one's own local dialect** as a **symbol of regional identity**, suggesting that **linguistic distinctiveness is important for defining local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** to define and critique the Chengdu local identity. They imply that **Chengdu locals use their dialect and accent to assert or enforce their identity**, and that **non-Chengdu people imitate the dialect as a way of trying to fit in**, which the author sees as a **loss of one's own local identity**.

  - The friend has lived in Chengdu for over 10 years.
  - The friend now has a Chengdu accent.
  - The author speculates that the friend changed her accent to integrate.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the friend's change in accent as a marker of integration into Chengdu society.
  - The speculation about the friend's motivation (fear of not being able to integrate) suggests that **cultural-linguistic adaptation is seen as a way to become ""local""**.
  - The author implies that **adopting a local accent is a sign of becoming part of the local group**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

我也都江堰的，被别个说口音难听,RL4," * The author expresses that they are from Dujiangyan and are being told that their accent is unattractive. The tone suggests a sense of identity tied to their place of origin and possibly a subtle resistance or sensitivity to being judged based on their accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我也都江堰的"" indicates the author identifies with being from Dujiangyan.
  * ""被别个说口音难听"" suggests that the author is being judged or criticized based on their accent.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The statement implies that the author sees their regional identity as tied to their accent.
  * The mention of being judged by accent suggests that the author believes accent is a relevant or sensitive factor in how they are perceived as a ""local"" or outsider.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly defining who is ""local,"" but the context implies that the author sees their own identity as rooted in their regional origin and accent.
  * The statement implies that accent is used by others to judge or label the speaker, which aligns with the idea of cultural-linguistic recognition as a marker of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The statement aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it involves the speaker's accent being used (by others) to judge or label them, which is a criterion tied to cultural-linguistic identity.

哈哈哈 真的 确实 因为以前的周边的确实很弯 一说话就嫌弃 其实现在也一样 土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显 但对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走,RL4," - The author is discussing how people from the core area of Chengdu (一环内的) have a distinct accent that is recognizable to locals. They also mention that although locals may have a clear sense of identity (and possibly some subtle in-group/out-group distinctions), they are still very welcoming and helpful to outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显"" — suggests a linguistic marker for identifying locals.
  - ""其实现在也一样"" — implies that this distinction is ongoing and still relevant.
  - ""对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走"" — shows a contrast between identity-based recognition and social behavior toward outsiders.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase about accent (""口音明显"") is used to define a **linguistic marker** for identifying locals, which is a **key indicator of in-group identity**.
  - The author does not resist or negate this marker; rather, they acknowledge it as a **shared understanding among locals**.
  - The contrast with the author’s observation about locals being helpful to outsiders is **not used to define ""local identity""**, but rather to highlight a behavioral trait, so it is **not relevant for annotation**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The **linguistic marker (accent)** is used as a **basis for distinguishing locals**, and this is **explicitly acknowledged and endorsed** by the author.
  - The author does **not resist** this marker, and the marker is **used to define who is ""local""** in their view.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author explicitly acknowledges that a **distinct local accent** is a **recognizable marker of local identity**, especially among Chengdu's inner ring (一环内的) residents.
  - This matches the **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** category, where **language and accent are used to determine who is ""one of us""**.

They assert that **having ability and confidence is more important than where one is from or how one speaks**. They reject the idea that local identity should be defined by dialect or place of origin, and dismiss those who value such superficial traits.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions being from Neijiang (a city near Zigong), having a ""pure Zigong accent"", living in Chengdu for over a decade, and owning property in the first ring of Chengdu. These elements could relate to RL1 (territorial identity), RL4 (cultural-linguistic recognition), or RL6 (economic status symbolism). However, the author does not use these to define or evaluate ""local identity"" but rather to **reject** such criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **Zigong accent** and **place of origin** as examples of **traits that should not be used to judge someone’s worth or identity**. The mention of owning a house in Chengdu might imply a form of rootedness, but the author **does not use it to claim local identity**. Instead, they argue that **ability and self-confidence** are more important than these traits.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria listed as standards for defining ""local identity"". Instead, they **reject** the idea that **accent (RL4)** or **origin (RL1)** should be used for such purposes. The author also does not use **property ownership (RL6)** as a basis for identity. The author's core argument is **against** using these as identity criteria, and thus they should **not be annotated**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **does not use any RL criteria to define ""local identity""**. Instead, they **reject** the idea that accent, origin, or property ownership should be used for such a purpose. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable**.

**Output:**"
我不内耗我也不觉得我们口音不好听，我只是觉得有些成都人笑别人很无语,RL4," - The author is expressing disagreement with the behavior of some Chengdu locals who mock others for their accents. They are not engaging in self-doubt (""不内耗"") and do not find their own accent unattractive, but they find the mocking attitude of certain Chengdu residents to be unreasonable or annoying.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of accent (""口音"") implies a potential link to cultural or linguistic identity.
  - The phrase ""有些成都人"" (some Chengdu people) implies a reference to local identity, possibly based on regional or cultural criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of accent is used to contrast the author's own neutral or positive attitude with the negative behavior of some locals.
  - The reference to ""Chengdu people"" implies a shared regional and cultural identity, which is used to distinguish between those who belong and those who are judged based on their accent.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly accepts the idea that being a Chengdu person is tied to cultural or linguistic identity (e.g., accent).
  - The author implicitly rejects the idea that accent should be used to mock others, suggesting that being a local should not equate to exclusion or ridicule.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The reference to accent and the implicit judgment of ""Chengdu people"" aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is referencing the use of accent as a marker of local identity.
  - The author's disapproval of mocking others based on accent suggests a critique of how local identity is used to exclude others, but this does not represent a standard they themselves endorse for defining local identity.

你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,RL4," * The author is responding to a statement or comment that criticized their accent, suggesting that it was looked down upon. The author is defending their identity and possibly expressing a sense of pride or resistance against being judged for their accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of ""口音"" (accent) is a direct reference to a linguistic or cultural marker.
  * The phrase ""说我们口音很贱"" (saying our accent is cheap) implies that the speaker is being judged or excluded based on their accent.
  * This is likely tied to a broader theme of defining who is considered ""local"" or part of the in-group based on linguistic markers.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to accent is used to highlight how the author is being judged or excluded by others, likely based on cultural or linguistic differences.
  * The author is implying that their accent is a marker of their identity, and that being judged for it is a form of social exclusion or discrimination.
  * The author's attitude is defensive and possibly resentful, indicating that they believe the criteria used to judge them (accent) is unjust or irrelevant to defining who is a ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly implying that being judged based on accent is a form of social exclusion, and that they themselves do not accept this as a valid criterion for defining who is or is not a local.
  * However, the author is also implicitly suggesting that accent **can be used as a marker** to distinguish between locals and non-locals — even if they are resisting the negative judgment of their own accent.
  * Therefore, the author is not rejecting the idea that accent is a relevant marker of local identity, but is instead rejecting the negative judgment or stigma attached to their own.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The mention of ""口音"" (accent) and the implication that it is being used to judge or exclude the author aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  * The author is responding to a form of judgment that uses accent as a criterion for determining who is or is not ""one of us"" or ""local"".
  * The author's own stance is that they do not accept being judged negatively for their accent, but they do not deny that accent is a commonly used marker of local identity.

The mention of a colleague from Dazhou claiming to speak ""authentic Chengdu dialect"" suggests a discussion of **how local identity is defined or claimed through linguistic features**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is ""口音才是正宗成都话"" (his accent is the authentic Chengdu dialect), which relates to **language and dialect** as a marker of identity.
  * The author's colleague is **asserting a claim to local authenticity** based on linguistic criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is not directly claiming to be a local or defending a definition of local identity, but is **presenting and commenting on someone else's claim** that linguistic features define ""authentic local identity"".
  * The author's tone (""哈哈，就是"") suggests **acknowledgment or agreement**, indicating that **the author implicitly supports or accepts this logic** as a way to define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

RL4"," * The author uses the phrase “口音很贱” (""accent is cheap"") in a humorous tone. However, the mention of ""accent"" implies a judgment or perception about someone's linguistic background, potentially relating to whether they are seen as ""local"" or not. The author is likely mocking or commenting on the perceived social value or authenticity of a certain accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “口音” (accent), which is a core element in **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author implies that a certain accent is ""cheap,"" suggesting a negative evaluation of the speaker's identity or background. This may indicate that the author sees accents as a marker of authenticity or social value, and by mocking the accent, they are subtly affirming a standard for what constitutes a ""real local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using the accent as a marker of identity, and the comment implies a judgment about whether someone fits into the ""local"" group based on linguistic traits. This aligns with **RL4**.

The author seems to be emphasizing **language/cultural traits** as a key marker of being ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions:
    - ""几套房子"" (how many houses) — material possession.
    - ""房子在哪"" (where the house is) — location, possibly related to RL1 or RL5.
    - ""是不是老破小"" (whether it's old and run-down) — condition of housing, possibly RL5.
    - ""带不带口音"" (whether one has an accent) — directly related to RL4.
    - ""口音改不到撒"" (you can't change an accent) — implies that accent is an **inherent and unchangeable trait**, which **defines one's identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author **downplays** the importance of housing (number, location, condition), suggesting these are **superficial or external markers**.
  * The author **highlights** the **inherent nature of accent** as something that **cannot be changed**, and thus, **defines one's local identity**.
  * The function of the **accent** here is to **distinguish who is authentically local**, based on **language and cultural traits**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The **only RL criterion** clearly used by the author to define ""local identity"" is **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author **explicitly emphasizes** that **having a local accent is a key and unchangeable marker** of being ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **does not use** administrative, territorial, or economic criteria to define ""local identity.""
  * The author **does use** the **presence of a local accent** as a **key marker of local identity**, and **emphasizes that it is unchangeable**, implying it is **deeply rooted in one's cultural background**.

  - ""骂成都口音难听"" (mocking the Chengdu accent as unattractive): implies a cultural or linguistic identity marker.
  - The rhetorical question ""逼着他来成都了？"" (Why force them to come to Chengdu?) implies that the speaker sees the Chengdu accent as a natural and unchangeable part of local identity, and that outsiders should not be forced to conform.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ""骂成都口音难听"" implies that the Chengdu accent is a marker of local identity, and that outsiders are judged or criticized for not conforming to this linguistic standard.
  - The rhetorical question suggests that the speaker views the Chengdu accent as intrinsic to the local identity and that outsiders should not be forced to adopt it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The speaker implicitly defends the Chengdu accent and its role in defining local identity.
  - The speaker implies that the Chengdu accent is a cultural marker used to distinguish locals from outsiders.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The speaker uses the Chengdu accent as a marker of local identity and implies that outsiders are judged for not conforming to this standard.
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the speaker is referencing the Chengdu accent as a key marker of local identity and implicitly suggesting that outsiders are not part of the local group if they do not conform to it.

我也不知道我算不算成都人，爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都，我户口在成都。但是妈妈是外地人，我爸妈都在我妈妈的城市工作。从小我跟着爸妈在我妈妈出生的城市生活，小时候放假回成都，和小朋友玩要被骂乡巴佬，所以导致我小时候不愿意回成都，一直到读研才回的成都，读完研就出国了，现在回成都快3年，不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话，总被同事说我说的四川话有口音，我也一直对成都没有认同感。,"RL3, RL4"," * The author is reflecting on their complex relationship with the identity of being a ""Chengdu person"" (local). They describe their mixed background—having a Chengdu-born father and grandparents, but growing up in a different city with a non-local mother. The author feels a lack of cultural and linguistic connection to Chengdu, which has led to a lack of identity and belonging in the city, despite legal and familial ties.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Family background (father and grandparents from Chengdu)
  * Hukou (户口) in Chengdu
  * Childhood experience in a different city
  * Linguistic experience (understands Chengdu dialect but doesn't speak it fluently; speaks with an accent)
  * Cultural experience (being mocked as ""乡巴佬"" when in Chengdu as a child)
  * Lack of emotional or cultural connection to Chengdu

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author **explicitly mentions** their **family's historical rootedness in Chengdu**, but also **emphasizes** that they **did not grow up in Chengdu**, which **undermines** their claim to a local identity.
  * The **hukou** is **mentioned**, but it is **not central** to the author's sense of identity.
  * The **linguistic and cultural disconnection** (e.g., being mocked for being ""rural"", speaking with an accent) is **central** to the author's **lack of identity with Chengdu**.
  * The **author implicitly defines** ""local identity"" as involving **cultural familiarity and linguistic fluency**, **not just family background or legal status**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly rejects** the idea that **hukou or family background alone** defines one as a ""local.""
  * The author **implicitly defines** local identity through **cultural familiarity**, **linguistic fluency**, and **emotional connection**.
  * The **lack of linguistic fluency and cultural belonging** is **used by the author as a standard** to **negate their own local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is **mentioned**, but the author **does not endorse it as sufficient** for defining local identity.
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is **strongly implied as a defining criterion** for the author—**fluency in the local language and cultural familiarity** are **central to the author’s sense of being or not being a local**.
  * **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is **mentioned (户口)**, but the author **does not treat it as a defining criterion** for local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3, RL4"
一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,RL4," * The author is expressing frustration and distress over being subjected to online harassment (""网暴"") due to their accent (""一个口音"") and appearance (""一个面""). They feel so targeted that they are afraid to leave home. The key issue is how being judged based on accent and appearance leads to social exclusion and harassment.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""一个口音"" (an accent) and ""一个面"" (a face/appearance), both of which are potential markers of identity.
  * The author is being targeted due to these features, suggesting that they are being judged as outsiders or not belonging due to these characteristics.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The accent and appearance are not just physical traits but are being used by others to attack or ostracize the author.
  * The author implies that these traits are being used to determine whether someone is ""one of us"" or an outsider, which aligns with the idea of identity-based social segregation.
  * The author is not directly defining what a ""local"" is, but the implication is that their accent and appearance are being used by others to judge their local status or belonging.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly defining ""local identity,"" but the text implies that accent and appearance are being used as criteria to judge whether someone is a local or not.
  * This aligns with the idea of using cultural or linguistic traits to determine insider/outsider status, which is central to RL4.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is being targeted for harassment because of their accent and appearance, which are being used by others to judge their local status or belonging. This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, where accent is a key criterion for determining insider/outsider status.

RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a preference for people not staying in a city (Chengdu) for undesirable purposes (e.g., making telemarketing or scam calls), and implies that those who do such things are not ""local"" in a desirable or authentic sense. They are not explicitly defining ""local identity"" but are **implying a contrast** between ""outsiders"" (by accent and behavior) and the implied ""locals"" who are not involved in such activities.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""外地口音"" (foreign accent) → may relate to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
  - ""他们回老家，做点其他工作"" (they return to their hometowns and do other work) → implies a contrast between staying in Chengdu and being from elsewhere, possibly referencing **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**
  - The author implies that people from elsewhere should not be in Chengdu for undesirable purposes, suggesting a **value judgment** about who belongs in the city and who does not, possibly touching on **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to ""外地口音"" is used to **distinguish outsiders**, but not in a way that defines ""local identity"" per se—more as a **symbol of outsider status**.
  - The suggestion that ""they should go back to their hometowns and do other work"" implies that **being from a place** (hometown) is a more legitimate or appropriate status than being an outsider in Chengdu. This **touches on RL3**, as it implies a **connection to one's origin** as a better or more legitimate status.
  - The author is **not defining ""local people""**, but is **implying a value judgment** about who should be in Chengdu and for what purpose, which **touches on RL1**, as it suggests a **territorial identity** where undesirable behaviors are associated with outsiders.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL4** is **not strongly endorsed**, as the accent is only used as a **marker of outsider status**, not a **criterion for being local**.
  - **RL3** is **implied** in the idea that people should be in their hometowns doing ""other work"", suggesting that **being rooted in one's origin** is more legitimate.
  - **RL1** is **implied** in the **territorial framing** of who should be where, and the **value judgment** about undesirable behaviors being associated with outsiders.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author **implicitly implies** that people who are **rooted in their hometowns** (RL3) are in a more legitimate position, and that undesirable people (by behavior and accent) are **outsiders who do not belong in Chengdu** (RL1). The **accent** is a **symbol of outsider status** but not a **defining criterion** for being local.

The author questions the legitimacy of this claim and criticizes the behavior of pretending to be a local for perceived social status.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author criticizes people who are not ""native"" Chengdu people but claim to be locals.
  - The author notes that these people's only connection is that ""relatives in Shuangliu bought a house.""
  - The author implies that ""being born and raised in Chengdu"" is the real basis for being a local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **rejects** the idea that owning property in a local area (Shuangliu) or having relatives who do equates to being a local.
  - The author **endorses** the idea that being a local is about **being born and raised in the area**, not about economic or familial connections to property.
  - The author **implicitly judges** the legitimacy of local identity based on **historical rootedness** and **authenticity of origin**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly values **being born and raised in Chengdu** as a defining feature of being a ""true local.""
  - The author **rejects** the idea that **property ownership** or **familial ties to property** are sufficient for local identity.
  - The author's core argument is about **authenticity of local identity**, based on **historical rootedness and personal growth history**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's emphasis on ""being born and raised in Chengdu"" aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - The author’s rejection of property-based local identity implies a **rejection of RL6**, but since the author **does not endorse** this, it is not annotated.
  - The author's frustration is directed at **inauthentic local identity claims**, which are contrasted with the authentic kind (RL3).

The author expresses a mix of mockery and observation about how this person behaves differently when around others who are not ""natives.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都本地人"" (Chengdu local) is a key term.
  - The person claims to be a ""local"" due to buying property in Chengdu and having a Chengdu hukou.
  - The author notes that this person only claims to be a local when around non-natives, suggesting a situational or performative use of identity.
  - The behavior of ""吹嘘"" (bragging) and ""神戳戳的"" (self-important) indicates a social or status-based motivation.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is observing and mocking the idea that someone can claim to be a ""local"" simply by acquiring property and a hukou, and that this identity is used strategically.
  - The author implies that ""local"" identity is not just about legal status or property, but also about being a ""native"" or ""土著"" (indigenous to the area).
  - The author's tone suggests that the person's new status is not genuinely accepted by others and is only asserted in certain social contexts.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that being a ""native"" (土著) is a more legitimate basis for local identity than merely acquiring a hukou or property.
  - The author implicitly critiques the idea that economic status or property ownership alone can grant local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The author mentions the person has a Chengdu hukou, which is used as a basis for claiming local identity.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author implies that ""natives"" (土著) have a more legitimate or socially accepted claim to being ""local,"" suggesting a socially conventional or historically rooted definition of local identity.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author critiques the idea that owning property or having economic success alone makes someone a ""local,"" implying that deeper social roots (being a native) are more important for authentic local identity.

They feel that places that are now considered part of Chengdu are too far from the city center and do not align with how older generations (like their parents) traditionally understood Chengdu. The author implies that this change has caused confusion and a sense of alienation among older people, and they hint at a form of ""discrimination"" against outsiders or those who don't conform to the old definitions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of ""老一辈"" (older generations) and their difficulty in adapting to the new definition of Chengdu.
  - Reference to the expansion of Chengdu and the inclusion of areas that are now considered part of Chengdu but are geographically distant from the city center.
  - Use of ""原来的某某地名"" (original place names) as a contrast to the new territorial expansion.
  - Implied sense of identity and belonging tied to traditional or long-standing definitions of the city.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the difficulty of older generations in accepting the expanded definition of Chengdu to highlight a shift in what is considered ""local"".
  - The reference to traditional place names and the distance from the city center is used to contrast with the new, expanded Chengdu, implying a loss of clarity or authenticity in defining ""local"".
  - The author's frustration with the change suggests that they implicitly endorse a more traditional or historically rooted understanding of Chengdu as a basis for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses a **historically rooted** and **emotionally meaningful** understanding of Chengdu as the basis for local identity.
  - They also implicitly define the **core area of Chengdu** in contrast to newly incorporated areas, which aligns with the idea of **territorial identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that older generations define ""local"" based on **long-standing social and emotional attachments to traditional areas and place names** (RL1).
  - The author also implies that the **expansion of Chengdu** has led to confusion and a sense of alienation, suggesting that the **traditional territorial boundaries** are more meaningful in defining ""local"" (RL1).
  - There is no clear endorsement of administrative, cultural-linguistic, economic, or occupational criteria in this text.

They argue that being a local does not equate to being rich and that locals are content with their lifestyle, which is based on stable housing and low living costs. The author emphasizes a sense of contentment and social harmony among locals, and suggests that wealthier individuals in the city are mostly outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土著"" (indigenous locals) is used multiple times.
  * ""不愁房子住"" (not worried about housing) and ""有多余的房子可以出租"" (have extra houses to rent out) imply a stable housing situation.
  * ""工资那么低很多人还是过得很开心"" (many people live happily even with low salaries) suggests a low-cost lifestyle.
  * ""成都人天生一副你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕各过各的谁也不碍着谁"" (Chengdu people naturally don't care if you are rich, they don’t envy and live their own lives) reflects a cultural attitude of non-materialism.
  * ""那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的"" (those wealthy areas are not for locals) implies a distinction between local and non-local residents in terms of space and belonging.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the concept of being a ""local"" (土著) to define a group of people who are not necessarily wealthy but are content with their lifestyle due to stable housing and low living costs.
  * The attitude of Chengdu locals is portrayed as non-competitive and non-envious, which contributes to a sense of identity and social harmony.
  * The author implicitly suggests that wealthier areas are not for locals but for outsiders, which reinforces a sense of social and spatial segregation.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses the idea of **stable housing** and **low-cost living** as a defining feature of locals.
  * The **cultural attitude of non-materialism** and **social harmony** is emphasized as part of local identity.
  * The **spatial and social distinction** between locals and outsiders is also present.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author uses the term ""土著"" to refer to people who are rooted in the city and presumably grew up there, forming a core part of the local identity.
  * **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** – The author describes the low cost of living and stable housing as key factors in why locals can live happily with low wages, which reflects a functional livability standard for defining a ""good local"" area.
  * **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The non-competitive and content attitude of Chengdu locals is portrayed as a cultural trait that defines their local identity.

They emphasize how people from Chongzhou identify themselves as Chongzhou locals, not Chengdu locals, and note that even Chengdu residents often exclude areas beyond the third ring road from their concept of Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""Chongzhou"" as a distinct identity marker.
  * The author discusses how Chengdu residents often do not consider areas beyond the third ring as ""Chengdu"".
  * The author emphasizes the self-identification of people as ""Chongzhou people"", not ""Chengdu people"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are used to **highlight the author's and others' self-identification with Chongzhou** and the **distinction between Chongzhou and Chengdu**.
  * The author implies that **Chongzhou is not considered part of Chengdu by Chengdu residents**, reinforcing a territorial and administrative boundary as a basis for identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses **administrative and territorial boundaries** to define who is a local and which areas are considered part of the city.
  * The author's **own self-identification and the behavior of others** (identifying as Chongzhou, not Chengdu) supports the idea of **local identity being tied to smaller administrative units**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **administrative boundaries** and **regional self-identification** to define local identity, which aligns with **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.

They argue that only those whose families have lived in Chengdu since their grandparents' generation can be considered true locals. They contrast this with people who obtained Chengdu hukou from outside or whose parents moved there and settled, and they criticize these people for acting as if they are ""real Chengdu people"" when, in their view, they are not.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""从爷爷辈土生土长"" (born and raised here since the grandparents' generation) → indicates a generational or historical rootedness.
  - ""从外地拿到成都户口"" (obtained Chengdu hukou from outside) → administrative legitimacy.
  - ""父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃"" (children born to parents who moved in from elsewhere) → migration history and generational identity.
  - ""成都人假打90%以上都是这种人"" (over 90% of so-called Chengdu people are like this) → implies a social categorization or judgment of authenticity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses generational rootedness as a **defining criterion** for being a ""true Chengdu person.""
  - They **reject** administrative legitimacy (hukou) and migration history as valid markers of local identity.
  - The author is **explicitly endorsing** a definition of local identity based on **family historical rootedness** and **rejecting** administrative or recent migration-based claims to local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **strongly endorses** RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) as the criterion for being a ""true local.""
  - The author **rejects** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) and migration-based identity as valid for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that only those whose families have been born and raised in Chengdu since the grandparents' generation can be considered true locals. This aligns with **RL3**.
  - The author explicitly excludes people who obtained Chengdu hukou from elsewhere or were born to parents who moved there, which are **not endorsed** and are part of the author's **rejection** of administrative or recent migration-based claims to local identity.

The author is implying that being born and raised locally is a basis for a sense of belonging and identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The term ""土著"" and ""土生土长"" are used to refer to people who are born and raised in a local area.
  * The author suggests that this origin is a basis for a sense of superiority or identity.
  * This implies a value placed on birthplace and upbringing in defining who is a ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the idea of being ""born and raised in the local area"" to explain or justify a perceived sense of superiority among locals.
  * The author is not opposing this logic but is rather presenting it as a common or understandable phenomenon.
  * The phrase ""对吧"" suggests the author is aligning with this view or at least presenting it as a shared understanding.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is endorsing the idea that being ""born and raised locally"" is a significant basis for local identity.
  * The author is not resisting this logic but is instead implying it as a common or acceptable belief.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The concept of ""being born and raised locally"" is a key element of RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History.
  * The author is suggesting that this kind of rootedness is a legitimate basis for local identity, and perhaps even for a sense of superiority.
  * This aligns with the RL3 definition, which includes emphasis on ""born and raised here"" as a basis for local identity.

The author identifies as a ""natively born Chengdu girl"" and notes that they have no accent, reinforcing their deep connection to the local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" — indicates a deep personal connection to Chengdu.
  * ""一点口音都没有"" — suggests a cultural-linguistic integration.
  * The context of feeling ""亲切"" and unaffected by the heat implies a long-standing emotional and cultural connection to the region.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" serves to establish the author as a native of Chengdu, which is a key part of their self-identification as a local.
  * ""一点口音都没有"" reinforces the author's integration into the local culture, suggesting they are accepted as one of the locals.
  * The author's attitude is positive and affirming of their local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses their birth and upbringing in Chengdu as a basis for their local identity.
  * The author also uses the absence of an accent as a marker of local integration.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it refers to the author being born and raised in Chengdu.
  * ""一点口音都没有"" aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it refers to the author's lack of a non-local accent, which is used to affirm their local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * The RL elements used by the author to define their own local identity are clearly aligned with RL3 and RL4.

**Output:** RL3, RL4"
反正我三环外的不是成都人,RL1," * The author is expressing a belief that people living outside the Third Ring Road are not considered ""true Chengdu people"" (i.e., not local Chengdu people).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""三环外的不是成都人"" (people outside the Third Ring Road are not Chengdu people) suggests a **geographic boundary** is being used to define who qualifies as a ""local Chengdu person.""
  * The author implies that **residential location within the city (specifically, within the Third Ring Road)** is a key factor in determining local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) is used to **exclude people living in outer areas** from the identity of ""Chengdu people.""
  * The author's attitude is **assertive and exclusionary**, using the boundary of the Third Ring Road as a **defining line for local identity**.
  * This reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**, where the author **implicitly accepts** that being within a certain geographical boundary is essential to being considered a ""true local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses **geographical location** as a **defining standard for local identity**, which aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author does not mention administrative boundaries, cultural traits, historical roots, or economic status, so those categories are not relevant here.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that **people living outside the Third Ring Road are not considered true Chengdu people**, implying that **residential location within a certain boundary is essential to being considered a ""local.""**

Output: RL1"
我同学说二环外的都是农民,RL1," * The author is quoting a statement from a classmate that all people living outside the Second Ring Road are farmers. This reflects a perception or stereotype about people living in outer urban areas, likely implying a social or class distinction.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""二环外的都是农民"" (everyone outside the Second Ring Road is a farmer) implies a geographical boundary and a social identity linked to that boundary.
  * The statement uses **geographical location** to define a **social identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase suggests that people living outside a certain urban boundary are associated with a rural or lower social status.
  * The author's attitude appears to be neutral but is echoing a commonly held stereotype, potentially implying a **geographically based social hierarchy**.
  * The statement implicitly links **residence within a specific urban boundary** to **social class or identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly opposing the statement but is reporting it.
  * The **geographical boundary** (Second Ring Road) is used as a **criterion for defining a group** (farmers).
  * This reflects a **territorial-based identity** logic, where being ""local"" is defined by being within a certain area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author indirectly conveys that **residence inside or outside the Second Ring Road** is used to **define social identity or status**, implying a **territorial-based local identity logic**.

歧视三环外的多，还是学生偏多,N/A," - The text is a question: ""Which is more prevalent, discrimination against people outside the Third Ring Road, or the presence of students?"" The author is asking for a comparison between two social phenomena, but **does not explicitly or implicitly define or evaluate ""local identity""**. The question is more about **observing social dynamics** rather than asserting or defining what makes someone ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""Third Ring Road"" could be a geographical reference that might imply a **territorial boundary**, possibly related to RL1. However, the author does not provide any **judgment or standard** for determining who is or is not local based on this boundary.
  - There is a reference to ""students"", which could be a group, but no **criteria** are given for how this group is defined in terms of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ""Third Ring Road"" and ""students"" are **neutral descriptors**, not used as **standards for judging local identity**. The author is not asserting that people from outside the Third Ring Road are not local or that students are not local.
  - The author is not **constructing a definition of ""local""**, but is instead **raising a question about social perception**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - No **explicit or implicit criteria** for defining local identity are presented.
  - The text does not **serve the author's core argument** by establishing or endorsing any standard for judging who is or is not a local person.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author highlights how Chengdu's ""true locals"" define their identity and look down on others based on specific criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * - ""土著"" (indigenous locals), ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally), ""纯正血统"" (pure lineage) suggest **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  * - ""5城区成都人"" (5 core districts of Chengdu) and ""三环外但是大成都"" (beyond the 3rd ring road but still within Greater Chengdu) suggest **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  * - ""成都省护照"" (Chengdu province passport) implies **RL2** (Administrative Legitimacy).
  * - The author discusses a social hierarchy where certain groups are deemed ""worthy"" of being looked down upon, implying **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * - The use of ""土生土长"" and ""纯正血统"" supports the idea that **being born and raised locally is the foundation of ""true local"" identity**, aligning with **RL3**.
  * - The distinction between the ""5城区"" and ""三环外"" reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**, where the core districts are seen as the true center of Chengdu, aligning with **RL1**.
  * - The mention of ""成都省护照"" implies that **administrative or legal status (like a hukou or ID card) is used to distinguish ""new Chengdu locals""**, aligning with **RL2**.
  * - The author implies that **only those with deep roots or administrative legitimacy are ""worthy"" of being looked down upon**, suggesting a **hierarchy of local identity**, aligning with **RL6**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses the idea that ""true locals"" are those who are **born and raised in the core districts**, and that **newcomers or those from the outer regions** are not on the same level. These criteria are used to **define who is or is not a ""local"" and to establish social hierarchy**, so **RL1, RL2, RL3, and RL6** are all relevant.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses **RL1** to define the core area of Chengdu as the ""5城区"", which is seen as the real Chengdu and the source of local identity. 
  * The author uses **RL3** to emphasize that **only those born and raised in the core area** are considered ""true locals"", with a ""pure lineage"".
  * The author references **RL2** by implying that those with a ""Chengdu province passport"" (likely a metaphor for legal/hukou status) are **newcomers who have achieved local status**, but still not equal to the ""purebred locals"".
  * The author uses **RL6** to establish a **hierarchy of local identity**, where only those with a certain level of rootedness or status are **worthy of being looked down upon**, reinforcing the idea of **authenticity and social hierarchy** in local identity.

RL3"," * The author is a long-time resident of the Erhuan (2nd Ring Road) area in Chenghua District, and the statement conveys a sense of familiarity and indifference toward the area — they have lived there for decades and do not feel anything special about it. The core intent is to express a personal identity as a long-time local, but with no strong emotional or evaluative stance toward the area itself.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""成华区二环内土著"" (native of the Erhuan area in Chenghua District) is a key indicator. The word ""土著"" (native) directly refers to a long-time local or indigenous identity.
  * The phrase ""几十年了"" (for decades) suggests a long-standing presence in the area, which may imply historical rootedness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""成华区二环内土著"" is used to **define the author's own identity** as a long-time local of that specific area.
  * The phrase ""几十年了"" reinforces the idea that the author has a **deep-rooted connection** to the area.
  * However, the phrase ""没觉得啥子"" (don't feel anything special) suggests that the author does not use this identity to make value judgments or comparisons.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does** define themselves as a ""native"" of the Erhuan area in Chenghua District, which implies **historical rootedness** in the area.

  * The mention of ""口音"" (accent) relates to cultural-linguistic differences.
  * ""成都本地人也很多撇火药"" implies that Chengdu locals are generally not overly aggressive or exclusionary.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""我是成都土著"" functions as a self-identification that aligns with RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  * The mention of accents (""口音"") is a reference to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition), though it is not used as a strong or exclusive criterion for defining ""local identity.""
  * The author does not explicitly use these elements to define or exclude who is a ""local,"" but they do subtly reflect the author's perception of local identity and cultural boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The self-identification as a ""native"" of Chengdu (""土著"") is clearly used by the author to affirm their own local identity, aligning with RL3.
  * The reference to accents is not used as a strong or defining criterion for local identity, but rather as a minor cultural observation. It may imply a slight cultural-linguistic boundary, which could align with RL4, but only weakly and not as a defining standard.
  * There is no use of administrative, territorial, economic, or occupational criteria in the text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author is questioning the legitimacy or right of people from the outer (less central) parts of the city to judge or look down on others. The phrase ""bendy leg"" is likely a colloquial or derogatory term used to describe people from the outskirts. The author is challenging the social hierarchy or status attributed to people based on where they live.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""Third Ring"" implies a **geographical boundary** used to distinguish between ""core"" and ""non-core"" areas.
  * The use of ""bendy leg"" as a label suggests a **socially constructed identity or stereotype** based on geographical origin.
  * The rhetorical question implies that the author believes people from the outer areas should not be allowed to claim superiority or judge others based on their location.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to the ""Third Ring"" plays a central role in defining the **geographical boundary** between ""core"" and ""non-core"" areas, which is used to determine who is considered a ""local"" or who has the right to judge others.
  * The use of ""bendy leg"" implies a **socially conventional territorial identity** that is used to stigmatize or devalue people from the outskirts, which the author is challenging.
  * The rhetorical question suggests that the author **resists** the idea that people from outer areas can define or judge who is a ""real local"" based on location.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly rejects the idea that people from the outer areas (outside the Third Ring) can claim the authority to define who is a ""real local.""
  * The author **endorses** the idea that **geographical location** is a key factor in how ""local identity"" is constructed and how people are judged.
  * The author implicitly critiques the **socially conventional territorial identity** that assigns value or legitimacy based on location.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses the concept of the ""Third Ring"" as a **geographical boundary** that plays a central role in defining who is considered a ""local"" or who has the right to judge others. This is a clear example of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The phrase ""bendy leg"" and the rhetorical question suggest that the author is challenging the **socially constructed identity** that assigns value or legitimacy based on location, which is also aligned with **RL1**.

The author implies that even though ""inner-city natives"" may not discriminate against people from outside the city, they do discriminate against those from further out (三环外人). The core intent is to highlight how local identity is defined by **geographical boundaries and social hierarchy**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""土著"" (natives), ""市中心"" (city center), ""天府新区"" (Tianfu New Area), ""三环内"" (within the 3rd ring road), ""三环外人"" (people outside the 3rd ring road), and implies a social hierarchy based on these geographical distinctions.
  * The phrase ""不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人"" suggests a **value-based distinction** between ""outsiders"" and ""local outsiders"", indicating how identity is tied to **territorial boundaries and social inclusion/exclusion**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the geographical distinction between ""三环内"" and ""三环外"" to **justify or explain a form of local identity-based discrimination**. The author is not merely describing the move but is using it to **highlight a boundary that defines who is ""truly local""** and who is not.
  * The author's attitude is one of **acknowledging or implicitly endorsing** this form of local identity definition based on **geographical proximity and social status**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **geographical boundaries** (inner vs. outer city) to define who is ""local"" and who is not, which is a **territorial-based identity criterion**.
  * The author is also **implying that being from the inner city (三环内) confers a higher or more legitimate local identity**, while being from the outer areas (三环外) does not, which is a **socially conventional territorial identity** and may also touch on **social hierarchy and economic status symbolism**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's use of **geographical boundaries (inner vs. outer city)** and **socially accepted distinctions between areas** aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author is also **implying a social hierarchy based on where one is from**, which can be seen as a **form of economic or social status-based identity**, aligning with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

The key point is the **author's implicit commentary on how local identity is judged**, particularly through **residence, property, and hukou**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The husband **has a house in the 2nd ring**, implying a connection to the local area.
  - The husband's **hukou is from Qingbaijiang**, which is used by his relatives to label him as an outsider (""乡坝头"").
  - The relatives **use hukou and regional origin to judge and mock**, which reflects a **socially constructed boundary** of who is considered truly ""local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **author implicitly supports the idea that property and residence** (in a core area) can be seen as a sign of local identity.
  - The **author also highlights how hukou and regional origin are used to socially exclude or label someone as non-local**, indicating the **importance of administrative legitimacy and territorial identity** in defining local status.
  - The **author's tone suggests a critique of how local identity is socially constructed and used to exclude**, even when someone is physically and economically embedded in the area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses or implicitly accepts the idea that property in a core area** (2nd ring) is a criterion for local identity.
  - The author **endorses or highlights the use of hukou and regional origin** as a socially accepted boundary for defining ""local"" vs. ""non-local.""
  - The author **does not endorse the mocking behavior**, but **does highlight the logic behind it**, which is part of the socially conventional territorial identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is present because the author implies a **socially accepted territorial boundary** (2nd ring) and a **regional identity label** (""乡坝头"") that reflects the **social construction of local identity**.

The author feels a psychological or social boundary between themselves and the ""inner city"" residents, and even feels self-conscious about driving due to fear of being judged.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""三环边边"" (on the edge of the Third Ring Road) — suggests a spatial boundary.
  - ""不敢说是土著"" (dare not say I am a native) — implies a distinction between ""natives"" and others.
  - ""走到一环二环都说进城"" (when I go to the First or Second Ring Road, I say I'm going into the city) — suggests a psychological or symbolic boundary between ""city"" and ""suburb.""
  - ""不敢开车 怕遭说"" (dare not drive, afraid of being criticized) — hints at social judgment or status differences.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to the Third Ring Road and the act of going ""into the city"" to the First or Second Ring Road implies a **psychological or socially recognized boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" or ""core"" and ""peripheral"" areas**.
  - The author's self-deprecation (""dare not say I am a native"") and fear of judgment (""afraid of being criticized"") suggest that **there is a social hierarchy or stigma associated with being on the outskirts**, and that **the ""local"" identity is associated with being in the city center**.
  - The author implicitly accepts this social logic — that being in the inner city equals being more ""local"" or ""authentic"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly accepts** the **socially conventional territorial identity logic** — that being in the city center (First/Second Ring) is what counts as ""local"", while being on the outskirts (Third Ring) is not.
  - The author **does not explicitly resist** this logic and instead **reflects internalized social norms**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **implicitly conveys** a **socially conventional territorial identity** logic by recognizing the symbolic and psychological boundary between the city center and the periphery, and by expressing self-consciousness about being on the outskirts.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of the Chengdu accent is not used to define who is or is not a local, but the **positive sentiment** toward it suggests the author sees it as a **cultural marker** of Chengdu and possibly identifies with or appreciates it as part of the local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author's positive attitude toward the Chengdu accent implies a **cultural-linguistic recognition** of Chengdu as a local identity marker.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

They argue that it is, in fact, **outsiders** who are more likely to discriminate against Chengdu locals. The author also implies a **hierarchical or symbolic value** in being a ""local"" by referencing **property ownership** and **economic status**, and they use **spatial language** like ""二环"" (Second Ring Road) and ""春熙路"" (Chunxi Road) to reinforce a **territorial sense of identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都人"" (Chengdu locals)
  - ""外地人"" (outsiders)
  - ""你们屋头有几套房？"" (How many houses do you have at home?)
  - ""二环的"" (living in the Second Ring Road area)
  - ""春熙路"" (Chunxi Road)
  - ""我们去春熙路一般都说进城"" (we usually say we are going into the city when we go to Chunxi Road)
  - ""买得起房"" (able to afford a house)
  - ""给得起彩礼"" (able to give a dowry)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **uses spatial terms** like ""二环"" and ""春熙路"" to **define a local identity** based on **geographical location**, which implies a **territorial boundary** or **mental map** of what is considered ""local"" (RL1).
  - The author **references property ownership** (""几套房"") and **economic status** (""买得起房"", ""给得起彩礼"") to **contrast the economic power of outsiders with locals**, and to **imply that economic status is a marker of identity legitimacy** (RL6).
  - The **questioning behavior of outsiders** (""你们屋头有几套房？"") is used to **criticize their judgmental attitude toward locals**, suggesting that **economic status is being used as a tool to define or evaluate identity** (RL6).
  - The **spatial language** ""进城"" (going into the city) implies that **Chunxi Road is perceived as a central or core area**, and that **people from the outer areas (like the Second Ring Road) go ""in"" to it**, reinforcing a **sense of spatial hierarchy** (RL1).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses spatial and economic indicators** to define who is a ""local"" and who is not.
  - They **endorse the idea that being from a specific area (like the Second Ring Road) is part of one's local identity**, and that **going to Chunxi Road is a symbolic act of ""entering the city""**, which aligns with RL1.
  - The **economic status** and **property ownership** are **used to contrast locals and outsiders**, and to **justify the lack of superiority among locals**, which aligns with RL6.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** is supported by the spatial references to ""二环"" and ""春熙路"", and the idea of ""进城"", which implies a **mental map** and **territorial boundary** for local identity.
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** is supported by the **emphasis on property ownership** and **economic status** as a **means of defining or contrasting identity**, and as a **symbol of social standing**.

RL1, RL3, RL4"," * The author is expressing a sense of identity and belonging as a ""老成都人"" (old Chengdu person), and is defending the idea that Chengdu is an inclusive city. The author is also subtly critiquing the assumption that non-locals are not integrating or contributing, suggesting that the issue may lie with how locals treat outsiders rather than with outsiders themselves.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""老成都人"" (old Chengdu people) implies a generational or historical rootedness.
  * The author defends Chengdu's inclusiveness, which may relate to social identity or territorial belonging.
  * The phrase ""归属感不强不融入当地不是本地人的错"" (lack of sense of belonging and not integrating into the local is not the fault of non-locals) implies a critique of how locals define or exclude outsiders, possibly through social or cultural criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to ""老成都人"" implies a historical and generational identity, suggesting that the author believes in a core group of people who are authentically local.
  * The author is defending Chengdu’s inclusiveness, implying that the city is not defined by strict territorial or cultural boundaries.
  * The author critiques the assumption that non-locals are the ones failing to integrate, suggesting that the fault may lie with how locals define ""local identity"" or treat outsiders.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implies that being a ""老成都人"" is tied to generational or family rootedness, which aligns with RL3.
  * The author also implies that the city's inclusiveness is a defining characteristic, which could relate to a socially conventional territorial identity that is open, aligning with RL1.
  * The author critiques the idea that non-locals are to blame for not integrating, which implies a cultural or social standard is being used to judge locals and outsiders — aligning with RL4.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * RL3 is clearly present through the use of ""老成都人"", which refers to people with generational or family roots in the city.
  * RL1 is also present in the author's implied defense of Chengdu's inclusiveness and the idea that Chengdu has a socially conventional identity.
  * RL4 is relevant because the author is addressing the idea of integration and cultural belonging, suggesting that cultural or social criteria are being used to judge who is a ""local"".

The phrase ""必须焊死在脑门上"" (must be welded to the forehead) is a hyperbolic way of expressing that this identity is deeply ingrained or essential to them.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""锦江区二环攀成钢"" refers to a specific area.
  * The author is expressing a strong emotional and cognitive attachment to this area.
  * The use of hyperbole (""焊死在脑门上"") suggests the area is central to the author's identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The specific area ""锦江区二环攀成钢"" is not just a location but is used as a **symbolic marker of identity**.
  * The author's emotional and cognitive attachment to the area implies that it is **a core part of their self-identification as a local**.
  * The phrase is not about administrative boundaries or language but about **a long-term, emotional, and territorial sense of belonging**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly endorsing the idea that being from ""锦江区二环攀成钢"" is a key part of their identity.
  * The statement implies that this area is **central to the author's sense of being a ""local""**.
  * The emotional and symbolic attachment to the area fits the definition of **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that people (or the author themselves) should/often/can use the logic or standards represented by **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** to define who is/is not ""local"", or to evaluate the quality/scope of a ""local"" area.
  * The area ""锦江区二环攀成钢"" is not just a geographic location but is **imbued with emotional and symbolic meaning**, suggesting a long-accumulated sense of identity and belonging.
  * The phrase ""焊死在脑门上"" emphasizes the **deep and inescapable connection** the author feels to this area, which aligns with the concept of **territorial identity and mental mapping** as part of local identity.

The author implies that Chengdu locals are unfairly targeted and judged by outsiders based on superficial or stereotypical criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions several characteristics outsiders use to judge Chengdu locals: ""成都的面最难吃"" (Chengdu noodles are the worst), ""成都二环内市区破烂"" (the inner ring of Chengdu is run-down), ""口音难听"" (the accent is unpleasant), and ""做人假打"" (people are fake/insincere). These are presented as criteria used by outsiders to judge Chengdu locals negatively.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are used to highlight how outsiders **define or judge** Chengdu locals based on **cultural-linguistic traits (accent, dialect)** and **perceived lifestyle or behavioral traits (fake behavior)**. The author is **not endorsing these criteria** but is **pointing out that they are used by outsiders** to discriminate against locals. The author is **implicitly asserting** that Chengdu locals are unfairly judged and that **real locals are those who are subject to this discrimination**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does **not endorse** the criteria outsiders use (e.g., accent, lifestyle), but the **implicit implication** is that **real locals are those who are targets of this discrimination**, suggesting a **sense of identity formed in opposition to outsiders' judgments**. This aligns with **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** and **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** if the behavior is seen as a cultural trait.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is **implicitly conveying** that **Chengdu locals are defined by being the subject of outsider judgments**, particularly based on **cultural-linguistic traits (e.g., accent, dialect)** and **behavioral stereotypes**. This aligns with **RL4**, as the author is responding to how outsiders judge locals **based on cultural-linguistic traits**. The ""fake behavior"" may also imply a **distinct cultural identity**.

我也三环外甚至都不会说自己是成都人，除非给外地人介绍时再加个成都成都土著一般指的中心城区吧,RL1," - The author is expressing that they **do not identify as a ""true local"" of Chengdu** unless they are in the **central urban area**. The statement implies that **""local"" identity is tied to the central region**, and that being in the outer areas (e.g., the third ring road or beyond) is not sufficient to claim the identity of a ""true Chengdu person.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""三环外"" (outside the third ring road)
  - ""成都人"" (Chengdu person/local)
  - ""成都土著"" (Chengdu native/true local)
  - ""中心城区"" (central urban area)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ""三环外"" and ""中心城区"" is **used to define the boundaries of ""local identity""** — the author suggests that **only those from the central area can be considered true locals**.
  - The phrase ""成都土著"" is used to **label the core group of ""local people""**, and the author implies that **living in the outer areas does not qualify one for this label**.
  - The author's attitude is **affirmative and implicit**, endorsing the idea that **geographic location (central vs. peripheral) is a key criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **using the central area as the standard for defining ""true locals""**, and **rejects the idea that people from the outer areas can be considered true locals**.
  - This is a **territorial-based definition** of local identity, where **the core area is the only valid space for local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's argument aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they **implicitly define the central urban area as the core of local identity**, and **exclude outer areas from this definition**. The author is **reinforcing a social convention** that ""true locals"" are those from the center.

因为我们二环的一般没事不进城，就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩,RL1," * The author is describing a behavior pattern of people from the ""second ring road"" who tend to stay in their own, more remote area rather than go to the city center. This suggests a sense of local identity or preference for one's own area, and potentially a distinction between people from different regions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""因为我们二环的一般没事不进城"" implies a group of people associated with a specific geographical area (the second ring road).
  * The phrase ""就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩"" further reinforces a local attachment to a remote or less central area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the geographical area (""二环"") to define a group of people who prefer to stay within their own area. This reflects a **territorial identity**.
  * The mention of ""偏僻的地方"" (remote place) could imply a **self-identification with a specific area**, potentially distinguishing it from more central or developed areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is implicitly endorsing a **territorial identity** by associating behavior (not going to the city center) with a geographical location (""二环"").

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is expressing a **territorial identity** by associating a group of people with a specific geographical area and describing their behavior as staying in their own ""remote"" area. This supports the **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** category.

This term is passed down from older generations and is often used in a joking manner without any malicious intent. The author emphasizes that it is not meant to be discriminatory and is more of a generational habit.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The use of ""三环外"" (beyond the third ring road) implies a geographical boundary.
  - The term ""弯脚杆"" is used to distinguish people from different areas.
  - The author mentions that this term is linked to a different **accent**.
  - The author implies that this is a **cultural and generational habit**, passed down from older generations.
  - The term is used **in a joking manner**, not as a serious form of discrimination.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The geographical boundary (""三环外"") is used to define who is considered ""local"" and who is not.
  - The accent is used as a **marker of cultural difference**, and is tied to the identity of being ""local"" or ""non-local"".
  - The term ""弯脚杆"" is used **in a non-discriminatory way**, but still functions as a **linguistic and cultural label** that distinguishes between locals and outsiders.
  - The author suggests that this is a **cultural habit**, passed down through generations, which is part of the **local identity system**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author accepts the **geographical boundary** as part of the local identity framework.
  - The **accent** is used to distinguish between locals and non-locals.
  - The **cultural habit of using a specific term** is accepted as part of the local identity, even if it is not discriminatory.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author implicitly accepts the third ring road as a boundary for defining local identity and acknowledges that people from beyond it are considered different in terms of identity.
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author notes that the accent is a distinguishing feature, and the term ""弯脚杆"" is used to label people from different areas, reflecting a cultural habit of distinguishing locals from non-locals.

The author also mentions a relative criticizing their boyfriend as ""**农转非**"" (a person who has changed from a rural to urban household registration), suggesting that this status is still not seen as fully local or legitimate.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土著"" (native/local people)
  * ""看不起外地的"" (look down on outsiders)
  * ""三环外的都不行"" (people from beyond the Third Ring Road are not acceptable)
  * ""农转非"" (rural-to-urban hukou status)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is conveying the **criteria that locals use to judge who is or is not a ""local""**, including:
    * **Geographic boundaries (Third Ring Road)** as a dividing line.
    * **Administrative household registration status (""农转非"")** as a marker of legitimacy.
    * **Social attitudes (looking down on outsiders)** as a reflection of the **socially conventional territorial identity**.
  * The author **implicitly conveys** these as the **standards that define ""local identity""** within the local community.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly opposing the criteria but is **describing them as the prevailing standards** that locals apply.
  * These criteria are **used to define who is a ""local"" and who is not**, and they serve as **standards for social exclusion or inclusion**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author describes how people define local identity based on **geographic boundaries** (e.g., ""三环外的都不行"") and **social attitudes** (e.g., ""看不起外地的"").
  * **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – The author references ""**农转非**"" as a **household registration status** that is still not fully accepted as ""local"", indicating that **legal or administrative status** plays a role in defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""大邑不算"" (Dàyì doesn't count) and ""一二三环内"" (first, second, third ring) are key elements.
  * These refer to **geographical areas** and **urban rings**, suggesting a **territorial definition** of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The statement explicitly defines the boundary of what is considered the ""local area"" by excluding Dàyì and including only the inner city rings.
  * The author's attitude is **exclusive**, emphasizing that only those within the first three rings are considered ""natives"" or ""true locals.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses **geographical proximity to the city center** as a defining criterion for who is a ""local.""
  * This is **explicitly endorsed** and **functionally used to exclude outsiders and include ""true locals.""**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This matches **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is defining the ""local"" identity based on **long-accumulated social habits and a conventional understanding of city rings**, where inner rings are seen as the core area and Dàyì is excluded from the ""local"" identity system.

The key point is that **outsiders in Chengdu now discriminate against locals**, a phenomenon that is **new or more noticeable** compared to the past, when locals had a strong local accent and possibly more distinct identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""大邑口音"" (Dayi accent): Suggests **local linguistic identity**.
  - ""成都土著"" (Chengdu locals): Indicates **local identity**.
  - ""外地人特别歧视成都土著"" (outsiders discriminate against Chengdu locals): Implies **social segregation** and **identity-based conflict**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""大邑口音"" is mentioned as part of the **historical identity** of locals, suggesting that **language and accent** are tied to local identity.
  - The phrase ""成都土著"" implies a **sense of rootedness** and **long-standing local identity**.
  - The **discrimination** mentioned is not just a social observation, but reflects a **shift in power dynamics**, where **outsiders are now the ones defining or asserting superiority**, possibly based on their economic or social presence in the city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implies that the local accent (Dayi) and the label ""土著""** are **traditional markers of local identity**.
  - The **discrimination** mentioned reflects a **change in how local identity is being challenged or devalued**, which is a **social recognition** issue.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""口音"" (accent) directly relates to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  * ""穿着品味"" (clothing taste) could potentially relate to cultural or social habits, but it is **not clearly tied to the definition of ""local identity""** and is **too vague** to confidently categorize under any RL.
  * ""思想观念"" (thoughts/ideology) is too broad and **not clearly used to define ""local identity""**, so it is **not annotated**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of ""口音"" implies that the speaker may use **language or accent** as a marker to distinguish ""local"" people from outsiders.
  * There is **no explicit or implicit endorsement** of clothing taste or ideology as criteria for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

This implies a **critical reflection on the criteria used to define ""local"" identity** and the potential for **discrimination based on cultural markers**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土著"" (indigenous/locals)
  - ""外地人"" (outsiders)
  - ""思想意识"" (thoughts/ideology)
  - ""口音"" (accent)
  - ""穿着品味"" (clothing style)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**

认识的成都本地朋友中，没有这种人。网上一刷，这成都的鄙视链比北京都严重。比京二环的好像要牛气多了,"**
RL1"," * The author is expressing surprise and disapproval at the perceived intensity of the local ""hierarchy of disdain"" (鄙视链) in Chengdu, suggesting that it is more pronounced than in Beijing. The author is contrasting their own experience of Chengdu locals (whom they describe as not exhibiting this behavior) with what they see online, implying a critique of how some Chengdu locals define or perceive who is ""truly local"" or superior within the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""成都本地朋友"" (Chengdu locals), indicating a concept of ""local identity"".
  * The phrase ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain) suggests a social or cultural hierarchy that is used to distinguish or rank different types of ""local"" people.
  * The author contrasts their personal experience with what is observed online, implying a difference in how ""local identity"" is perceived or expressed.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the concept of a ""hierarchy of disdain"" to critique how some Chengdu locals define or judge who is more ""authentic"" or superior within the local identity framework.
  * The contrast between the author's experience and online portrayals suggests that the author is implicitly defining ""true locals"" as those who do not engage in such hierarchical behavior, thus implying a socially conventional standard of local identity based on behavior and social norms.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly defines ""local identity"" based on behavior that aligns with a socially accepted standard of Chengdu locals who do not engage in hierarchical disdain.
  * The author critiques those who do engage in such behavior as not being representative of ""true locals"", thus implicitly endorsing a socially conventional standard of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is critiquing a behavior that is implicitly linked to a socially conventional understanding of Chengdu local identity.
  * The author’s disapproval of the ""hierarchy of disdain"" implies that ""true locals"" are those who do not engage in such behavior, which aligns with the socially conventional territorial identity as defined by shared values and social norms.

RL3"," - The author is a native of the 2nd ring road area of Chengdu. They emphasize that they have **no sense of superiority** despite being a local, and that they **do not form exclusive social circles**. They also mention that their friends are mostly **not locals**, but this does **not affect their perception** of being a local. The core intent is to **reject the idea that being a local implies exclusivity or superiority**, and to **implicitly define local identity through birthplace or upbringing** (being a ""native"") rather than social or cultural boundaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都二环内土著"" (native of the 2nd ring road in Chengdu) – implies **RL3**.
  - ""没优越感"" (no sense of superiority) – **not directly an RL**, but suggests a **rejection of social or cultural exclusion**.
  - ""社交圈子"" (social circle) – **not directly an RL**, but could relate to **RL1** if it implies social segregation.
  - ""有几个朋友，大多不是本地人"" (has a few friends, most are not locals) – implies **no social boundary or cultural exclusion** based on being a local.
  - ""也没觉得啥"" (doesn't feel anything about it) – suggests **no emotional or cognitive boundary** between locals and non-locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""成都二环内土著"" is central to the author's identity and is used to **define themselves as a local**, based on **birthplace and upbringing**.
  - The rest of the text functions to **reject the idea that being a local equates to exclusivity or superiority**, and to **show that being a local does not necessarily mean forming an exclusive social or cultural group**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly identifies themselves as a ""native"" of a specific area**, which is a **clear RL3** criterion.
  - The author **does not endorse any social segregation, cultural exclusion, or superiority**, so **RL1, RL4, and RL6 are not endorsed**.
  - The author **does not mention administrative boundaries, language, or economic status**, so **RL2, RL5, and RL7 are not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author identifies as a ""native"" of a specific area (2nd ring road in Chengdu), which is a **clear RL3** criterion.
  - The rest of the text is **not about defining local identity**, but rather about **rejecting the idea of exclusivity or superiority associated with being a local**.

**Output:**

They express a sense of detachment or skepticism toward this newly defined identity label, suggesting that it was not part of their childhood experience and that its origin is unclear.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""成都土著"" (""Chengdu native"") implies a concept of ""local identity"" that is being referenced.
  * The author is not clearly defining what constitutes a ""Chengdu native"" but is questioning the origin and legitimacy of the concept.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author does not explicitly endorse any specific criteria for defining ""Chengdu native""; instead, they are reflecting on the **social construction** of the term and expressing doubt about who decided it and how it became a standard.
  * The author is not using the concept to define who is or is not a local but is **critiquing** the emergence of such a label.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not endorsing** any specific criteria for defining ""local identity""; rather, they are questioning the **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) as a constructed label.
  * The author **does not** appear to be using administrative, cultural, or historical criteria to define ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **does not explicitly endorse** any RL criteria for defining ""local identity.""
  * However, the **questioning of the origin and legitimacy** of the term ""成都土著"" implies a **rejection or skepticism of the socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), as it is being treated as a constructed and possibly arbitrary label.

Despite this, the author does not feel that being a ""local"" inherently brings a sense of superiority. Instead, they express a nostalgic attachment to the old neighborhoods and community life of their childhood.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土著"" (local/indigenous person) – implies a historical rootedness.
  * ""从长顺街出来的"" – suggests a specific geographic origin.
  * ""羡慕当年周边的城乡结合部，有分红，有拆迁，有土地"" – implies that economic benefits from land or property are seen as markers of a better ""local"" status.
  * ""羡慕从农村来的，过年可以回乡下放火炮，杀猪，天然无污染环境"" – suggests that rural roots and a connection to traditional lifestyles are seen as desirable.
  * ""军区后勤的家属"" – implies that certain occupational backgrounds are associated with social privileges.
  * ""怀念以前长顺上街，中街以及长发街附近的老邻居些"" – suggests an emotional and social connection to the local community.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses their own identity as a ""local"" to contrast with others who have more material or social advantages. They do **not** express a sense of superiority, but they **acknowledge** that other groups (e.g., rural residents, military families) have different forms of local identity or benefits.
  * The mention of land, property, and social privileges (e.g., dividends, military benefits) are **not rejected**, but rather **acknowledged as criteria** that others use to define their local status.
  * The author **implicitly defines** their own local identity through **historical rootedness**, **geographic origin**, and **emotional attachment to old neighborhoods**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **endorses** the idea that being a ""local"" is tied to **historical roots and emotional attachment to a specific place**.
  * They **acknowledge** (but do not endorse) that **economic benefits from land/property and social privileges from occupation** are also used to define local identity.
  * They **do not endorse** the idea that being a ""local"" equates to superiority.

The statement seems to reflect a sense of detachment or indifference toward the city center, but it does not clearly express a definition or evaluation of ""local identity"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of ""三环外"" (beyond the third ring road) and ""城乡结合部"" (urban-rural fringe) may hint at a geographical or administrative boundary.
  * The phrase ""周边啥都有"" (everything is available around here) may relate to functional livability.
  * The statement ""反正不进城里玩"" (I don’t go into the city to play anyway) may reflect a perception of urban versus suburban identity, but it is not clearly used as a criterion for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The geographical location is mentioned, but it is not used as a standard for judging whether someone is a ""local"" or for defining the boundaries of a local area.
  * The description of ""周边啥都有"" might relate to RL5 (Functional Livability), but it is not framed as a standard for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating the value of a local area.
  * The author's attitude toward the city is indifferent, but there is no indication that this is used as a basis for defining who is or is not a ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The text does not clearly use any of the RL criteria to define ""local identity"" or evaluate local areas. The author is merely describing their own living situation and preferences, not presenting a standard for judging local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * No RL category is clearly activated or endorsed by the author in the context of defining ""local identity"".

The focus is on how certain older locals, especially those living in outdated, small, and run-down housing in the inner city, tend to look down on or mock people from areas beyond the Third Ring Road. The author implies that this behavior is rooted in a sense of local identity that excludes outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老土著"" (old locals): implies a long-standing, possibly traditional local identity.
  - ""住在那种老破小"" (living in old, run-down, small housing): suggests a physical and possibly socio-economic rootedness in the area.
  - ""三环外"" (beyond the Third Ring Road): implies a territorial or geographical boundary used to distinguish locals from outsiders.
  - ""弯脚杆"" (mocking or derogatory term): indicates a form of social exclusion or discrimination based on local identity.
  - ""中年和老年人"" (middle-aged and elderly people): implies that this behavior is more common among older generations, possibly with stronger rootedness in the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using **geographical boundaries (Third Ring Road)** and **housing conditions (old, run-down housing)** to describe the social group that exhibits exclusionary behavior.
  - The **age and housing characteristics** of these locals suggest a deep-rooted, generational identity.
  - The **mocking behavior (""弯脚杆"")** is used to demonstrate how this local identity is used to exclude or look down on outsiders.
  - The author's tone is somewhat critical of this behavior, but the description still reflects how this local identity is constructed and used in social interactions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is not opposing the idea of local identity per se, but is describing how it is **used by some locals to exclude outsiders**.
  - The **geographical boundary (Third Ring Road)** is used to define who is ""local"" and who is not.
  - The **housing condition (""老破小"")** and **residence in the area** are part of the identity that gives these locals a sense of superiority.
  - The **generational aspect (middle-aged and elderly)** suggests that this identity is long-standing and historically rooted.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author implicitly uses the boundary of the Third Ring Road as a conventional marker to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas. The mocking behavior of locals toward those outside this boundary reflects a socially conventional territorial identity.
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The mention of middle-aged and elderly locals living in old, run-down housing suggests a long-term, intergenerational presence in the area, which contributes to their sense of being ""true locals.""
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** – The locals' behavior is tied to their **deep social roots and possibly economic status**, as they live in a specific part of the city and use this to assert superiority over outsiders.

好像！！？你说的有道理！！！不过成都土著没有拆迁户过的轻松就不明白这优越感哪里来的hhh,N/A," - The author is reacting to a previous statement, agreeing that the point made is valid. However, the author is also questioning the source of a certain sense of superiority (""优越感"") held by native Chengdu residents (""成都土著"") — especially in contrast to those who have benefited from being relocated due to urban development (""拆迁户""). The author seems to challenge the idea that being a ""native"" automatically grants a better or more legitimate local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu residents) – implies a concept of local identity based on birth or long-standing residence.
  - ""拆迁户"" (relocation due to urban development) – may imply a different type of local identity, perhaps based on more recent settlement or economic benefits.
  - ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) – suggests the author is questioning the legitimacy of certain criteria used to define ""local"" identity.
  - The author is not describing the benefits or quality of the Chengdu area itself, but rather questioning the basis for the perceived superiority of ""natives.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""成都土著"" is used to represent a traditional or conventional form of local identity, which the author is implicitly questioning.
  - The contrast with ""拆迁户"" highlights the author's view that local identity is not necessarily tied to being born or raised in the area, but can also be influenced by other factors like economic benefits.
  - The author is **not endorsing** the idea that being a ""native"" is a valid or superior basis for local identity, but is instead **challenging** it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse** any RL criteria for defining ""local identity"" — rather, the author is **questioning the legitimacy** of the traditional ""natives"" (""土著"") as a basis for superiority.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The phrase ""成都土著"" could be associated with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** and **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it implies a traditional or long-standing local identity. However, the author is **not endorsing** this as a valid or superior form of identity — instead, they are **challenging** it.
  - The contrast with ""拆迁户"" implies a different form of local identity based on more recent settlement or economic factors, but this is **not clearly framed** as a defining standard the author endorses.
  - Since the author is **questioning** the legitimacy of ""成都土著"" as a basis for identity and **not clearly endorsing** any RL-based criteria, no RL categories are directly supported by the author's core argument.

  * ""口音难听"" (""difficult to listen to accent"") relates to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  * The author is using negative stereotypes to distinguish ""Chengdu people"" from others, implying that these traits define them as outsiders or non-""authentic"" people.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The ""difficult to listen to accent"" is used to mock and differentiate Chengdu people, implying that linguistic and cultural traits are used to judge whether someone is ""local"" or not.
  * The author's attitude is clearly negative, and the RL4 element functions as a **marker of cultural and linguistic difference**, used to **exclude** or **label** Chengdu people as non-""local"" or undesirable.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The only RL element clearly used by the author to define or judge Chengdu people is the **linguistic/cultural trait** (RL4), as the author uses it to mock and label Chengdu people as undesirable or non-""local"" in a social sense.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using the **local accent** (""口音难听"") as a criterion to judge Chengdu people as non-""local"" or undesirable. This aligns with RL4, where **language and cultural habits** are used to distinguish between ""us"" and ""them"", or to define who belongs to the ""local"" group.

The core intent is to challenge the idea that only outsiders look down on the local accent, and to examine how the Chengdu accent is perceived within the local identity framework.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is central.
  * The author is questioning the existence of ""discrimination"" or ""bias"" against the local accent.
  * The phrase ""外地人"" (outsiders) is used, which implies a contrast between ""local"" and ""non-local"" identities.
  * The mention of accent is a potential link to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The Chengdu accent is being discussed in the context of **how it is perceived by others**, and the author is questioning whether **only outsiders** look down on it.
  * The author is **implicitly suggesting** that **local people might also look down on the Chengdu accent**, possibly challenging the idea of a unified ""local"" identity that includes cultural linguistic pride.
  * This implies that **the Chengdu accent is a marker of local identity**, and how it is treated can reflect **who is considered ""local"" or ""not local""** in terms of cultural acceptance.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **using the Chengdu accent as a cultural marker** for local identity.
  * The question implies that **how the accent is treated** is a **standard for judging who is or is not a ""local""** in terms of acceptance or bias.

  * The author uses the expression ""挺好听的呀"" (sounds nice) to express **positive recognition of this feature**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of the Chengdu accent is **not just a casual observation**, but a **positive evaluation** that aligns with a **local cultural identity**.

They note that there is no inherent superiority among locals, except for some self-entitled locals (e.g., certain relocated residents), and that intermarriage between locals and non-locals is common. The author seems to be countering the idea that being ""local"" implies social superiority or exclusive social circles.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mentions of ""本地人"" (local people), ""外地人"" (non-locals), and the contrast between them.
  * The author notes that most of their friends and colleagues are non-locals, and that many marriages are between locals.
  * The author contrasts the behavior of some ""拆迁户老嬢嬢"" (relocated residents, older women), who display a sense of superiority.
  * The author implies that the social composition of the local community includes a significant number of non-locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the presence of non-locals in their life to argue that being ""local"" does not equate to social superiority.
  * The author implicitly critiques the idea of local identity being used to create social hierarchies, especially through the example of some relocated residents.
  * The author also shows that local identity is not the only path to forming social connections or marriage, as many people have intermarried with non-locals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

They also mention how migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan perceived them as locals and expressed envy. However, the author now feels that the sense of superiority or distinctiveness as a local has diminished, especially as migrants have also settled in Chengdu and bought homes there.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ""本地人"" (local people) and how they were perceived by migrant workers.
  - Reference to ""小时候有"" (there was a time when it existed) implying a historical or generational rootedness.
  - Mention of not paying rent and living at home, suggesting a family-based or rooted lifestyle.
  - The author’s child asking about a ""老家"" (hometown), which relates to identity and belonging.
  - The author’s current perception that the distinction between locals and migrants is fading as migrants also settle in Chengdu.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the idea of **being born and raised in Chengdu** to contrast their lifestyle with that of migrant workers, implying a **historical rootedness** and **family-based identity** as a local.
  - The perception of **migrant workers envying the author as a local** supports the idea that **being a local is associated with a certain lifestyle or status**.
  - The child’s confusion about having a ""老家"" and the author’s response that ""老家 is Chengdu"" suggests that **the author sees Chengdu as their natural or inherited home**, reinforcing a **family-based rootedness**.
  - The author’s conclusion that there is no longer a strong sense of local superiority reflects a **changing perception of what it means to be a local**, possibly due to **increased settlement of migrants**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that **being born and raised in the city** (RL3) is a key factor in identifying as a local.
  - The author also implies that **migrant workers perceive locals as having a better lifestyle**, which is tied to **family-based rootedness** (RL3).
  - The author contrasts **their own upbringing with that of migrant workers**, implying that **being a local is tied to a lifestyle rooted in the city**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The core intent is to highlight how outsiders judge the author based on linguistic and cultural characteristics, which are seen as markers of being a local.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of “口音” (accent), “牙尖弯酸” (a colloquial expression implying a sharp or grating tone), and “电炒饭” (a local culinary term) all point to linguistic and cultural markers that outsiders use to identify the author as a local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These linguistic features are being used by outsiders to judge the author as a local, which the author experiences as discrimination. The author is implying that **speaking with a local accent and using local expressions are seen as definitive markers of local identity**, and this is used to distinguish insiders from outsiders.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * While the author is not directly stating what defines a local, the fact that they are being judged by outsiders based on these features **implies that the author recognizes these features as defining characteristics of local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of accent (""口音"") and the judgment from others (""别个说我的口音好难听"") may relate to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it involves the perception of whether one belongs to the local group based on speech characteristics.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is not defining what ""local people"" are, but is **reacting to the implicit assumption that a ""local accent"" is superior or more acceptable**. This implies that **the author is resisting a cultural-linguistic standard used to judge local identity**. However, the author is not themselves endorsing or using the accent as a standard for defining ""local identity""—they are rejecting the judgment from others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not themselves using the accent as a criterion** for defining local identity. They are **resisting a criterion** that others may be using, but not endorsing or constructing one themselves. Therefore, **no RL criterion is endorsed or used by the author** to define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * While **RL4** is mentioned, it is **not endorsed** by the author. The author is **rejecting** the idea that accent should be used to judge local identity, rather than defining it themselves. Since the task requires only criteria **explicitly or implicitly conveyed by the author** for defining local identity, and **not those resisted**, this does **not qualify** for annotation.

RL1, RL3, RL4, RL6"," - The author is expressing what they believe gives ""locals"" (referred to as ""土著"") a sense of superiority or identity. This superiority is not rooted in material wealth (e.g., owning multiple properties) but in **deep cultural and familial ties to the city of Chengdu**, shared traditions, language, and long-term social connections.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions:
    - Generations of family living in the same place.
    - Cultural practices such as family gatherings and speaking the local dialect (Chengduhua).
    - Shared cultural and linguistic identity.
    - Deep familiarity with the city and its changes.

  - The author **strongly endorses** these elements as **authentic markers of local identity**, especially in contrast to materialistic or superficial indicators.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses:
    - Generational family history in the local area.
    - Cultural and linguistic recognition (speaking Chengduhua, shared traditions).
    - Deep social and emotional roots in the city.
    - Long-term community ties and friendships.
    - Emotional and historical connection to the city.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author emphasizes that locals are those whose families have lived in Chengdu for generations.
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author highlights the importance of speaking Chengduhua and sharing cultural practices as markers of local identity.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author conveys a strong emotional and historical connection to the city, suggesting that locals have a shared mental map and cultural identity that defines their belonging.
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** – The author implicitly contrasts the materialistic values of outsiders with the deep, non-material social roots that define locals.

The author is using this identity as a basis to establish connection or mutual understanding. The intent is to signal that they are a ""local"" and to inquire if the other person is also from the area, possibly to gauge if they share similar local identity traits.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""成华区土著三代成都人"" (third-generation Chengdu native from Chenghua District) — implies long-term settlement and family history.
  * ""口音可查"" (accent can be checked) — refers to linguistic identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses ""third-generation Chengdu native"" to establish their rootedness in the local area, signaling authenticity of their local identity.
  * The mention of ""accent can be checked"" implies that the author views accent as a key marker for distinguishing locals from outsiders.
  * Both elements are used to define the author's own local identity and possibly to assess the local status of the person they are addressing.

The text implies that people from outside the area cannot be considered ""local"" if they are not understood due to their accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The key phrase is: “你说的话（口音）他们听不懂” (they can't understand what you say due to your accent).
  - The phrase “哪个县份上的” (which county) suggests the author is considering regional or local identity in terms of geographic origin.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **accent** is used as a **defining criterion** to distinguish between locals and non-locals.
  - The **question about which county** implies the author assumes a **regional-based identity system** where people from different counties are not fully ""local"" to others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses accent as a criterion** to determine whether someone is ""local"" (understood by others).
  - The **regional (county-level) origin** is also **implied as a standard** for determining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** is clearly present as the author uses **accent** as a marker for local identity.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** is also present, as the author implies **county-level distinctions** in local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""四川话"" (Sichuan dialect), ""口音"" (accent), ""难听"" (unattractive), ""外地人"" (outsiders), ""联姻"" (intermarriage).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the Sichuan accent as a **marker of local identity**, implying that it is a defining feature of being a local. The mention of outsiders not wanting their children to speak with this accent suggests the author perceives the accent as a **symbol of local culture** that outsiders might resist.
  * The mention of ""联姻"" suggests the author believes **social ties or intermarriage** are used to **reinforce or preserve local identity**, which aligns with a deeper sense of belonging and social rootedness.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

They emphasize their own values—hard work, humility, and success in both career and property ownership—while defending the idea that Chengdu locals do not look down on outsiders. The author also subtly conveys a sense of self-worth and local identity rooted in personal achievement and social integration.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses:
    - Chengdu people in general and the stereotype of being boastful.
    - Young Chengdu people being more modest.
    - The presence of educated and high-achieving Chengdu people.
    - The author's own spouse and colleagues being non-local.
    - The author's personal success in career and property ownership.
    - The author's attitude of humility and not showing off.
    - The author's pride in being ""laborious, wise, kind, and hardworking.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses personal experience and self-identification to redefine what it means to be a ""local"" in Chengdu. They reject the stereotype of boastfulness and instead highlight personal qualities such as education, career success, and property ownership. These elements serve to construct a positive and self-reflective image of a ""local"" person who is not defined by regional exclusivity or traditional stereotypes.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not** use administrative, historical, or linguistic criteria to define local identity.
  - They **do** emphasize personal qualities and achievements (e.g., education, property, career success, and humility).
  - These elements are used to affirm the author's own identity as a local and to contrast it with negative stereotypes.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author emphasizes personal growth, educational background, and career achievements, which aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as they reflect the idea of personal development and integration into the local context.
  - The author's ownership of property in a specific area (南门) and the emphasis on it being a symbol of success and identity aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.
  - The author's attitude of humility and not showing off, despite success, is part of how they define their own ""local"" identity, subtly implying that true ""local"" identity is marked by such values. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a socially accepted image of what a mature, humble, and successful local should be.

The author mocks such people for their exclusiveness and their tendency to become submissive when encountering other ""local"" groups that they consider superior. The central focus is on how the author perceives and critiques the criteria used to define who is a ""true local"" in a city like Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text includes several elements that relate to territorial definitions, generational roots, and cultural self-identification. These include references to ""五城区"" (five urban districts), ""南门"" (south gate), ""天府新区"" (Tianfu New Area), and ""华阳、龙泉"" (Huayang, Longquan), as well as claims about being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **critiquing** the criteria used by some Chengdu residents to define ""true locals"", particularly based on geographical origin and generational roots. The author implicitly accepts these criteria as the **basis for the exclusiveness and identity boundaries** these people use, but **explicitly rejects** the **attitude and behavior** of those who use these criteria to look down on others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does **not** endorse the criteria themselves, but they are **explicitly referenced and used** as the **basis for identity claims** by the group being criticized. Therefore, the criteria are **relevant to the definition of ""local identity""** and must be annotated.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author critiques the belief that being born and raised in the ""five urban districts"" (五城区) defines one as a ""true Chengdu person"". This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, since the author refers to ""土生土长"" (born and raised here).
  * The author also critiques the belief that only the five urban districts are considered the ""real Chengdu"", and not places like HuaYang or LongQuan.

The tone is mocking or self-deprecating, possibly reflecting a common stereotype or social observation. The author is not explicitly defining ""local identity"" but is referencing the idea that locals may feel superior to outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""成都土著"" (Chengdu locals) implies a group identity defined by birthplace or long-term settlement.
  * The mention of ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) suggests a social or cultural hierarchy.
  * The phrase is used humorously, which may indicate that the author is referencing a commonly accepted perception rather than making a strong argument.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""成都土著"" refers to a group defined by rootedness or historical presence in Chengdu.
  * The reference to a ""sense of superiority"" may imply that the author believes this group sees themselves as more authentic or legitimate.
  * The humor may suggest that this is a common stereotype or shared understanding.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly defining ""local identity"" but is referencing the idea that ""Chengdu locals"" have a certain identity or status.
  * The reference to ""土著"" (natives) implies a rootedness or historical presence in the area, which is a key aspect of RL3.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""成都土著"" aligns with RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History, as it implies a sense of long-term settlement or birthplace.
  * The reference to ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) may imply a hierarchy in local identity, which is not directly covered by RL6 unless it is explicitly tied to economic status or social connections. In this case, it is not.

  - Implicitly, the author contrasts the original local character of older neighborhoods with the new, less inclusive urban areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the livability and inclusiveness of older neighborhoods as a standard to evaluate the quality of a ""local"" area.
  - The author implicitly sees the presence of low-income populations as a sign of a more authentic or legitimate local community.
  - These features are used to support the author's argument about the negative effects of urban renewal on the local character and identity of Chengdu.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

我也一直以为只要是哈尔滨辖区内不管市里还是县里的都可以算是哈尔滨市的人 直到我在小红书看到有人说县里的都是农村的 不属于哈尔滨人 他们老哈尔滨人只有道里的,"** RL1, RL2"," * The author is expressing surprise and correction of a previously held belief about what constitutes being a ""Harbin person."" They are reacting to a claim that only people from a specific district (Dao Li) are considered ""true"" locals, and others (from the county) are not. The author is questioning or challenging the idea of exclusive local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author references ""Harbin jurisdiction,"" ""city center,"" ""county,"" and the concept of ""old Harbin people"" (老哈尔滨人).
  * There is a mention of a distinction between ""city"" and ""county"" as well as a reference to Dao Li as the ""real"" Harbin locals.
  * These references may relate to **RL1** (territorial identity), **RL2** (administrative legitimacy), and **RL3** (family/generational rootedness).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author’s belief that all people within Harbin’s administrative boundaries are ""Harbin people"" aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.
  * The claim that only Dao Li people are ""true"" locals implies **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, where certain areas are culturally or historically seen as the ""real"" local core.
  * The author is responding to an external claim, but the core of their own belief is about administrative boundaries and inclusiveness of identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses **RL2** as the basis for defining who is a ""Harbin person.""
  * The author also implicitly acknowledges **RL1**, as they are reacting to a socially conventional territorial identity claim.
  * There is no mention of family history, language, economic status, or occupation, so other RLs are not relevant.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that being within the administrative jurisdiction of Harbin is sufficient to be considered a Harbin person (**RL2**).
  * They are also aware of and reacting to the socially conventional territorial identity logic that only certain areas (like Dao Li) are considered the ""real"" Harbin (**RL1**).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author refers to ""哈市"" (Harbin city), ""哈市辖区"" (Harbin city district), and ""主城区"" (main urban area).
  * The author comments on how people from surrounding counties identify themselves as ""local"" and criticizes those who claim to be from the ""main urban area"" as ""搞笑的"" (funny/ridiculous).
  * There is an implicit hierarchy or boundary in how people define themselves as ""local"" based on the area they come from.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the distinction between ""district"" and ""county"" to argue that not all people who claim to be from ""Harbin"" or the ""main urban area"" are truly ""local"" in the deeper sense.
  * The author's criticism implies that **being from the main urban area** carries a stronger claim to ""local identity,"" and that people from surrounding counties who claim this identity are overreaching.
  * The author is **implicitly endorsing** a **mental map or territorial identity** that distinguishes between different parts of the city and assigns different levels of legitimacy to the ""local"" identity based on where one is from.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not merely describing** a fact or a preference, but is **making a value judgment** about who can legitimately claim to be a ""local"" of the main urban area.
  * The author **implicitly accepts** a **hierarchical territorial identity** that differentiates between the main urban area and surrounding counties.
  * The author **rejects** the legitimacy of people from surrounding counties claiming to be from the main urban area, suggesting a **strong territorial boundary** in the definition of ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's core argument is based on **territorial identity**, particularly the **mental map and boundary between the main urban area and surrounding counties**.
  * This is a classic case of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, where the author **implicitly accepts** a **socially recognized boundary** and uses it to evaluate who can be considered a ""true local.""

  - The key elements are:
    - ""肯定不算北京人啊"" (definitely not a Beijing person)
    - ""说话口音也不像"" (accent is not like that of a Beijing person)
    - ""文化背景也不同"" (cultural background is also different)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **using differences in accent and cultural background** as **criteria to exclude someone from being considered a ""Beijing person""**.
  - These elements are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as **valid indicators of non-local identity**.
  - The author is not merely describing these features, but **using them to define who is or is not a local**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The **accent** and **cultural background** are used to **determine whether someone is a ""Beijing person""**.
  - These are **explicitly used by the author to judge local identity**, so they are relevant and endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The **accent** and **cultural background** align with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
    - The author uses **""accent"" (口音)** and **""cultural background"" (文化背景)** to **determine whether someone is part of the ""local people"" group**.

  - The author **affirms** a **socially conventional territorial identity** by emphasizing the legitimacy of identifying as a ""双城人"".
  - The author **affirms** a **broadened and inclusive definition** of local identity based on **contribution and shared life experience**, which aligns with a **socially conventional** and **inclusive** understanding of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's emphasis on identifying as ""双城人"" and rejecting the idea that being from a district of Harbin elevates one's status aligns with **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**. The author is asserting that regional identity and pride are rooted in specific hometowns, not in administrative hierarchy.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author references the historical and current administrative divisions of Harbin.
  * The author mentions specific districts and counties (e.g., the original seven districts, now expanded).
  * The author contrasts old and new definitions of ""local Harbin people.""
  * The author explicitly rejects the need to distinguish between ""true"" and ""non-true"" locals based on where they come from within the city.
  * The author uses the phrase “啥哈尔滨人……唉，都是中国人，行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人” which implies a shift toward administrative legitimacy as the standard.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **historical and current administrative divisions** to show how the concept of ""local Harbin people"" has changed over time.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “不属于哈尔滨” (not part of Harbin), which implies a discussion about territorial or administrative boundaries.
  * The author is countering the idea that something or someone is ""not local"" by emphasizing their inclusion in Harbin.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""不属于哈尔滨"" suggests a territorial or administrative boundary logic used to define who or what is considered ""local.""
  * The author's response affirms that these things **do** belong to Harbin, indicating a **defended administrative or territorial logic** for defining ""local identity.""

The author is implying that **economic disparity is not significant enough** in Harbin to justify such divisions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""分起来是不是正不正宗的哈尔滨人"" (distinguishing between authentic and non-authentic Harbin locals) → possibly relates to **RL1** (territorial identity), **RL6** (economic status symbolism), or **RL2** (administrative legitimacy), but the author is **rejecting** this distinction.
  - ""房价也没比我周边县城贵多少"" (housing prices are not much higher than surrounding counties) → possibly related to **RL5** (functional livability & environmental quality cognition), but the author is **arguing against** using this as a basis for defining local identity.
  - ""什么时候贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧"" (let’s divide when wealth gaps are as big as in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) → clearly **rejecting** the idea of using economic criteria to define local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **not endorsing** any of the RL elements mentioned (i.e., economic status, housing prices, or regional distinctions), but is **arguing against** using them to define local identity.
  - The author is **implying that such distinctions are unnecessary** and **not reflective of real local identity differences** in Harbin.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **historical and administrative centrality** of the museum roundabout area as a key criterion for defining the ""true"" city center — this is **RL1**, as it reflects a socially conventional territorial identity based on historical development and symbolic meaning.
  * The author contrasts the **Lao Dao Wai** as the ""local people's area"" — this implies a **different kind of local identity**, possibly based on **historical settlement and cultural roots**, which aligns with **RL3**.
  * The author does not use administrative boundaries, language, economic status, or occupational symbolism to define ""local identity"", and does not mention livability in a way that would clearly define a ""good local area"", so RL2, RL4, RL5, and RL6 can be ruled out.

  - The author uses **哈西** and **群力** as examples of how urban development shifts and how the value of an area can change over time.
  - The author emphasizes **transportation convenience and accessibility** as key factors in determining the functional livability of an area, and by extension, the desirability or ""local value"" of where to live.
  - The author contrasts the **central city** with **peripheral areas**, implying that centrality used to be a significant advantage in terms of convenience and quality of life, but that this advantage has diminished with better transportation and infrastructure.
  - The author **explicitly links the functional quality of an area to its ""local value""**, especially in terms of where people choose to live and work.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses transportation convenience and accessibility** as a standard for evaluating the quality and desirability of urban areas.
  - The author **implicitly uses the functional livability of an area** (e.g., centrality, traffic conditions) as a criterion for defining or evaluating the ""local value"" of a region.
  - The author **does not explicitly use other criteria** (e.g., hukou, language, family history) to define ""local identity"", so these are not relevant for annotation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s core argument is centered on **how the functional livability and transportation convenience of an area affect its desirability and perceived ""local value""**.
  - The key RL category is **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author uses **transportation infrastructure and accessibility** as a standard for evaluating the quality of urban areas and their suitability for living.

RL1, RL3"," * The author is recounting personal and family history to establish a sense of ""authentic local"" identity in relation to the city of Hefei. They emphasize the contrast between the current urbanized Hefei and how it looked in the past, and how people like them were once seen as ""outsiders"" or from the outskirts. The author is trying to define who the ""real old Hefei people"" are, based on deep historical roots and personal experience of growth in the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我爷爷辈是肥东的"" → family historical rootedness
  * ""来市区还要花钱买合肥户口"" → administrative legitimacy
  * ""我出生在省立医院步行街"" → family historical rootedness
  * ""合肥人口才一百来万"" → implies a smaller, more tightly-knit local community
  * ""我上学是工大附中"" → family historical rootedness
  * ""合肥工业大学就在现在南一环那"" → implies territorial identity based on location
  * ""大学墙外就是农村田地"" → contrast between urban and rural, and how the city has changed
  * ""小时候爬墙过去炸菜地，趴祖坟"" → personal growth history
  * ""我们还被人说是郊区的"" → implies social perception of ""local"" vs. ""outsider""
  * ""你觉得真的老合肥有多少人"" → invites reflection on who qualifies as ""true locals""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **family historical rootedness** (RL3) as a central criterion for defining ""real locals"", including grandparents' origins, personal birthplace, and educational background.
  * **Administrative legitimacy** (RL2) is used to show how gaining ""local status"" used to be difficult, requiring the purchase of a local hukou.
  * The contrast between the current urban landscape and the past (e.g., rural fields outside the university) subtly implies **territorial identity** (RL1), especially in how the city has expanded and how people’s perceptions of what constitutes the ""core"" of Hefei have changed.
  * The author’s tone and the mention of being called ""suburban"" by others suggest an awareness of **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), where people are judged based on where they live or where they are from.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses **family historical rootedness** as a key criterion for being a ""true local"".
  * They also reference **administrative legitimacy**, but this is used more as background to show how difficult it was to become ""local"" in the past, not as a primary criterion.
  * The contrast between the past and present city, and the author’s own experience of being seen as ""suburban"", supports **socially conventional territorial identity** as a relevant RL.
  * No other RLs (e.g., cultural-linguistic recognition, functional livability, economic status, occupational symbolism) are mentioned or implied.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that people should use **family historical rootedness** (RL3) and **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) to define who is a ""true local"" in Hefei. They argue that ""real old Hefei people"" are those who have lived in the city for generations, whose families have deep roots in the region, and who have grown up as the city expanded from a smaller, more rural area into the modern urban center.

RL3"," * The author is discussing the concept of ""local identity"" in合肥 (Hefei), emphasizing that even though many people are considered ""local"" due to growing up in the city from a young age, they are not actually ""native-born"" or ""purebred locals."" The author highlights the blurred lines between ""local"" and ""non-local"" in the context of a historically immigrant city and challenges the idea of a purely native local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions coming to合肥 at age 3 (93年到合肥，从幼儿园到高中).
  * Refers to ""purely Hefei people"" (纯正的合肥人) as rare in their experience.
  * Describes how most people came with their parents in the 90s and speak Mandarin (普通话交流, 合肥话都不会讲).
  * Notes that many ""local colleagues"" likely also immigrated as children.
  * Suggests that people who came as young children are seen as local by others, but are not ""natively grown"" (不是土生土长的).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **challenging the traditional notion of what makes someone a ""true local""** by showing that even those who are seen as local (because they grew up in the city) are actually the children of immigrants.
  * The emphasis on **""from kindergarten"" (幼儿园就来了)** and **""growing up with parents in the 90s""** is used to **argue that early settlement and childhood growth in the city are key to being considered local**.
  * The author **implicitly accepts this as a legitimate criterion for local identity**, even while acknowledging it is not ""purely native.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **endorses the idea that growing up in the city from an early age, especially starting in kindergarten, is sufficient to be considered a ""local.""**
  * The author **implicitly accepts that this kind of early settlement is what most people use to define ""local identity"" in合肥.**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author discusses the **importance of early childhood settlement and growth in the city** as a key to being considered a ""local.""
  * The author **does not reject this logic** and even suggests it is **how most people in合肥 define ""local"" identity**, even if it is not ""purely native.""

They mention that there are many relocated residents (拆迁户) and that the elderly population is large, and although they clarify that this is not meant to be discriminatory, they suggest that the overall quality or behavior of the population is lacking.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses the **demographic characteristics** of the local population (older, less educated, many relocated residents).
  - They imply that these characteristics affect the **perceived quality** of the local population.
  - The author suggests that the **timing of development** and **historical settlement patterns** influence the identity or perception of the local people.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using **demographic and historical settlement patterns** (late development, many relocated residents) to explain or justify the **perceived lower quality** of the local population.
  - The **historical and demographic background** is being used to construct a narrative about who the ""local people"" are or are not, and what defines a ""good"" local area.
  - The author is **implicitly defining ""local identity""** through the lens of **settlement history** and **demographic composition**, and **evaluating the quality of the local population** based on these.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **using the settlement history and demographic background** (late development, many relocated residents) to **define or evaluate the local population**.
  - The author is **implicitly linking the timing of development and settlement patterns** to the **quality of the local population**, which supports their core argument.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is using **settlement history** (late development, many relocated residents) to **define or evaluate the local population**.
  - This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author is referencing the **historical and demographic background** of the local population to define or evaluate their identity.
  - The author is also **evaluating the quality of the local area** based on the **demographic and settlement characteristics**, which aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as they are using these characteristics to **evaluate the quality of the local area**.

However, the text **does not directly or indirectly use these observations to define ""local identity"" or to distinguish ""local people""** from others.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions traffic conditions and behavior, which could relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition) or RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism) if the author were using these to evaluate a ""good local"" area or judge who belongs there. However, the focus is on **traffic problems as a complaint**, not as a **standard for defining local identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the description of traffic behavior to express frustration or critique about the area's livability, but there is **no indication** that these behaviors are being used to **evaluate who is a ""local"" or what makes a place ""local""**. The author is not suggesting that these behaviors are **characteristic of local people**, nor are they used to **define or exclude**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

The author does not express any explicit opinion on what constitutes a ""local person"" or a ""local area"" in terms of identity or social belonging. The focus is on real estate and its price, not on defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions a specific area, a metro station, and housing developments. These could potentially relate to **RL1** (if the author is defining the boundary of a ""local area"") or **RL5** (if the author is evaluating the quality of the area based on livability or infrastructure).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The metro station and housing developments are mentioned in a descriptive and factual manner. The author is not using these to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the quality of a local area in terms of identity or belonging. There is no explicit or implicit judgment about who counts as a local or what makes a place ""local"" in a social or cultural sense.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

They mention that they were raised in **Luyang District** and believe that **accent** is the easiest way to distinguish people. They also mention that with more exposure, one can identify people based on **appearance and demeanor**, and that someone else can even distinguish people down to **two or three neighboring provinces**. The core intent is to explain how **regional identity** can be judged based on **language, appearance, and cultural familiarity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of being ""raised in Luyang District"" → possibly **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - Emphasis on **accent** as the easiest way to distinguish people → **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  - Mention of **appearance and demeanor** reflecting regional differences → possibly **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  - Mention of someone else being able to distinguish people by **regional origin** with high accuracy → supports **RL4** as a standard for regional identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author's **own growth history** (being raised in Luyang District) is used to establish **credibility** in judging regional identity.
  - **Accent** is presented as the **primary and most accessible criterion** for identifying regional identity.
  - **Appearance and demeanor** are described as **secondary but still effective** indicators.
  - The author is not using these as criteria to define who is or is not a ""local"" in a **socially exclusionary or administrative sense**, but rather as **tools for recognizing regional origin** and cultural background.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **accent and appearance** as ways to **identify regional identity**.
  - The **growth history** (Luyang District) is used to **support the credibility** of their judgment, but not as a **defining criterion** for ""local identity"" in the context of this text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is clearly supported, as the author emphasizes **accent** and **appearance/demeanor** as ways to distinguish people from different regions.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is **weakly relevant** but not used as a **defining criterion** for ""local identity"" in the current context, so it is **not annotated**.

The author appears to be **critiquing or observing** the behavior of newcomers and linking it to **economic motivations**, suggesting a **hierarchical or symbolic relationship between housing ownership and local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""新来的"" (newcomers)
  - ""疯狂踩老城区"" (crazily belittling the old city area)
  - ""赶上的房价最高的那一波"" (caught the wave of the highest housing prices)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""赶上的房价最高的那一波"" is key: it implies that the newcomers are **criticizing the old city area because they benefited from high property prices**. This suggests a **link between economic status (owning property at high prices) and a sense of legitimacy or superiority**.
  - The author implies that **being a local is not just about being there, but about economic investment and ownership**, and that newcomers are using their economic gain to **redefine or critique the value of local areas**.
  - The author is not merely describing this behavior but is **implying a standard for judging who is or isn't a ""true"" local** — someone who is **rooted in the area and not just taking advantage of it**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is suggesting that **the depth of one's economic investment and ownership in a local area is a criterion for legitimacy as a ""local""**.
  - The author **endorses the idea that economic rootedness (in the form of property ownership at high prices) is a significant factor in local identity**.
  - The author is also implying that **newcomers, who did not grow up in the area but now own property, use their economic position to redefine or look down on the old local area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as the author is implying that **owning property at high prices is a symbol of economic status and rootedness in the local area**, and that **newcomers use this to assert or redefine their local identity**.

They note that this shift has expanded the city's perceived scope and improved transportation, but express concern that public policies have not kept pace. The author hopes for continued improvement to make the city truly livable.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""合肥土著人"" (native of Hefei) suggests a sense of rootedness.
  - ""合肥的名片"" (Hefei's calling card) implies a redefinition of the city's identity.
  - ""从包拯故里改成大湖名城"" (from the hometown of Bao Zheng to Great Lake City) reflects a shift in the city's symbolic or cultural identity.
  - ""面积大了不少"" (much larger area) and ""交通也在变的便捷"" (transportation is becoming more convenient) suggest a functional and geographic expansion.
  - ""民生政策并没有积极跟上"" (public policies have not kept up) implies a critique of current livability standards.
  - ""希望越来越好，做到真正的宜居"" (hope it gets better and becomes truly livable) reflects a desire for improved functional livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The shift from ""Bao Zheng's hometown"" to ""Great Lake City"" is used to define a new identity for the city and its residents, which aligns with **RL1**.
  - The mention of the city's expanded area and improved transportation suggests the author is using **functional livability** as a criterion to evaluate the city's livability, aligning with **RL5**.
  - The author’s concern about public policies not keeping up with infrastructure development is a critique of the current state of livability, reinforcing the **RL5** perspective.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the **cultural and symbolic shift** in the city's identity as a new defining feature of the ""local"" area.
  - The author also implicitly uses **functional livability and environmental quality** as a standard for judging the city's quality as a ""local"" residential area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is evident in the author's reference to the shift from ""Bao Zheng's hometown"" to ""Great Lake City,"" which represents a change in the city's symbolic and cultural identity that defines the local area.

The author is suggesting that this has led to a relative disadvantage for Hefei locals when competing with new residents (outsiders), especially in terms of economic benefits from real estate.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author refers to ""本地人"" (locals) and contrasts them with ""外地人"" (outsiders) and ""新合肥人"" (new Hefei residents).
  * The author notes that locals in Hefei are not benefiting from rising property prices, unlike in Shenzhen.
  * There is a clear implication that **economic status and property ownership** are used to distinguish between different types of residents and to evaluate the **authenticity or strength of local identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The contrast between locals in Hefei and Shenzhen is based on **economic benefits from real estate**.
  * The author implies that **owning property and benefiting from rising housing prices** is a marker of **being a ""real"" or influential local**, and those who do not benefit are relatively disadvantaged.

有一说一之前去合肥，当地的阜阳口音是真的正宗啊,"**
RL4"," * The author is commenting on the authenticity of a local dialect (""阜阳口音"") in Hefei, implying that the dialect is a marker of local identity. The tone is casual and observational, but the mention of ""正宗"" (authentic) suggests that the author sees dialect as a legitimate standard for judging whether something (or someone) is ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""阜阳口音"" refers to a specific local dialect.
  * The word ""正宗"" (authentic) implies a cultural or linguistic standard for judging local identity.
  * The phrase ""当地的"" (local) is used to describe the dialect, reinforcing the idea that the dialect is a criterion for localness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The dialect is being described as ""authentic,"" which implies that the author sees it as a **marker of genuine local identity**.
  * The use of ""正宗"" suggests the author is **affirming the dialect as a legitimate standard** for judging who is a ""local"" in Hefei.
  * The author is not resisting or questioning this standard; rather, they are **implicitly endorsing** it through their tone and phrasing.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) as a criterion to define or judge ""local identity"".
  * The dialect is being used as a **symbol of authenticity** in local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that the **authenticity of a dialect** (阜阳口音) is a valid standard for judging whether something or someone is ""local"" in Hefei.
  * This fits **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is using dialect as a criterion for defining ""local identity"".

我老家也是大圩的欸，不过好像大圩拆迁房的房价并不高吧，是什么葡萄家园吧,"RL3, RL6"," * The author mentions their hometown is ""大圩"" and comments on the housing prices and property names in the area, suggesting a comparison or clarification between ""大圩"" and ""葡萄家园"" (Grape Homeland). The intent appears to be distinguishing between areas or property types in terms of value or identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""老家"" (hometown) – potentially linked to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness).
  * ""拆迁房"" (demolition/relocation housing) – potentially linked to RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism).
  * ""房价并不高"" (not high housing prices) – potentially linked to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  * ""葡萄家园"" (Grape Homeland) – a specific property name, possibly used to distinguish areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses ""老家"" to signal their personal connection to the area, which could be a sign of rootedness (RL3).
  * The mention of ""拆迁房"" and ""房价"" implies a judgment about the economic status or value of the area, which is relevant to RL6 and possibly RL5.
  * The reference to ""葡萄家园"" seems to be an attempt to clarify or distinguish between areas, potentially involving RL1 if it's about territorial identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author appears to be using their family background (老家) and property characteristics (拆迁房, 房价) to make a point about the area's value or identity. This suggests a potential endorsement of RL3 and RL6.
  * The author does not appear to be explicitly endorsing the use of property names (葡萄家园) as a criterion for defining ""local identity"", so it is not included.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's reference to their hometown (老家) is a clear indicator of RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness).
  * The author's discussion of housing prices and property types (拆迁房) is relevant to RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as it suggests a judgment about the economic status of the area.

None"," The author is expressing a negative opinion about the value and financial benefit of small apartment units obtained through a housing or relocation compensation policy. They are skeptical about the real economic benefit from such policies, especially in a local housing market where demand is low and property values are stagnant or declining.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Discussion of property ownership, small apartment size, and compensation (e.g., ""自己掏钱买的平方"", ""修不修好"", ""房价在这里"").
  - Mention of monthly housing subsidies (""每月租房补助"", ""人头补助"").
  - Implicit assumptions about the housing market (""根本没人买"", ""发财个毛啊"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not defining who is or is not a ""local person"" directly, but is discussing the **economic value of property** and **housing policies** in a local context.
  - The discussion of property ownership and compensation implies a **certain economic status** or **investment value** in the local area.
  - The author is **not using these elements to define ""local identity""** in terms of belonging or legitimacy, but rather to critique the **economic viability of local housing policies**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not use these elements to define or judge who is a ""local person""**.
  - The text **does not express a standard for judging local identity** but rather **discusses property value and compensation in a local housing market**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The content is **not about defining ""local identity""**, but rather about **housing economics and policy outcomes**.
  - The author is not asserting or implying that property ownership or housing subsidies are **criteria for being a ""local""**.

RL4"," * The author is reflecting on their generational experience of being immersed in Mandarin education, which has led to a disconnect from their native local dialect (presumably Anhui/Hefei dialect). The author notes that although they can understand the local dialect, their speech is marked by a different accent, which is perceived as non-local by a family member (their mother). The core intent is to highlight the linguistic and cultural disconnection caused by language policy and how it affects their perceived local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses language (Mandarin vs. local dialect), the influence of education on language, and the perception of one's accent as a marker of identity. These relate to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses their linguistic experience to illustrate how language and accent influence how one is perceived in terms of local identity. The fact that the author's mother questions their accent implies that speaking a non-local or ""weird"" accent undermines their perceived authenticity as a local person. The author's reflection on language education and its effects is used to explain why they feel linguistically disconnected from their local roots.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implies that speaking the local dialect fluently and with the correct accent is an important marker of local identity. The fact that the author can understand the dialect but cannot speak it naturally is used to highlight their non-local identity perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's discussion about language, dialect, and accent aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it shows how linguistic competence and accent are used to determine whether someone is considered a ""local.""

合肥四个行政区啊，为什么合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区,RL1," * The author is questioning why people from Hefei refer to the Hefei High-Tech Development Zone as an ""administrative district"" (行政区), even though it is not officially one of the four administrative districts of Hefei. The core intent is to express confusion or disagreement with this common regional labeling or identity attribution.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions the高新区 (High-Tech Development Zone) and compares it to the four ""administrative districts"" (行政区), implying a distinction between official administrative boundaries and popularly accepted ones.
  * The term ""行政区"" is used, which is a clear administrative boundary reference.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is pointing out a mismatch between the actual administrative classification and the popular or conventional regional identity.
  * This mismatch implies that people are using a **conventional or social understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" area**, rather than the **official administrative definition**.
  * The author seems to **implicitly criticize or question** this conventional usage, but the **conventional territorial identity** is still being referenced as a standard of how people identify the高新区 as part of the local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does **not explicitly endorse**高新区 as an administrative district, but they are **pointing out a social or conventional way of defining it as part of the ""local"" identity**, which is **not aligned with the official administrative framework**.
  * The **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** is being referenced through the author's questioning of why高新区 is treated as an administrative district in popular discourse.
  * There is **no endorsement of administrative legitimacy (RL2)** by the author, since they are highlighting the **discrepancy** between popular usage and administrative classification.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is highlighting how people **conventionally consider高新区 as a local area**, even if it is not officially an administrative district. This reflects the **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**, as the author is acknowledging that this **popular regional cognition** exists and is used to define who or what is considered ""local"" in social discourse.
  * The author does not express any strong support for高新区 being an administrative district, but the **existence of this popular belief** is a key point in their argument.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **administrative management (管委会)** and **administrative division (高新区)**.
  - Reference to **residential function (居民办事)**.
  - Mention of **property ownership (房产证)** and **ID card (身份证)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is emphasizing that **administrative jurisdiction (高新区管委会)** and **residential function (居民办事)** are more relevant to one's **perceived local identity** than the **ID card’s administrative division (身份证是蜀山区)**.
  - The **property ownership (房产证也是高新区)** is also used to reinforce the claim that the person is more functionally and administratively part of the高新区, not Shushan District.
  - The author is **implicitly rejecting the idea that an ID card from Shushan District alone is sufficient to define someone as a ""local""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **administrative division (高新区)** and **property ownership (房产证)** as criteria for defining local identity.
  - The author **implicitly rejects** the ID card (身份证) as a valid criterion for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** by referencing the高新区管委会 and高新区房产证 to define who is more authentically part of the高新区.
  - The author **does not endorse** the ID card (身份证) as a valid standard for defining local identity, so it is not included.
  - The author is not discussing historical roots, language, or cultural habits, so RL1, RL3, RL4, RL5, RL6, and RL7 are not applicable.

  * The author refers to their own personal living experience in瑶海 for five to six years, suggesting a personal growth or settlement history.
  * The author makes a comparison of development levels among districts.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""买东西真的很方便"" supports the author's assertion that瑶海 is a convenient and livable area, which is part of the author's evaluation of the area's ""local value"".
  * The personal experience of living in瑶海 for five to six years is used to reinforce the author's credibility in speaking about the area's livability and to affirm its status as a ""local"" area.
  * The author's comparison of development levels among districts is not used to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate who is ""local"", so it is not relevant to the RL criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author explicitly endorses the convenience and livability of瑶海 as a defining characteristic of its ""local value"", which fits RL5.
  * The author's personal growth and settlement history in瑶海 is used to affirm the authenticity of their perspective and their connection to the area, which fits RL3.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that the functional livability of an area (convenience of shopping) is a valid standard for evaluating the ""local value"" of a place (RL5).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions the **transportation system** (metro lines 1, 3, 4), **commercial facilities** (a commercial street with small eateries and奶茶店), **industrial status** (industrial zones, large factories like 京东方, 维信诺, 康宁), and **future development** (5-star hotels). These all relate to **functional livability and environmental quality**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses these elements to **evaluate the area's quality as a place to live**, noting its convenience but also its shortcomings (industrial nature, lack of vibrant commercial life, and limited relevance of future high-end developments to ordinary people). These observations suggest the author **uses functional livability and environmental quality as criteria to judge the ""value"" of a local area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses the area's transportation, commercial facilities, and industrial status as a basis for evaluating its livability and appeal**, which can be interpreted as **criteria for judging the ""quality"" of a local area**. These are **not just descriptions of the area but part of the author’s implicit evaluation of what constitutes a desirable or authentic ""local"" environment**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author seems to be using these criteria to **evaluate and define the quality or scope of local areas**, which indirectly contributes to the **construction of a ""local"" identity system**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""高新是大哥""** (Hi-tech is the big brother) – industrial strength.
  - **""滨湖是最舒服的""** (Binhu is the most comfortable) – environmental quality.
  - **""庐阳最有感觉""** (Luyang has the most vibe) – cultural atmosphere or ""local flavor"".
  - **""按行政区域来算，蜀山区无疑""** (By administrative area, Shushan District is definitely the top) – administrative legitimacy.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using **industrial strength, environmental comfort, cultural atmosphere, and administrative boundaries** to **evaluate the value and scope of local areas**, which indirectly reflects the **standards for what constitutes a ""good local area""** or a **legitimate part of the local identity system**.
  - The **administrative boundary** is used as a **formal criterion** to judge which area is most representative of the ""local"" identity.
  - The **environmental comfort and cultural atmosphere** are **subjective but meaningful indicators** of what makes an area feel ""local"" or desirable.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly uses administrative boundaries** to determine the most legitimate local area.
  - The author **uses environmental and cultural indicators** to judge the **quality or character of local areas**, which implies **standards for evaluating local value**.
  - These criteria are **endorsed by the author** and **serve the purpose of defining or evaluating the scope and quality of local areas**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author uses administrative boundaries (""按行政区域来算"") to determine the most representative local area (Shushan District), which is a clear endorsement of administrative legitimacy as a standard for defining local areas.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author evaluates Binhu as ""the most comfortable"" based on environmental quality, indicating the use of livability as a standard for judging the quality of a local area.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author refers to Luyang as having ""the most vibe,"" implying a conventional or socially recognized cultural atmosphere that contributes to the identity of a local area.

The core intent is to **assess the quality and appeal of these areas as places to live**, using factors like **transportation, educational resources, medical facilities, and development trends**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses **transportation convenience (""四通八达的地理位置"")**, **educational resources (""学区"")**, **medical facilities (""医院"")**, **development trends (""逐渐开始攀升"")**, and **environmental quality (""环境不行"")**. These are all potential indicators for evaluating livability and regional value.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **uses these elements to judge the livability and attractiveness** of each district, and by implication, whether they **meet the standard of a ""good local"" area**. The author is **not using these to define who is or is not a ""local person""**, but rather to **evaluate the quality of local areas**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not express any criteria for defining ""local people""**, only for **assessing the livability and development of different regions**. These assessments are **not framed as identity markers**, but rather as **factors for choosing where to live**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** is the only potentially relevant category, as the author **mentions livability factors** like transportation, schools, and hospitals. However, the author **does not use these to define ""local identity""**, only to **evaluate the quality of a place as a living environment**. Therefore, **RL5 is not applicable** under the strict definition of the task.

我说的近综合交通不就这样吗？,"**
None"," * The sentence is brief and lacks context. The author appears to be making a reference or rhetorical statement about ""comprehensive transportation proximity,"" possibly in the context of urban or regional livability. However, the text does not directly or implicitly define ""local identity"" or provide any criteria for determining who is a ""local."" The mention of ""comprehensive transportation"" could be related to evaluating the quality of a region but does not serve as a standard for defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The only potential element is the phrase ""近综合交通"" (proximity to comprehensive transportation), which could be linked to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as it refers to a quality of a living area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase is not elaborated upon, nor is it clearly used to define who is or is not a ""local"" or to judge the value of a local area in terms of identity. The author may be referring to a feature of a place, but there is no clear connection to the definition of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The phrase ""近综合交通"" does not serve as a criterion for defining local identity or evaluating local areas in terms of identity. It is not endorsed by the author as a standard for determining who is ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * Since the phrase is not used to define or evaluate local identity, no RL category is applicable.

我从地图上研究过，最方便的是华府骏苑那一块，距离各大商业区，银泰之心城万象城啥的，距离都比较平均。唯一缺点是周围好工作很少,**," * The author is evaluating the convenience and livability of a residential area (华府骏苑) based on its proximity to major commercial centers and its lack of nearby job opportunities. The intent is to assess whether this area is a desirable or ideal ""local"" place to live, not to define who qualifies as a ""local person.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions proximity to commercial centers and the lack of nearby job opportunities, which are features of a place's livability and functionality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using these features to evaluate the quality of the area as a place to live. However, there is no indication that these factors are being used to define who is or is not a ""local person,"" or to judge the boundaries of a ""local"" area in terms of identity or social recognition.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not using these features to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the legitimacy of a ""local"" area in terms of identity, but rather as a personal evaluation of the area's livability.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is discussing the functional livability of the area (e.g., proximity to commercial centers and job opportunities), which relates to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**. However, since the author is not using these to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the legitimacy of a region as ""local,"" this does not qualify for annotation.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * The text does not contain RL elements that are used to define ""local identity"" or evaluate ""local"" areas in terms of identity criteria.

**Output:**"
有车之后你就知道，老城区堵车几小时的堵,N/A," * The author is commenting on the traffic congestion in the old city area, and by doing so, is likely emphasizing the characteristics or quality of that area in terms of livability or functionality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""老城区"" (old city area) suggests a specific area that is being discussed.
  * The author is describing a negative functional characteristic of the area: traffic congestion.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of the ""old city area"" and its traffic congestion is used to highlight the area's poor livability or environmental quality.
  * The author is not directly using this to define ""local identity"", but the description of the area's poor functionality may imply a judgment about the quality of the local area, which could influence perceptions of ""local value"" or desirability.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is expressing a view about the functionality and livability of the old city area.
  * However, the text does **not** clearly indicate that the author is using this as a criterion to define who is or is not a ""local person"", or to evaluate the ""quality/scope/distinction of local areas"" in a way that is used to define local identity.
  * The statement is more of a general observation or complaint about traffic, not a definition of ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * While the text contains a description of a place's functionality (RL5), it does not serve the author's core argument in defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local"" areas from the perspective of local identity criteria.

  * These elements are primarily about the **functional livability** and **environmental quality** of the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of ""双地铁"" and ""4.6"" supports the idea that the area is convenient and has good infrastructure, which is a **positive functional livability** feature.
  * The reference to ""新房二手一起疯狂卷"" suggests that the housing market is competitive, which may affect the **perceived quality of the area**.
  * The mention of elevated roads (""五里庙和朗溪路高架"") introduces a **negative environmental factor** affecting the area's quality.
  * These elements are used to **evaluate the area’s livability and quality**, which indirectly relate to how one might judge whether it is a ""good local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is evaluating the **functional livability and environmental quality** of the area.
  * These are used to assess whether the area is a **desirable local living space**, which aligns with the criteria for **RL5**.

  * ""交通也不行"" (poor transportation)
  * ""设施也跟不上"" (facilities are not up to standard)
  * ""下雨就涝"" (floods during rain)
  * ""地震中心"" (earthquake-prone area)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are used to **criticize the livability and environmental quality** of Fudong. The author implies that these are **defining features of a ""bad local area""**, which contrasts with what might be considered a ""good local"" area. The attitude is clearly negative and evaluative.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **environmental and functional livability** as a **standard to evaluate the quality of a local area**, which is central to their argument.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

  * ""生活消费低"" (low cost of living)
  * ""交通方便"" (convenient transportation)
  * ""有烟火气"" (has a lively, community atmosphere)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are all used to portray Yaohai as a good place to live, which implies that the author considers such characteristics important in evaluating the ""quality"" of a local area. These are not used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" people, but rather to define what makes a place a good ""local"" living environment.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses the idea that a good ""local"" area should have convenient transportation, complete facilities, low living costs, and a vibrant community atmosphere. These are used to evaluate the ""quality"" of a local area, not to define who is or is not a ""local person.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * These elements match **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as they are used to evaluate the livability and quality of the local area, which is central to the author's argument.

The author seems to be expressing a positive evaluation of the area, possibly implying that it is a desirable or representative local area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我家门口有三号线地铁和能直通市中心的公交车"" (There is Line 3 subway and a bus that goes directly to the city center near my home)
  * ""区内有38中这样的好初中"" (There is a good junior high school, No. 38 Middle School, in the district)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The transportation and educational facilities are used to describe the area's quality and livability, which the author seems to view as positive characteristics of the area. These are not used to define who is or is not a ""local person,"" but rather to evaluate the area's value as a place to live, which may imply that the author considers it a good ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is evaluating the area's livability and convenience based on transportation and education, which are relevant to RL5. However, the author is not using these to define who is a ""local person,"" but rather to describe the area's quality.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The text fits RL5 because it describes the area's functional livability and convenience, which are used to evaluate the area's quality. However, since the author is not using these to define ""local identity"" but rather to describe the area's merits, the RL5 label is appropriate only if the author is using these to evaluate the area as a ""good local"" place.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * The author is not using these elements to define who is a ""local person,"" but rather to describe the area's livability. Therefore, the criteria do not qualify as being used to define ""local identity.""

However, they do not explicitly or implicitly use these as criteria to define ""local identity"" or evaluate who is a ""local."" The statement is more about lifestyle choice and affordability than about identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""房价贵了"" (high housing prices) could potentially relate to RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), but the author is not using it to define local identity or to judge someone as a local based on property ownership or economic status.
  * ""方便"" (convenient) might relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), but again, it is not framed as a standard for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of convenience and high housing prices functions as a personal observation or critique of living conditions, not as a criterion for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not using the mentioned factors (convenience, housing prices) to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the scope or quality of a ""local"" area. Therefore, no RL criteria are endorsed in the text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * No RL categories are applicable since the author is not defining ""local identity"" or using the mentioned elements as criteria for such a definition.

The core intent seems to be expressing a **sense of identity tied to the local area**, and how the **boundaries or scope of the “local” identity have shifted** as the city has developed.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions:
    - “去济南” (going to Jinan) — implies a **distinction between the author’s home area and the city center**, which used to be perceived as a separate place.
    - “济钢桥头有个374车站” (there was a 374 station at the Ji Gang bridge) — a **historical and geographical marker** of the area.
    - “编号是距离青岛站374公里” (the number meant 374 km from Qingdao Station) — **symbolic and geographic meaning** of the location.
    - “后面改叫韩仓站，现在废弃了” (later renamed to Hancang Station, now abandoned) — **change in the social and symbolic meaning** of the location.
    - “后来有了8路、10路公交车……现在公交、地铁一应俱全” (later there were buses 8 and 10… now public transport is fully available) — **urban development** and **changing perceptions of what is “local”**.
    - “不过不超过CBD（原二钢）还是电瓶车最方便” (but if you don’t go beyond the CBD [originally Er Gang], electric scooters are still the most convenient) — **implying a boundary** to what is considered the “core” local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the “Functional Role” of RL Elements in the Author’s Core Argument**
  - The author is using **historical and geographic markers** to show how the **boundaries of the local area have evolved**.
  - The **change in station names and the shift in transportation** reflect how the **author’s perception of what constitutes the “local” area has changed**.
  - The mention of **CBD and Er Gang** as a **practical boundary** for local life implies a **mental map** of the local area.
  - The author is not merely describing change, but using these elements to **construct a sense of local identity tied to spatial and temporal change**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **implicitly using historical, symbolic, and geographic markers** to define what is “local”.
  - The author **implicitly conveys a mental map** of the local area and how it has changed over time.
  - The **CBD and Er Gang** are used to define a **practical boundary** for local life, suggesting an **evaluation of what constitutes a “core” local area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of ""Zhangqiu"" and ""Jinan"" refers to specific geographic locations, which could relate to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author is referencing a past experience, which may imply a sense of **local rootedness**, but the connection is not strong enough to qualify for **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to Zhangqiu and Jinan is primarily geographic and not used to define or evaluate who is or is not ""local"" or to make a judgment about the quality or scope of the ""local"" area.
  * The mention of the toll station is more about the author's personal memory of travel logistics and infrastructure, not about identity or social recognition.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The geographic reference is present but not used to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or the ""local"" area.

  * They contrast their childhood experience with the present-day location of their home (Olympic Park), which they still refer to as ""going to the city center"" (泉城路), indicating a shift in what is considered the city center.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The described boundaries of the city (east, west, north, south) serve as a mental map of what the author considered the ""local"" area during their childhood.
  * The author implicitly uses this mental map to distinguish between what was once the ""city"" and what is now the ""city"", indicating a shift in the spatial understanding of ""local"" over time.
  * The reference to ""going to the city center"" from a new location (Olympic Park) shows how the author still implicitly uses the old mental map to define what is ""local"" or ""central"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses their childhood experience and perception of city boundaries to define what constituted the ""local"" area in Jinan.
  * This reflects a socially conventional territorial identity based on long-term personal and social experience.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's mental map of Jinan based on childhood experience aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author uses the boundaries they grew up with to define what was once the ""local"" area and contrasts it with the present-day spatial perception, showing how these territorial cognitions are used to evaluate or distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas.

**Output:**

我06的，家在市中区，现在往泉城路还习惯说是去市里,RL1," * The author is reflecting on how they still mentally associate the city center (""泉城路"") with the broader concept of ""the city"" (""市里""), despite growing up in the central urban district (""市中区""). This suggests a persistent regional identity tied to the city center, even for someone who grew up in the central area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""家在市中区"" (grew up in the central urban district) implies a personal connection to a specific area.
  * The phrase ""往泉城路还习惯说是去市里"" (still habitually refer to going to Quancheng Road as going to the city) implies a mental map or regional cognition of what counts as the ""city"" or core area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using their own upbringing and speech habits to illustrate a **shared or conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""city"" or core area**.
  * The habit of calling Quancheng Road ""the city"" implies a **territorial identity and mental map** that is **socially conventional**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not resisting or negating the idea that certain areas are more central or carry more symbolic weight in local identity.
  * The text reflects an **implicit assumption** about **how people from the central district still mentally categorize urban areas**, which aligns with the criteria for **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implicitly conveys a **socially conventional territorial identity** by showing how someone who grew up in the central urban district still mentally separates and refers to the city center as ""the city"", implying a **shared or historically sedimented way of defining local identity and spatial boundaries**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
看标题，2022年，我说的跟老市区没有一点关系,"**
RL1"," * The author is asserting that their statement has **no relation to the ""old urban area""**, possibly to distance themselves from it or to clarify their own identity or perspective.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""老市区"" (old urban area) suggests a **regional reference** that may imply a contrast between the author and this area.
  * The phrase ""跟...没有一点关系"" (has nothing to do with...) implies **a clear boundary or identity distinction**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **rejecting any association with the ""old urban area""**, which suggests a **self-defined boundary** between themselves and that area.
  * This implies a **regional identity** that the author **does not want to be associated with**, and may suggest that they see themselves as part of a different local identity.
  * The phrase ""老市区"" may also carry **historical and social connotations**, which are relevant to RL1.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **rejecting a specific area's identity**, which is part of a **regional identity framework**.
  * This implies that **the author uses the concept of ""old urban area"" as a boundary** to define their own identity, suggesting a **mental map or regional cognition**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""老市区"" and the author's **rejection of it** implies a **regional identity boundary** that is **socially conventional** and **emotionally or historically sedimented**.
  * The author is **implicitly defining who is ""local"" by excluding themselves from the ""old urban area""**, which is consistent with **RL1**.

所以并不是所有的老济南人都认准那一块，你要搞清楚，就天桥槐荫那块小时候呆了20年，等有钱买房了第一时间搬到领秀城附近，这才是老济南的缩影,RL6," The author is making a distinction between what it means to be a ""true"" or ""authentic"" old Jinan resident. The core argument is that simply having lived in a traditional area (like Tianqiao or Hailyin) for a long time does not make someone a ""true"" old Jinan person. Instead, the author implies that the real ""old Jinan"" identity is demonstrated by someone who, after gaining wealth, still chooses to live in a modern, presumably more desirable area (Lingxiucheng), which reflects a deeper, more flexible sense of rootedness and social positioning.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to traditional areas (Tianqiao, Hailyin) and the time spent there (""小时候呆了20年"").
  - Mention of economic status (""有钱买房了"") and choice of modern residential area (""领秀城附近"").
  - Implicit evaluation of what constitutes a ""true"" old Jinan person based on both historical residence and current living choice.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to traditional areas and long-term residence is **not** endorsed as the sole criterion for being a ""true"" Jinan person; rather, it is contrasted with the author’s preferred standard.
  - The economic status and choice of a modern residential area are **endorsed** as a better reflection of the ""true"" old Jinan identity.
  - The author is suggesting that being a ""true"" Jinan person is not just about historical residence, but about **how one uses economic power and lifestyle choices to affirm a sense of belonging**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **resists** the idea that simply living in a traditional area for a long time is sufficient for being a ""true"" old Jinan person.
  - The author **endorses** the idea that **economic status and current residential choice** are more meaningful in defining who is a ""true"" old Jinan person.
  - The author is using **economic status and current residential choice** as a criterion for evaluating the authenticity or depth of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author emphasizes the importance of **economic status and residential choice** as indicators of a deeper, more authentic local identity. The ability to move to a modern, desirable area and still be considered ""old Jinan"" suggests that economic status and property ownership are symbolic of local authenticity and influence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""Honglou"" and specific locations within it, such as the subway, park, night market, church, and museums. These could be interpreted as references to a local area or place, but **not as criteria for defining ""local identity.""**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**

There is **no indication** that the author is using these features to define who is or is not a local, or to evaluate the ""localness"" of a place in terms of identity or social legitimacy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The text does **not** contain any RL elements that are used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The author is focused on **recommending places to visit**, not on defining who is a local or what makes a place ""truly local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

They express a nostalgic or sentimental view of ""old Jinan"" as a small, historically significant area (within the city wall or moat), while also acknowledging the modern administrative expansion of Jinan, including the inclusion of Laiwu and Zhangqiu. The author is not resisting the expansion but is emphasizing the contrast between the traditional ""core"" of Jinan and its modern, expanded boundaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老济南只有护城河里面那一块"" suggests a **historical or emotional definition** of the local core area.
  - ""老济南画个小圈圈就好啦"" implies a **mental map** or **symbolic boundary** for ""local"" identity.
  - ""2022年的济南市区确实大了不少"" and ""济南扩建了好几次"" refer to **administrative expansion**.
  - ""莱芜章丘也并入济南了吧?"" shows awareness of **administrative changes**.
  - The overall tone implies that **historical and emotional definitions** of ""local"" differ from **administrative definitions**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **uses the idea of ""护城河里面"" as a symbolic boundary** to define the traditional ""old Jinan"" area, which is emotionally and historically significant.
  - The author **acknowledges the administrative expansion** of Jinan but contrasts it with the traditional definition.
  - The author **does not resist the expansion**, but rather accepts it as part of the city's development.
  - The author **does not use these elements to judge people**, but rather to **define the boundaries and scope of ""local"" Jinan**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses the idea that ""old Jinan"" is a small, historically and emotionally significant area**, defined by the city wall or moat.
  - The author **acknowledges administrative expansion** as a legitimate change, but **does not use it as the sole or primary criterion** for defining ""local"" identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** is clearly endorsed by the author through the reference to ""护城河里面那一块"" and the idea of ""画个小圈圈"", which represent a **historical and emotional boundary** of ""local"" identity.
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** is **acknowledged**, but **not endorsed as the main criterion** for defining ""local"" identity. The author recognizes it as part of the city's development but does not use it as the core logic for defining ""local"" people or areas.

RL1, RL3"," - The author is reflecting on how the concept of ""local"" or ""real Jinan"" has changed over generations. They contrast the older generations' view (centered on the city wall and the old city center) with their own (centered on the Second Ring Road), while still expressing a psychological boundary between ""inside the city"" and ""outside the city"", even as physical and economic development has blurred that line.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to ""护城河以里"" (inside the moat), ""全福"" (Quanfu), ""二环里"" (inside the Second Ring Road), and ""二环外"" (outside the Second Ring Road) implies a **geographical boundary**.
  - The author's family background (grandfather's view, the perception of aunts marrying out) suggests **intergenerational identity transmission**.
  - The author's own sense of where the city center is and where they feel ""at home"" suggests **subjective spatial cognition** and **evolving territorial identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The geographical references (moat, Second Ring Road) are used to define what counts as ""Jinan"" or ""the city center"" for different generations.
  - The mention of family and generational perspectives shows how **historical rootedness** and **social conventions** shape the perception of local identity.
  - The contrast between physical development and psychological boundaries highlights how **socially conventional territorial identity** remains strong despite urban expansion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **geographical boundaries** (moat, Second Ring Road) as markers of ""local identity"".
  - The author references **intergenerational views** (grandfather, aunt) to show how local identity is passed down and shaped by family history.
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **psychological and socially conventional territorial identity** (what people consider ""the real city"") is more powerful than physical development in defining who is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** is clearly present, as the author discusses how different generations define the city's core area based on socially accepted boundaries (moat, Second Ring Road) and emotional attachments.
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** is also present, as the author references the grandfather's and their own views to show how local identity is tied to generational upbringing and family roots.
  - The author is **not using administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic traits, economic status, or occupational symbolism** to define local identity, so these RLs are not applicable.

批发市场不是市区吗？？你家的批发市场在农村啊？？,RL1," - The author is questioning the assumption that a ""wholesale market"" is located in the urban area, and is surprised or skeptical that someone's wholesale market would be in the countryside. The core intent is to **challenge the idea that ""wholesale market"" is inherently urban**, and to question the **geographical legitimacy** of a ""local"" or ""urban"" identity based on the location of such a market.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""批发市场"" (wholesale market) is mentioned in the context of urban/rural location.
  - The author questions the idea that a wholesale market is necessarily in the city and implies that this is a **common assumption or standard**.
  - The author's questioning suggests that **location** plays a role in defining what is considered ""urban"" or ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the **assumed urban location of a wholesale market** to challenge the **territorial identity logic** that equates certain places or features with being ""urban"" or ""local"".
  - The questioning implies that the **urban/rural boundary** is a **socially conventional territorial identity** standard.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **implicitly challenging** the assumption that a wholesale market is in the city, which suggests that **urban identity** is being judged based on **location of infrastructure or commercial centers**.
  - The author is questioning the **socially conventional territorial identity** that equates certain commercial features with being ""urban"" or ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **questioning a socially conventional territorial identity** that equates certain commercial features (like wholesale markets) with being urban or local.

They feel that people from other districts in Jinan dismiss or mock their claim to being ""Jinan locals"" after they mention having gone to university. The author is defending the legitimacy of their local identity and questions why Zhangqiu is not treated with the same respect or status as other districts in Jinan.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""章丘人"" – implies a territorial identity and a sense of belonging.
  * ""说自己是济南的"" – suggests that the author sees Zhangqiu as part of Jinan, but others may not agree.
  * ""别的区的觉得我碰瓷"" – indicates a perception of social segregation or exclusion based on territorial identity.
  * ""说的和我们很想并入你们一样"" – implies a historical or emotional desire for inclusion, and possibly a sense of being marginalized.
  * ""章丘市不比区大气啊？"" – suggests a comparison of social status or prestige between Zhangqiu and other Jinan districts, possibly rooted in historical or administrative status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is defending their identity as a ""Jinan local"" despite being from Zhangqiu, which is treated differently by others.
  * The phrase ""别的区的觉得我碰瓷"" implies that Zhangqiu is not universally recognized as a core part of Jinan in terms of social identity, suggesting a territorial and social segregation.
  * The author is implicitly questioning the legitimacy of the administrative or social hierarchy between Zhangqiu and other Jinan districts, which may be based on historical or current administrative divisions.

  * The author is also implying that **Zhangqiu is not treated as equal in status to other Jinan districts**, suggesting a social hierarchy or exclusion based on administrative or historical recognition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is defending their local identity by asserting that Zhangqiu is part of Jinan, but is met with resistance from others who do not see it that way. This aligns with **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, as the author is expressing a sense of belonging and regional identity that is being contested.
  * The author is also implying that **Zhangqiu is not treated as equal to other districts**, which may be due to **administrative or historical legitimacy**, aligning with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.
  * There is no clear mention of family history, language, or economic status as criteria for defining local identity, so **RL3, RL4, RL5, RL6, and RL7** are not applicable.

They suggest that the newly incorporated areas do not benefit from Jinan and instead feel exploited. The author implies that the ""real Jinan"" is the original city center, and that the expanded Jinan has diluted its identity or value.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""被划进来的"" (incorporated) – possibly relates to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  * ""纯纯被济南吸血"" (purely bled dry by Jinan) – may relate to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** or **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, but only if tied to identity.
  * ""光靠济南市区早就让烟台超了"" (Jinan's original city alone would have been overtaken by Yantai long ago) – implies a **historical or traditional core** of Jinan, possibly **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""被划进来的"" implies a **rejection of administrative incorporation** as a legitimate basis for defining ""local identity"" and suggests that the author sees the original Jinan as the true ""local"" area.
  * The author **implicitly defines ""real Jinan"" as the original city center**, and sees the expanded Jinan as artificial or less legitimate in terms of identity.
  * The economic reference ""被济南吸血"" is **not used to define who is a ""local""**, but rather to express a grievance about economic exploitation, so it is **not relevant** for this task.
  * The comparison with Yantai is used to **highlight the historical or traditional value of the original Jinan**, which plays into a **conventional territorial identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **rejects the idea of administrative expansion** as a valid way to define ""local identity"", so **RL2 is not endorsed**.
  * The author **implicitly defines the ""real local"" area as the original Jinan**, which fits **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **implicitly conveys** a **socially conventional territorial identity**, where the original Jinan is the legitimate or authentic ""local"" area, and the newly incorporated regions are seen as artificial or not truly part of the ""local"" identity.

The author is surprised by the roommate's excitement and feels the bus is not a rare novelty, as they themselves remember using it in the past. The core intent is to contrast the author's and their peers’ nonchalant attitude toward the bus with the roommate's exaggerated reaction, possibly implying a sense of regional pride or unfamiliarity with the local culture.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The mention of Licheng District (历城区) and the fact that the roommate is from there.
  - The roommate's emphasis on the bus being ""from her area"" (她们那边).
  - The contrast between the roommate's excitement and the author's and peers’ indifference.
  - The author's implication that double-decker buses are not new or special to them, suggesting familiarity with the local area and its history.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of Licheng District and the roommate being from there is used to **establish a regional identity boundary**—the roommate identifies with the area and feels a sense of pride or ownership.
  - The author and their peers, who also ""grew up"" using the double-decker buses, are **implicitly positioned as ""locals""** by their familiarity and indifference.
  - The author is subtly **contrasting ""local"" and ""non-local"" perspectives**—the roommate, possibly from a different background or less familiar with the area’s history, treats the bus as something new and special, while the author and peers do not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly uses **growth history and familiarity with local features (double-decker buses)** to distinguish between those who are truly ""local"" and those who are not.
  - The author **endorses the idea that being raised in the area and having lived experience with its features is a marker of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author contrasts their own and their peers’ upbringing with the roommate's unfamiliarity with the local feature (double-decker bus), which implies that **growing up in the area and having lived experience with its features is a criterion for being a ""local.""**

龙洞似乎并不介意自己属不属于济南市区，只知道自己最贵就可以了,RL6," * The author is making a humorous or ironic observation about the area of Longdong, implying that it doesn't care about administrative or territorial classification, but rather focuses on its economic value (""most expensive""). The author may be indirectly commenting on how economic status or property value can define a place's significance or perceived status.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""most expensive"" suggests a reference to economic status.
  * The mention of ""belonging to Jinan city area"" relates to administrative legitimacy.
  * The author's tone implies a contrast between formal classification and actual value or status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""Belonging to Jinan city area"" (administrative legitimacy) is mentioned, but the author does not endorse it as a defining criterion — instead, the author implies that Longdong does not care about this.
  * The author's focus is on economic value (""most expensive""), which is used to highlight the area's perceived importance or status. This implies that economic status may be a more relevant or meaningful criterion than administrative classification.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does **not** endorse administrative legitimacy as a criterion for defining the area's status — in fact, the author suggests it is irrelevant.
  * The author **does** imply that economic value (""most expensive"") is a meaningful indicator of the area's status, though not necessarily as a criterion for ""local identity"" in the traditional sense. However, the author's tone suggests that economic value may influence how the area is perceived or valued within the broader region.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The reference to ""most expensive"" aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as it implies that economic value can symbolize the area's status or perceived importance.
  * The author does not explicitly use economic status to define who is a ""local,"" but rather to comment on the area's value, which could indirectly influence how the area is perceived or evaluated. This aligns with the symbolic aspect of economic status in defining the ""value"" or ""authenticity"" of a place.

你画的小商品批发市场有汽车站有动物园的 也不算市区啊,RL1," * The author is making a claim about what **does not count as the city center (""市区"")**, and is **rejecting** the idea that the presence of certain commercial or public facilities (like a wholesale market, bus station, zoo) is sufficient to define a place as part of the core urban area. The author is implicitly setting a standard for what qualifies as the ""real"" or ""true"" city center.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""小商品批发市场"" (small commodity wholesale market), ""汽车站"" (bus station), ""动物园"" (zoo), and ""市区"" (urban area). These are all spatial and functional descriptors that may relate to the definition of a local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **arguing that the presence of these facilities is not enough to define a place as part of the city center**. This suggests a **standard for what does or does not count as ""市区""**, which is a **territorial definition** of the local area.
  * The author is **implicitly endorsing a more exclusive or conventional understanding of what constitutes the core urban area**, and is **rejecting a more functional or infrastructural definition**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **rejecting the idea that functional infrastructure (markets, transportation, zoos) is sufficient** to define a place as part of the city center.
  * The author is **implying that there is a conventional or socially accepted understanding of what the city center is**, and that this is **not determined by the mere presence of such facilities**.
  * This aligns with the idea of a **socially conventional territorial identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **socially conventional criteria** to determine what is or is not part of the ""市区"", and is **rejecting a more functional or infrastructural definition**.
  * The author is **implying a boundary or standard** for what counts as the ""real"" city center, based on **long-accumulated social habits or emotional attachment**, not just physical infrastructure.

很小的时候去济南，觉得历城就是郊区了，至于莱芜，我们本来就是刚合过去的，大多数的莱芜人在归属感上还是认同自己是莱芜人，个人观点不喜勿喷,RL1," - The author is reflecting on their early perception of geographical areas in Jinan and expressing a personal view about the sense of identity and belonging among people from Laiwu after its administrative merger with Jinan. The core intent is to highlight that despite the administrative change, many Laiwu residents still identify themselves as Laiwu people, not as part of Jinan.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""历城就是郊区了"" — suggests a perception of the area's status within Jinan.
  - ""莱芜，我们本来就是刚合过去的"" — references the administrative merger and implies a shift in jurisdiction.
  - ""大多数的莱芜人在归属感上还是认同自己是莱芜人"" — directly discusses the sense of identity and belonging tied to a place despite administrative changes.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the idea of administrative change to contrast the legal or administrative definition of ""local"" with the persistent self-identification of Laiwu people.
  - The author implicitly critiques the administrative legitimacy as a basis for defining local identity, emphasizing instead the enduring cultural and emotional ties of people to their place of origin.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **rejects administrative legitimacy** as the sole or primary basis for defining local identity.
  - The author **endorses a more culturally rooted or historically grounded identity**, implying that people’s sense of self-identification is more important than administrative status.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's emphasis on the persistence of Laiwu identity despite the administrative merger aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects long-standing emotional and cultural ties to a place.
  - The reference to the administrative merger and the author's view that it does not override self-identification aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, but in a **resisted** or **questioned** form, not endorsed.

RL3, RL4"," * The author reflects on their own lack of ability to distinguish local accents compared to their father, and expresses confusion or surprise that such a small area (e.g., Zhangqiu and Jinan) can have accent differences. This suggests a contrast between generational familiarity with local linguistic features and a sense of detachment from or reduced sensitivity to such local cultural markers.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions the father's ability to distinguish between accents from different local areas (""东西南北四关的口音差异"") and contrasts it with the author's inability to differentiate even between Zhangqiu and Jinan accents.
  * The author also questions how such a small area can have accent differences, which may reflect a lack of cultural-linguistic rootedness or a sense of not being fully part of the local linguistic culture.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The contrast between the father's and the author's linguistic sensitivity implies that the author may be less connected to the local cultural-linguistic identity.
  * The confusion about accent differences in a small area may suggest a lack of cultural-linguistic recognition, which can be a criterion for determining whether someone is ""local"" or not.
  * The author's tone suggests that being able to distinguish local accents is a marker of local identity, at least in the speaker's perception.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly endorses the idea that **linguistic and accentual recognition** is a meaningful marker of local identity.
  * The generational contrast also implies that **deep cultural-linguistic rootedness** (as demonstrated by the father) is associated with a stronger local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's reflection on their inability to distinguish local accents, contrasted with their father's ability, supports **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author implies that linguistic sensitivity is a key criterion for identifying someone as a ""local.""
  * The generational contrast also supports **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the father's deep familiarity with local linguistic features suggests a long-standing connection to the area, while the author's detachment may reflect a more recent or less rooted identity.

RL2"," * The author is discussing the administrative boundaries of a region (likely Jinan, Shandong), noting that some areas belong to Lixia District and others to Licheng District, while explicitly stating that the ""High-tech Zone"" (高新) is **not** an administrative division. The core intent is to clarify or correct a misconception about what constitutes an official administrative unit in this context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text references **Lixia**, **Licheng**, and **High-tech Zone**, and discusses whether these areas are considered **administrative divisions**.
  * The phrase ""不是行政区划"" (""is not an administrative division"") is a clear reference to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, which is concerned with defining ""local"" identity or regional scope based on **legal and administrative boundaries**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **correcting the assumption** that the High-tech Zone is an administrative unit.
  * This correction implies that **only officially recognized administrative divisions** (like Lixia and Licheng) are legitimate for defining **administrative-based local identity**.
  * The author **explicitly endorses** the **administrative legitimacy framework** as a criterion for determining whether a place is a **""local"" administrative area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **rejects** the High-tech Zone as an administrative unit, and **affirms** Lixia and Licheng as such.
  * This is a **clear endorsement of administrative legitimacy** as a standard for defining **what counts as a ""local"" administrative area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **uses administrative legitimacy (RL2)** to define what constitutes a ""local"" administrative area.
  * The **function** of this RL element is to **distinguish between areas that are officially recognized and those that are not**, thereby **establishing the legitimacy of ""local"" administrative identity**.

RL1, RL5, RL6"," The author is describing different districts in Jinan, mentioning their characteristics, personal experiences, and general perceptions. The core intent seems to be to share a personal mental map or understanding of the city and its districts, particularly in terms of functionality, accessibility, and social status.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions different districts and their features (e.g., “设施齐全” for 历下, “绿化挺好” for 高新).
  - There is a clear sense of social status associated with 高新 (""都是上流社会的人"").
  - The author notes where they personally go and their childhood memories (e.g., 天桥).
  - The author distinguishes between areas that are considered ""in the city"" (市里) and those that are not (e.g., 章丘、长清、平阴).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **functionality and accessibility** (e.g., 历下:设施齐全, 天桥:小时候买衣服长大了搞装修) to describe and evaluate the districts.
  - The author uses **social status** (e.g., 高新:上流社会) as a standard for evaluating the character of a district.
  - The author implicitly defines the **city core** by stating which districts are considered “in the city” and which are not.
  - These descriptions are used to build a **personal mental map** of the city and its districts, with the implicit purpose of distinguishing between different areas and their value or status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author uses **functional livability** (e.g., facilities, accessibility) and **environmental quality** (e.g., good greenery) to describe and evaluate districts.
  - The author implicitly defines the **boundaries of the city** based on social recognition and current consensus.
  - The author uses **social status** (e.g., being an upper-class area) as a criterion to evaluate a district's character.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL5** is clearly used to describe and evaluate districts based on their functional livability and environmental quality.
  - **RL1** is also present, as the author implicitly defines the boundaries of the city and the value of different areas based on their own mental map and social consensus.
  - **RL6** is partially present, as the author refers to 高新 as an area of the upper class, indicating economic status as a symbolic element in the author's perception of the district.

红谷滩，不过生活成本也相对高一些,"**
None"," - The author briefly mentions ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan), likely referring to a well-known urban area in Nanchang, and notes that the cost of living there is relatively high. The core intent seems to be a general observation about the area, possibly indicating it is a desirable or central place, but with a trade-off in terms of living expenses.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan): This could relate to a recognized urban area, possibly with symbolic or functional significance.
  - ""生活成本也相对高一些"" (the cost of living is relatively high): This could be linked to perceptions of livability or economic status, potentially reflecting how the area is evaluated in terms of desirability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""红谷滩"" is mentioned without further elaboration on identity or belonging, so it is not clear whether the author is using it as a marker of local identity.
  - ""生活成本也相对高一些"" is a general observation about the economic aspect of the area. It is not clearly tied to how the author defines or evaluates ""local identity.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The text does not provide enough information to determine whether the author is using the location or the cost of living as a standard for defining ""local people"" or evaluating local areas. It is a descriptive statement rather than a normative or evaluative one regarding identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The text lacks the necessary context or explicit/implicit criteria that the author uses to define ""local identity."" It is a general observation about a place and its cost of living, not a definition or evaluation of who is ""local"" or what makes an area ""local.""

RL5"," * The author is defining what constitutes the ""city center"" (市中心), emphasizing that it is not about tradition but rather about the presence of cultural, educational, medical, and commercial functions. The author is asserting that the true city center is where these advanced urban functions are concentrated, and it is tied to the concept of the CBD (Central Business District).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions the ""city center"" and defines it by the presence of cultural, educational, medical, and commercial facilities.
  * The author rejects the idea that tradition determines what is a city center.
  * The author references the CBD as a key indicator of where the city center is located.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the **presence of functional urban facilities and services** (cultural, educational, medical, commercial) as a **defining standard** for what constitutes the city center.
  * This is used to **reject traditional or sentimental definitions** and to support a **modern, functional, and economically-driven view** of the city center.
  * The author is **explicitly endorsing** the use of these functional features as the basis for defining the city center.

  * ""对老南昌人来说市中心就是八一广场附近的商圈"" (for old Nanchang people, the city center is the commercial area around Bayi Square) – relates to RL1.
  * ""三十四年以前 二七北路都是郊区"" (34 years ago, Erqi North Road was still a suburb) – relates to RL1, indicating a historical and social perception of the city's boundary.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The generational presence in the urban area (""三代都在市区"") is used to affirm the speaker's claim to being a ""purebred local"".
  * The definition of the city center as the Bayi Square area and the historical perception of Erqi North Road as a suburb serve to construct a **socially conventional mental map** of the city and reinforce the speaker's insider status.
  * The speaker implicitly uses these territorial and historical markers to distinguish between what constitutes ""local"" and what does not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The speaker endorses the idea that being a ""local"" is defined by **generational rootedness** and **territorial identity based on historical and social consensus**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The speaker aligns with RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness) by emphasizing three generations living in the urban area.

RL6"," * The author is making a statement about different central areas in Nanchang, suggesting that their ""best"" status is determined by housing prices, with Honggutan being the top in that regard.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""房价"" (housing prices) as a criterion for judging the best area.
  * The phrase ""如果说哪里最好，按照房价来"" (if we are to say which is best, by housing prices) implies a ranking logic.
  * The mention of ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan) as the top area under this criterion suggests the use of economic indicators for evaluation.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The housing price is used as a standard to judge the ""best"" area in Nanchang.
  * This implies that the author **endorses economic status (reflected in housing prices)** as a criterion for evaluating the value or status of a local area.
  * The author is not merely describing the situation, but is using housing prices to **establish a hierarchy among areas**, which can be interpreted as a standard for defining or evaluating the ""local"" value of a region.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses economic status (housing prices) as a **ranking criterion for local areas**.
  * This is not just a descriptive statement but is used to **evaluate and define the ""best"" local area**, which aligns with the RL criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses economic status (reflected in housing prices) to **evaluate the quality or status of a local area**, which is a key feature of **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

老南昌人，现在从红谷滩区老城区还是习惯说“去市内”,"**
RL1"," * The author is highlighting a linguistic and cultural habit of ""old Nanchang people"" — that is, those who have deep roots in the city. The phrase “去市内” (go to the city center) reflects a conventional way of referring to the old part of the city, even when the administrative or geographic center has shifted to Honggutan District. The author is emphasizing how this language use is part of a shared cultural identity among ""old locals.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase “老南昌人” (old Nanchang people) points to a group with generational or historical roots in the area.
  * The continued use of “市内” (city center) reflects a conventional mental map or territorial identity that is not necessarily aligned with administrative or geographic changes.
  * The implication is that this language and cognitive habit is part of what makes someone a ""local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is showing how language and mental maps are used to define who is a ""local"" — those who still use traditional terms and have an emotional or historical connection to the old city center.
  * The author is implicitly endorsing the idea that this kind of regional cognition and historical attachment is a valid basis for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **regional cognition** and **historical emotional attachment** to define who is a ""local"" — this fits RL1.
  * There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or occupational symbolism, so these RL categories are not relevant.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using the traditional mental map of the city and the continued use of the term “市内” to distinguish between ""old locals"" and others who may not share this conventional understanding. This is a clear example of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a shared, historically sedimented way of defining local identity.

The author clearly believes that the true city center is around Bayi Square (八一广场), and that the concentric ring designations (一环, 二环) are based on this traditional center. The phrase ""说红谷滩的 真的笑死"" (""those who say Red Flag Beach—really funny"") indicates a dismissive attitude toward Red Flag Beach being framed as a central or important area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""市中心是八一广场那边"" (the city center is around Bayi Square)
  - ""所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散"" (the so-called first and second rings are also expanded outward from Bayi)
  - ""说红谷滩的 真的笑死"" (those who say Red Flag Beach—really funny)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the traditional center (Bayi Square) as a **benchmark for defining the city center and its surrounding areas**. This implies a **historically or socially accepted mental map of the city**.
  - The author **rejects the idea of Red Flag Beach as a central area**, suggesting it is not recognized as part of the ""true"" local core by the author.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **Bayi Square as the central reference point** for defining the city's structure and local identity.
  - The author **implicitly resists** the idea of Red Flag Beach as a legitimate or central part of the city, based on the traditional mental map.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **explicitly endorsing a traditional, socially conventional mental map of the city**, using Bayi Square as the core and the concentric rings as a result of that center. This is consistent with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

They emphasize that the traditional city center is a specific area (Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road), while Honggutan is a newer, developed area with many outsiders. The author implies that being a ""local"" is tied to being from the historically central area, and that Honggutan, despite its development, is associated with a different kind of population.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土生土长南昌人"" (native Nanchang person) suggests a deep personal connection to the area.
  * ""南昌的市中心是东湖区八一广场中山路孺子路等那一片"" (the city center of Nanchang is the area around Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road) implies a historically or socially accepted definition of the core area.
  * ""红谷滩以前很荒废，后来发展起来的"" (Honggutan was once very undeveloped, but later developed) introduces a contrast between traditional and newly developed areas.
  * ""红谷滩那边很多外地人"" (there are many outsiders in Honggutan) suggests a demographic shift and an implicit judgment about who is considered ""local.""
  * ""但现在确实红谷滩发展的很好"" (but now Honggutan has indeed developed well) is a neutral observation about the area's development.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the concept of being a ""native Nanchang person"" to establish their authority in defining what counts as the city center.
  * The specific mention of traditional areas (Bayi Square, etc.) and the contrast with Honggutan serves to establish a **mental map of local identity**.
  * The statement about many outsiders in Honggutan implies that **being from the traditional area is a stronger claim to ""local"" identity** than being from a newer, developed area.
  * The author's attitude is one of implicit judgment: the traditional area is the true city center and the core of local identity, while Honggutan, despite development, is associated with outsiders.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly defines the traditional city center and implicitly uses this to distinguish between locals and outsiders.
  * The contrast between the traditional area and the newer area (Honggutan) is used to establish **regional cognition and identity boundaries**, which is central to the author's definition of ""local.""
  * The author does not explicitly resist or negate this logic; rather, it supports their core argument.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** by defining the core area of the city based on historically accepted locations and contrasting it with a newer area associated with outsiders.

  - They mention ""traffic radio"" as a source of public consensus on directional labeling (""outbound direction"" to Honggutan).
  - The author contrasts being ""natively born"" with general public perception.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using **publicly accepted directional language and communication habits** (traffic radio) to argue that Honggutan is not the city center.
  - They are **rejecting the idea that being ""not native"" negates the legitimacy of public perception**, suggesting that general usage is a valid standard for defining city center identity.
  - The argument is based on **how the city is mentally mapped and socially recognized**, not on administrative or personal history.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses the socially accepted mental map and communication habits** to define the city center, implying that this is the valid standard for defining local spatial identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that the **socially conventional territorial identity**, as reflected in **traffic radio terminology and directional language**, is the valid standard for defining the city center. This implies that **public perception and communication habits** are used to judge the legitimacy of spatial identity.

  * The author references **administrative divisions** (""行政区域划分""), and **geographical proximity due to improved transportation** (""不管地铁还是开车一会就到了"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The **administrative boundary** is the central criterion the author uses to define ""local identity"".
  * The **modern transportation** is used to counter historical perceptions of separation and to justify the inclusion of these areas under the same ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **explicitly endorses** using **administrative boundaries** as the basis for defining who is a ""local"".
  * The author also **implicitly implies** that **geographical proximity and accessibility** can influence how ""local"" an area is perceived, but this is not used as a formal criterion for defining identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author clearly states that **administrative division** is the key to defining local identity, which aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  * The author's discussion of improved transportation and reduced perceived distance **does not serve as a criterion for defining local identity**, but rather as a contextual observation. Therefore, it does **not** fall under RL1 or any other category.

The author seems to be evaluating the degree to which these cities can be considered part of the same regional or cultural identity as Qingdao, with a focus on infrastructure and cultural markers.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""口音"" (accent), ""地铁"" (subway), and ""机场"" (airport), which are potential indicators of cultural or functional identity.
  * The comparison between cities implies a value judgment about what constitutes a ""real"" local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of ""口音"" (accent) is used to suggest that Laixi and Pingdu are almost on par with Qingdao in terms of local identity, with only the accent being a remaining distinguishing factor.
  * The mention of ""地铁"" (subway) and ""机场"" (airport) in Jiaozhou is used to argue that Jiaozhou is more ""Qingdao-like"" or closer to the core Qingdao identity due to its infrastructure.
  * The author is using these features to **evaluate and compare the degree to which different cities can be considered part of the Qingdao ""local"" identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **cultural-linguistic markers** (accent) and **functional livability** (subway, airport) as criteria to judge the ""localness"" of different cities relative to Qingdao.
  * These are **explicitly used by the author to define or evaluate the scope and quality of a ""local"" area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author is implicitly defining what counts as ""local"" by comparing different cities and suggesting that Laixi and Pingdu are not quite ""Qingdao"" due to cultural and infrastructural differences.
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author uses the accent as a marker of identity, implying that it is a key criterion for being considered ""local.""

The author implies that these conditions are the **reason for the formation of the hierarchy**, and they **reject** the idea that such factors should define ""local identity"" in a meaningful or legitimate way.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * - ""市南区"" (Shinan District) and ""别的区"" (other districts) indicate **territorial distinctions**.
  * - ""住楼房"" (live in apartments) vs. ""平房"" (shanty houses) suggest **housing quality** as a differentiator.
  * - ""交通不便利，出行远环境破旧"" (inconvenient transportation, long commutes, run-down environment) are **functional livability factors**.
  * - ""出现的鄙视链"" (hierarchy of contempt) implies a **social judgment** or **ranking** of local identity based on these factors.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * - The author **rejects** the legitimacy of the ""hierarchy of contempt"" and **attributes it to outdated or superficial factors** like housing and transportation.
  * - They **do not endorse** using these factors to define who is or is not a ""local"", but instead **expose them as the basis for social prejudice**.
  * - The author **implies** that the Sinan District is seen as ""more local"" or ""higher status"" due to these factors, but **does not affirm** this as a valid standard.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * - The author **does not endorse** using housing quality or functional livability as a standard for defining ""local identity"".
  * - The author **does not affirm** the legitimacy of territorial-based identity rankings.
  * - The author **does not support** the idea that economic or environmental conditions should determine who is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * - The **RL5** category is **mentioned** but **not endorsed** by the author. The author **critiques** the idea that housing and transportation define ""local value"", and thus **does not use it as a legitimate standard**.
  * - The **RL1** category is **implied** in the territorial distinction between ""市南区"" and ""别的区"", but the author **does not affirm** this as a valid standard for identity. Instead, they **reject** the idea that such distinctions create a legitimate hierarchy.
  * - No other RL categories are clearly **endorsed** by the author in the text.

The core intent is to highlight how **regional development and improved infrastructure** can change the perception and status of an area, thus influencing its ""local identity"" or the perception of its residents as ""local people.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses **regional development**, **infrastructure improvements**, and **changing perceptions of area quality**.
  * The phrase ""新建的配套什么的都比原先的好"" (the new facilities are all better than before) suggests an evaluation of **livability and environmental quality**.
  * The comparison to **Laoshan**, a well-known and desirable area, implies that **area quality** is a standard for defining the ""local"" or ""desirable"" area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **improved facilities and infrastructure** as a criterion to argue that **Shinan** has become a more valuable and recognized area.
  * The comparison to **Laoshan** functions to **validate the improved status** of Sinan, implying that **area quality** is a key factor in how a region is defined or evaluated as a ""local"" area.
  * The author's attitude is **positive** towards areas with **improved functional livability**, and this is used to support the claim that such areas can rise in status and be recognized as ""local"" or core urban areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **improved infrastructure and facilities** can change the status and perception of a region.
  * The author **implicitly conveys** that such **functional livability and environmental quality** are used to evaluate or define the ""value"" or ""local status"" of an area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's focus on **new facilities and improved infrastructure** aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.
  * The author's comparison to **Laoshan** and the implication that **Shinan has become a more desirable area** suggest that **area quality** is a key factor in defining a region’s **""local"" status** or value.

They are criticizing the long-standing attitude where certain ""old locals"" look down on others based on where they come from or what area they represent. The author implies that this behavior is outdated and harmful, and they are questioning when this attitude might change.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - References to ""老西镇"", ""老台东"", and ""市南辛家庄"" as places with historically entrenched local identities.
  - The author mentions that ""老青岛人"" only accept certain areas (市南 > 市北 > 四方 > 李沧) as ""true"" local areas, and exclude 崂山区 and even more so areas outside the seven districts and five cities.
  - The author implies that identity is tied to birthplace, upbringing, and regional pride.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These references are used to show how the author understands and critiques the criteria used by self-proclaimed ""old locals"" to define who is ""truly local"".
  - The hierarchy and exclusion of certain areas (e.g., 崂山区, 七区五市之外) is not just a description of a phenomenon but is being used to highlight the flawed logic of defining ""local identity"" based on territorial boundaries and historical pride.
  - The author is implicitly rejecting the idea that only people from certain areas can be ""true locals"", suggesting that this is a narrow and outdated view.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is describing the **territorial-based identity** that ""old locals"" use to define themselves and exclude others.
  - The author is **not endorsing** this territorial logic but is **critiquing it**, which means we must be cautious not to annotate RL1 if it is not the author's own logic. However, the author is **explicitly describing** the criteria used by others to define ""local identity"", and in doing so, reveals how such logic functions.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is describing how certain areas (市南 > 市北 > 四方 > 李沧) are considered the ""core"" of local identity, while others are excluded. This is a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1).
  - The author is not endorsing the idea that崂山区 or areas outside 七区五市 are not ""local"", but is showing how the **current consensus** of ""local"" identity is built on **historical and emotional territorial divisions**.
  - The author is also showing how **regional pride and historical sediment** are used to justify exclusion, which is a key feature of RL1.

The core intent is to suggest that these differences (historical administrative division and dialect) affect the sense of being ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Historical administrative division (""莱西以前属于烟台"")
  * Linguistic differences (""我们这边口音都不太一样"")

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses historical administrative division and dialectal differences to highlight a perceived distinction between Laiyi and Laiyang, which implies that these are markers of local identity.
  * The author's attitude is one of observation and implicit recognition that these factors influence local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * Historical administrative division and dialect are both used to distinguish between local groups, which the author implicitly accepts as meaningful in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author references historical administrative divisions and dialects as part of the socially accepted framework for distinguishing between local groups.

即墨也曾经归属过烟台。,**," * The author states a historical fact: that Jimo (a region) was once administratively affiliated with Yantai. The statement is factual and historical in nature.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""归属过"" (was affiliated with) indicates a past administrative relationship, which is a key element in the **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** category.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is not making a claim about who is or is not a ""local person"", but is referencing the **administrative history** of a region. The statement could imply that administrative boundaries have changed, which may influence how people define ""local identity"". However, the author does not explicitly argue that this historical affiliation is used to define who is ""local"" today.
  * The statement is **neutral and descriptive**, not evaluative or argumentative.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is referencing a **past administrative affiliation**, which is a core feature of **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**. However, the author is **not using this historical fact to define current ""local identity""** or to evaluate who is or is not a local person. Therefore, it does **not meet the threshold** for annotation under the criteria of this task.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * Although the statement is about administrative boundaries, the **author does not use it to define or evaluate local identity**, nor does it serve as a standard for identifying who is or is not local.

RL2"," * The author is discussing the administrative and regional identity of a city (Pingdu), which is officially part of Qingdao. The author notes that while the city is officially called ""Pingdu City"" and is in Shandong Province, it is administratively under Qingdao. The author also points out that when people from Pingdu go outside, they identify as being from Qingdao. The core intent is to highlight how administrative affiliation influences the way people identify themselves regionally.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions the city name ""Pingdu City"", its administrative affiliation with Qingdao, and the behavior of its residents when identifying their origin to outsiders. These are potentially related to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) and RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of ""Pingdu City"" and its official status within Shandong Province is used to establish its formal identity. The administrative affiliation with Qingdao is used to explain how people from Pingdu identify themselves when outside the region. The author seems to accept this administrative logic as a legitimate basis for regional identity. The author is not resisting this logic but is instead explaining how it functions in practice.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly endorsing the use of administrative boundaries and affiliations to define regional identity. The behavior of Pingdu residents identifying as Qingdao residents when outside is a direct result of the administrative relationship. This is a clear endorsement of RL2.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using the administrative affiliation of Pingdu with Qingdao to explain how regional identity is formed and expressed. The author accepts the logic of administrative legitimacy as a valid standard for defining where someone is ""local"" or how they should identify regionally.

以前平度不在青岛范围 后来规划进去了,RL2," - The author is stating that Pingdu was not previously considered part of Qingdao but has now been included in its planning scope. This implies a shift in the definition or boundary of what constitutes the ""local"" area of Qingdao.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""以前平度不在青岛范围"" — suggests a past understanding of Qingdao's territorial boundary.
  - ""后来规划进去了"" — indicates a change in administrative or planning boundaries.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is highlighting a **change in the territorial boundary** of Qingdao, from excluding Pingdu to including it due to planning. This reflects how **administrative decisions** redefine what is considered ""local"".
  - The author's attitude is neutral but acknowledges the **importance of administrative planning in defining local scope**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The key element is the **administrative change** that altered the inclusion of Pingdu into Qingdao. This reflects how **official planning or administrative decisions** are used to define what is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is implicitly endorsing the idea that **administrative boundaries or planning decisions** determine whether a place is considered part of a local area. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the inclusion or exclusion of a place is based on legal or administrative definitions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""平度人"" (Pingdu people): a reference to people from a specific region.
  - ""归属感"" (sense of belonging): a key term for identity attachment.
  - ""潍坊"" (Weifang) and ""青岛"" (Qingdao): two cities that are being compared in terms of emotional or identity attachment.
  - The comparison between the sense of belonging to Weifang and Qingdao implies a discussion of **how people from a region (Pingdu) emotionally affiliate with different cities**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not merely stating a fact about people from Pingdu but is **implying that emotional or social belonging to a city (Weifang) can override administrative or geographic boundaries** (since Pingdu is administratively part of Qingdao).
  - The comparison between Qingdao and Weifang suggests that **the author is using the concept of emotional or social belonging as a criterion to judge who is more ""local"" to a city**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that **a person's emotional or social identification with a city (Weifang) can be stronger than their administrative or geographic identity (Qingdao)**.
  - This supports the idea that **social or emotional identity** (e.g., where one feels they belong) can be a **defining criterion for ""local identity""**.
  - The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** can override administrative boundaries in defining who is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is referencing **how people from a region (Pingdu) emotionally identify with different cities**, and how this emotional identification **can override administrative boundaries**.
  - This fits **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, as the author is **highlighting how social or emotional attachment to a city (Weifang) is used to define who is ""local"" to that city**, even if the person is administratively from another city (Qingdao).

  - The author emphasizes that they were ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) in Qingdao.
  - They mention their family's and their own growth history across different districts of Qingdao (Pingdu, Licang, Chengyang, Shibei, Lvcun).
  - They question the idea of a ""hierarchy of local people"" or ""exclusion"" between different groups in Qingdao.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The emphasis on being born and raised in Qingdao (""土生土长"") is used to establish the author's own legitimacy as a ""local.""
  - The mention of living and growing up in different districts (""从小在李沧长大"", ""父母家搬去了城阳"", etc.) is used to argue that being a ""local"" is not restricted to a single district or part of the city.
  - The questioning of the ""hierarchy"" and ""exclusion"" implies the author's belief that such criteria are not valid for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses their **own growth history and family history** in Qingdao as a basis for claiming ""local identity.""
  - They implicitly reject the idea that people from different districts should be ranked or excluded from the ""local"" identity, suggesting that the **historical rootedness of the individual** is sufficient.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author explicitly endorses **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as their identity as a ""local"" is based on being born and raised in Qingdao and having lived in multiple districts over time.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is defending their own identity and status as someone who is deeply rooted in the region, despite living in different areas for various reasons.
  - The mention of being ""土生土长"" and owning property in multiple locations is used to counter the perception of being an outsider.
  - The neighbor's comment about living in a house without heating in Jiaozhou implies a judgment about whether the author is a ""real local"" based on housing quality or living conditions.
  - The author implicitly rejects the idea that housing conditions or current residence define one’s ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly defines ""local identity"" based on being born and raised in the area (RL3).
  - The author also implies that property ownership in the region (especially in core areas like the city center) is a marker of being a ""real local"" or having deep roots (RL6).
  - The author resists the idea that current residence or housing conditions (e.g., heating) define one’s status as a local, which is part of RL5 (functional livability), but since the author **resists** this as a defining criterion, it is **not annotated**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author emphasizes that they were ""土生土长"" in the southern part of the city, which aligns with RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).

These elements are directly tied to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition) and possibly RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), as they involve dialect and the notion of originality/legitimacy of regional identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the dialect as a **criterion to distinguish between ""authentic locals"" and ""outsiders"" or ""newcomers""**. The Jimo dialect is portrayed as noble and original, while the ""new Qingdao dialect"" is seen as a diluted or hybrid form resulting from outside influence. This implies that **language and dialect are key markers of local authenticity**.
  * The author’s attitude is **positive toward the Jimo dialect** and **critical toward the new dialect**, which they see as less ""authentic"" or ""noble.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** to define who is a ""local"" or who speaks the ""authentic"" local dialect. They also imply a **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** by suggesting that certain areas (Jimo, Laoshan, etc.) are more ""original"" or ""authentic"" than others.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses the **Jimo dialect** as a **symbol of authentic local identity**, and contrasts it with a **""new"" Qingdao dialect** formed by outsiders. This reflects **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the dialect is used to determine who belongs to the ""local"" group. The emphasis on the Jimo area as the ""original"" or ""authentic"" part of Qingdao also reflects **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it implies a **long-standing, conventional boundary of what constitutes ""local.""**

**Step 6: Output Result**

我是真的被青岛大姨鄙视过啊，很严肃的告诉我，你一个外地人，又住黄岛，你跟青岛根本不沾边！我一想呢也对，我是辽宁的啊，虽然房子在黄岛，那也就只是个贵一点的物品而已，你不认为我是青岛的也没问题啊！我又不计较，我通过自己的努力在青岛工作、赚钱、安家落户、积攒了自己的生活圈子和朋友圈子，难道我需要一个渔民的后代来承认我的身份吗？不需要的，我去你青岛人开的饭店吃饭，点两个菜你还不是要规规矩矩端上来给我？除非你有骨气，不做青岛市区以外人的生意，那我没办法，我去菜市场青岛人的摊子买条鱼，你也不敢半斤说八两吧？我坐个出租车是你青岛人开的，你也不敢拒载吧？反正你不承认没关系的，认知局限又有什么办法呢？,RL6," The author is expressing frustration and defiance at being denied a ""local"" identity by a self-proclaimed local (a ""青岛大姨"") in Qingdao. They emphasize that despite being an outsider by birth, they have built a life in Qingdao through personal effort, including work, property, and social networks. The author rejects the idea that ""local identity"" should be defined by birthplace or ancestry and instead claims legitimacy through personal contribution and presence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions being from Liaoning (hukou/origin).
  - The author owns property in Huangdao, but this is framed as a ""贵一点的物品"" (just a more expensive item).
  - The author emphasizes work, earning money, and building a life and social circle in Qingdao.
  - The author questions the legitimacy of being judged by a ""fisherman’s descendant.""
  - The author references interactions with local businesses and services (restaurants, markets, taxis) to assert equal participation in the city.
  - The author rejects the claim of being ""not part of Qingdao"" and frames the other party’s view as a ""cognitive limitation.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of birthplace (""辽宁的"") is not endorsed as a valid criterion for defining ""local identity""; instead, it is used to contrast with the author's current life in Qingdao.
  - Ownership of property is acknowledged but downplayed as a material object, not a basis for identity.
  - The emphasis on personal effort (working, earning, building a life and social network) is a central argument for legitimacy in the city.
  - The author rejects the idea that ""local identity"" should be based on ancestry or birthplace.
  - The author uses equal participation in local services as a counterpoint to the idea of exclusion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **rejects** RL1 (territorial identity based on tradition or historical sediment) and RL3 (family historical rootedness).
  - The author **rejects** RL2 (administrative legitimacy via hukou) as a valid basis for identity.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** RL6 (depth of social roots and economic status) by emphasizing their social network and economic presence.
  - The author **does not endorse** RL4, RL5, or RL7 in a way that defines ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author argues that their **social integration** and **economic presence** in Qingdao—i.e., working, building a life, owning property, and forming a social network—are sufficient for being considered a legitimate part of the city. This aligns with **RL6**, as the author uses the depth of their social and economic roots as a basis for claiming ""local"" status, regardless of birthplace or ancestry.

They are resisting the idea that these cities are somehow inferior or part of a hierarchy where 青岛 is dominant. The author also expresses frustration at being labeled as part of 青岛 or its ""local identity"" when they feel they are distinct in terms of dialect, habits, and identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses historical administrative status (""跟青岛平级的"", ""市""), current administrative changes (""行政合并""), and the sense of identity and cultural distinctiveness (""口音完全不一样"", ""部分习惯也不同"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The historical and administrative status of these cities is used to **justify their independence from 青岛** and to argue against being considered as part of the same ""local identity"".
  * The author **strongly opposes** the idea that these cities should be seen as part of 青岛's ""local"" identity due to **differences in dialect and cultural habits**, which are used to **support a distinct identity**.
  * The author is **explicitly rejecting** the idea of being labeled as part of 青岛 and is **defining ""local"" in terms of historical administrative status and cultural distinctiveness**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **uses historical administrative status and cultural distinctiveness** as **criteria to define who is ""local"" or not**, and to **resist being considered part of 青岛's local identity**.
  * These are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as **valid and legitimate standards** for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author defines the boundaries of what counts as ""local"" based on historical administrative status and cultural differences, which are socially and historically rooted.
  * **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The author references the historical administrative status (""市"", ""跟青岛平级"") and recent administrative changes (""行政合并"") to define who is ""local"" or not, based on administrative legitimacy.
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: The author emphasizes dialect (""口音完全不一样"") and cultural habits (""部分习惯也不同"") as criteria to distinguish ""local"" identities and resist being grouped with 青岛 residents.

RL1, RL4"," The author is asserting a historically and culturally grounded definition of ""local identity"" tied to the traditional and unified administrative/cultural territory of Jimo (before modern administrative changes). The author emphasizes that true ""locals"" are those who belong to this historically unified Jimo region (excluding areas now separated administratively), and they define this region based on shared cultural, linguistic, and historical identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""自古以来都是即墨的地盘"" (has always been Jimo's territory) → suggests territorial identity based on historical continuity.
  - ""土著是即墨人"" (natives are Jimo people) → defines locals based on historical and cultural rootedness.
  - ""除平度莱西胶州黄岛以外的所有青岛地区"" (all Qingdao areas except Pingdu, Laixi, Jiaozhou, and Huangdao) → defines the scope of ""local"" territory.
  - ""不要说平度那个即墨"" (don't mention Pingdu's Jimo) → rejects a different historical definition of Jimo.
  - ""从隋朝开始一直到清末的大一统的即墨县"" (the unified Jimo county from Sui to Qing dynasties) → emphasizes a long-standing administrative and cultural continuity.
  - ""大一统指人文方言文化习俗统一"" (unified means unified human culture, dialect, customs) → defines ""local"" through shared cultural and linguistic traits.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses historical and cultural continuity to define the ""true"" local identity of Jimo, rejecting modern administrative divisions and alternative historical claims. The emphasis is on a shared cultural and linguistic heritage as the core of being a ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author defines ""local"" based on **historical territorial and administrative continuity** (RL1).
  - The author emphasizes **shared cultural, linguistic, and habitual traits** as defining ""local identity"" (RL4).
  - The author **rejects alternative definitions** of Jimo and defines the scope of ""local"" based on a specific historical and cultural boundary (RL1 again).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is using a **historically and culturally grounded territorial identity** to define who qualifies as a ""local Jimo person.""

RL2"," - The author is describing a situation where two roommates from different suburban areas of Qingdao (Jiaozhou and Chengyang) express mutual disdain, based on whether their respective hometowns are considered ""proper"" parts of Qingdao. The author is observing how administrative boundaries and regional status influence identity perceptions and even social relationships.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Jiaozhou and Chengyang are both suburban areas of Qingdao, but their administrative status is different.
  - The Chengyang roommate claims Jiaozhou is not ""real Qingdao"" because it was not designated as a district.
  - The Jiaozhou roommate counters by pointing out that other areas (Jinan and Jimo) were later designated as districts.
  - The Chengyang roommate prefers a boyfriend from more prestigious districts (Shinan, Shibei), and rejects a relationship with a boy from Huangdao due to its administrative status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The administrative status of a place (whether it is designated as a district) is being used as a marker of legitimacy in defining who is a ""true local.""
  - The author notes how this administrative distinction affects social dynamics, such as romantic preferences.
  - The author is implicitly showing that the **author's roommates** use **administrative boundaries** as a key criterion to judge who is ""truly local"" and who is not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The key RL element is the **administrative legitimacy** of a region as a marker of ""local identity.""
  - The author does not explicitly oppose this logic and is describing it as a **socially accepted standard** among the roommates.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author observes that the roommates use **administrative designation (e.g., being ""划为区"")** as a standard to judge the legitimacy of a region as part of Qingdao and by extension, the identity of its residents.
  - This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the administrative status is used to define who is considered ""local.""

我老公认识我的时候，说他是黄岛的，拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系～很长一段时间我单纯的以为黄岛是一个单独的地方，跟青岛没关～,RL1," * The author is recounting a personal experience in which her husband insisted on identifying as ""from Huangdao"" and rejected any connection to Qingdao. The author initially believed Huangdao was a completely separate place from Qingdao. The core intent is to reflect on how people identify with local regions and how such identities can be emotionally or culturally distinct.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses the husband's refusal to acknowledge a connection between Huangdao and Qingdao, suggesting that he sees them as distinct.
  * The author's own belief that Huangdao was a separate place implies a shared or accepted regional identity boundary.
  * The husband's insistence on a distinct identity may reflect a long-standing social or emotional attachment to a specific area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The husband's refusal to acknowledge Qingdao as part of his identity supports the idea that **people can define their local identity based on long-standing regional divisions**.
  * The author's belief that Huangdao is a separate place from Qingdao reflects **socially conventional territorial identity**, where people emotionally or historically distinguish between areas.
  * The author is not resisting or negating this logic, but rather acknowledging it as a shared perception.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author endorses the idea that people can have a strong emotional or social identification with a specific area, even when it is administratively part of a larger region.
  * The husband's behavior and the author's belief both imply that **regional identity is often based on historical, emotional, or socially accepted boundaries**, not just administrative ones.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's narrative supports **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it shows how people (including the author) can define and emotionally separate ""local"" areas based on long-standing social perceptions, even if those areas are administratively connected.

RL2"," - The author is criticizing the tendency of some ""city residents"" to refer to Weifang Airport as if it were naturally associated with Weifang city itself, while implying that the speaker is defending Jiaodong Airport and questioning the legitimacy of those who claim Weifang Airport as their own. The author seems to challenge the idea that just because a city built an airport, it can claim the airport as part of its identity or territory.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""市区的动不动的就潍坊机场"" — implies that some city residents identify with or claim Weifang Airport as part of their ""local"" identity.
  - ""给潍坊建的机场 怎么的"" — implies that the airport was built for Weifang, and is thus associated with the city.
  - ""合着胶州被你们划到潍坊去了呗？"" — implies a territorial dispute or confusion, questioning whether Jiaozhou is being considered part of Weifang.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the airport as a symbol of **administrative and territorial identity**. By questioning whether Jiaozhou is being ""included"" in Weifang, the author is **challenging the legitimacy of territorial claims** and **implying that identity should be based on actual administrative boundaries**.
  - The author resists the idea that just because a city built an airport, it automatically becomes part of the city's identity or territory.
  - The author is **implicitly defending the idea that administrative boundaries define ""local"" identity**, and **resisting the notion that construction or investment alone can confer ""local"" status**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the standard for defining ""local"" identity.
  - The author **implicitly resists** other potential criteria, such as **geographical proximity or economic investment**, as valid for defining who is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that the **administrative affiliation of a place or person** (e.g., whether Jiaozhou is part of Weifang) should determine whether it can be considered ""local"", rather than the **geographical proximity or construction efforts** of a city.

The author attributes this to historical and geographic differences in development between districts, particularly the contrast between more developed urban areas (市南市北) and rural or less-developed ones (李沧黄岛). The author implies that this historical development shaped how people today judge who is or is not a ""real local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions:
    - ""老一辈那"" (the older generation)
    - ""青岛交通不发达"" (Qingdao's underdeveloped transportation)
    - ""市南市北住人多"" (Shinan and Shibei districts had more residents)
    - ""李沧黄岛是农村种地多"" (Licang and Huangdao were rural with more farming)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using historical urban development and settlement patterns to explain the formation of a social hierarchy in local identity. The older generation's perception of which areas were ""urban"" and ""civilized"" (市南市北) versus ""rural"" and ""less developed"" (李沧黄岛) is used to justify the current local identity distinctions.
  * The author is not opposing this logic but is instead explaining its origin, implying that it is a widely accepted or historically grounded way of thinking.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **historical settlement patterns and urban development** as the basis for how the older generation defines ""local identity"".
  * This is a **territorial identity** based on **long-accumulated social habits and historical sediment**, and is used to distinguish between areas that ""count"" as local and those that don't.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is referencing **historical and socially conventional territorial divisions** to explain how local identity is defined. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

This is presented as a personal recollection and a reflection on how language and common usage can create ambiguous or incorrect geographic associations without any intention of discrimination.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses how they once considered certain areas not part of Qingdao.
  - They reference historical or conventional regional labels (e.g., Pingdu is not Qingdao, Shouguang is not Weifang).
  - The author notes that this is not about discrimination but rather a result of how people commonly speak about regions.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses these examples to illustrate how **regional identity is influenced by long-standing social conventions and language use**.
  - The focus is on **how people in daily life draw boundaries and assign regional identities based on conventional usage**, not legal or administrative criteria.
  - The author is **not endorsing or resisting these criteria**, but is **reflecting on how they were once part of their own cognitive framework** for defining ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly conveys** that **regional identity can be shaped by conventional, socially accepted language and mental maps**, which aligns with **RL1**.
  - There is **no indication** that the author endorses administrative, historical rootedness, linguistic, economic, or occupational criteria in this context.
  - The author **does not express any criteria that they resist or reject** in this text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author reflects on how **socially conventional territorial identity** shaped their understanding of what counts as ""local"" in the past, based on **common usage and social habits**.
  - The key phrase is ""日常用语会造成的模糊"", indicating that **language and social conventions can shape identity boundaries**.
  - This matches **RL1**, as it reflects how **regional identity is defined and perceived through socially conventional territorial cognition**.

The author notes that these cues convey a **sense of local identity and subtle regional hierarchy**, including a **""main urban area superiority""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * - Mention of ""Cangkou"" as a specific area
  * - Use of ""Qingdao dialect"" and accent as a marker
  * - Questions about ""which district one is from"" (e.g., Chengyang)
  * - Implied regional hierarchy or ""main urban area superiority""
  * - The author's status as a non-local is mentioned
  * - Subtle regional differentiation in speech and attitude

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **not defining ""local identity"" explicitly**, but they are **observing how locals define or express it implicitly** through:
    * **Geographical references** (e.g., Cangkou, Chengyang)
    * **Dialect and accent** as identity markers
    * **Questions about one's origin** within the city
    * **Subtle expressions of regional superiority**
  * These elements are **used by locals to distinguish between ""us"" and ""them""**, even if it's not overt discrimination.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not explicitly endorse** the criteria used by locals to define ""local identity"", but they **observe and describe** the **implicit logic** used by locals to **form and express identity boundaries**.
  * These include **geographical references**, **linguistic markers**, and **regional self-positioning**, all of which are **used by locals to define or signal ""local"" identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The observed **geographical references (Cangkou, Chengyang)** and **questions about one's origin** align with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they reflect how locals **define and distinguish areas** and **use them to construct identity boundaries**.
  * The **use of dialect and accent** as identity markers aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it is a **linguistic cue used to signal ""local"" identity**.
  * The **subtle expressions of regional superiority** (e.g., ""main urban area superiority"") suggest **RL1** again, as they reflect **socially accepted or internalized territorial hierarchies**.

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。",N/A," The author is analyzing the social phenomenon in Qingdao where the core urban area (mainly the old urban districts like Shinan) often excludes people from other districts (e.g., Chengyang, Huangdao, etc.) from being considered ""true Qingdao people."" The author is critical of this exclusion and the underlying social dynamics, including educational inequality, linguistic and cultural differences, and economic disparities. The author is not merely describing the phenomenon but is offering a **clear critique of the criteria used to define who is considered a ""local"" in Qingdao**, and is **explicitly rejecting the legitimacy of such criteria**. However, the task is to identify the **criteria that the author themselves endorse or implicitly convey** for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text includes:
  - Administrative boundaries and educational system (RL2, RL3)
  - Linguistic and cultural differences (RL4)
  - Transportation and economic factors (RL5, RL6)
  - Educational access and social hierarchy (RL3, RL6)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that administrative boundaries or educational access should define who is a ""Qingdao person"", but **implicitly acknowledges** that these are criteria used by the ""main city"" group.
  - The author **acknowledges** that **language and cultural differences** are used to construct a ""local"" identity, but frames this as a **basis for discrimination**.
  - The author **mentions** **transportation barriers** and **economic disparities**, but again, this is framed as **evidence of exclusionary practices**, not as a basis for defining who is a ""local"".
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse** any of the criteria as valid for defining ""local identity"", but **acknowledges their role in the social construction of identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse** any of the RL criteria as valid for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **does not implicitly convey** any criteria that are used to define ""local identity"" in a way that is **endorsed or used by the author themselves**.
  - The author **critiques** the criteria used by the ""main city"" group and **does not present any alternative criteria**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria.
  - The author **does not present any alternative** criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **describes the criteria used by others** and **critiques them**, but **does not use them or present them as valid**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
Output:"
你这种海归硕士去市南或者地铁溜一圈一大推大姨让你娶她曼很喜欢你这种高学历的,"**
None"," * The author is expressing a humorous or sarcastic observation about a stereotype: that highly educated foreign returnees (海归) are perceived by some local women (大姨) as desirable marriage prospects in a specific urban area (市南), possibly implying that such perceptions are common or exaggerated.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text refers to ""市南"" (a specific geographic area in Qingdao), implying a local context.
  * The phrase ""让你娶她"" suggests a social interaction or relationship dynamic.
  * The reference to ""海归硕士"" (overseas returnee with a master's degree) implies a contrast between educational background and local identity.
  * The use of ""大姨"" (a colloquial term for middle-aged women, often used with a tone of familiarity or teasing) implies a social group associated with the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""市南"" is used to define a specific area where this phenomenon occurs, which could be seen as part of a local identity context.
  * The interaction described (""让你娶她"") is not directly about defining ""local identity"", but the social group (""大姨"") and the location (""市南"") may imply that the speaker sees the behavior as part of a local social pattern.
  * The mention of ""海归硕士"" suggests that the speaker is contrasting their own educational background with the expectations or behaviors of local people, which may imply a subtle commentary on how ""local"" and ""non-local"" identities are socially constructed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The use of ""市南"" could be interpreted as an implicit reference to a local area, but the author does not clearly define what makes someone ""local"" or what criteria are used to judge that.
  * The social dynamic described does not establish a clear standard for ""local identity"" as per the RL framework.
  * The phrase ""大姨"" could imply a local social group, but again, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this to define ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The reference to ""市南"" could be interpreted as a territorial identity (RL1), but the author does not clearly define what makes someone a ""local"" based on this.
  * The use of ""大姨"" could imply a cultural or social group, but again, it is not clearly used as a criterion for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * No RL category is clearly and directly used by the author to define ""local identity"" in this text.

我是李村的，感觉可能很多人对青岛有争论可能是对“青岛”这个所谓的概念站在不同角度去理解的。仅从个人的认识来说，如果说是市的层面，我的观念感觉城阳即墨胶州西海岸都可以说是青岛，平度莱西确实是有点太远了，总感觉名义上的，我确实对那边缺少同在一个青岛的归属感。如果说是岛的层面，那我认为红岛和黄岛肯定不属于青岛，这三个应该是并列的，青岛的话我认为城阳的流亭以南，加上市内四区的范围都叫青岛。,"**
RL1"," * The author is discussing how the concept of ""Qingdao"" is perceived differently depending on the perspective, and is expressing their own view on what geographic areas can be considered part of ""Qingdao"" from both a city-level and island-level perspective. The author is defining the boundaries of ""local"" in Qingdao by distinguishing between areas that feel like part of the city and those that do not, based on a sense of belonging and conventional regional cognition.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses the city-level and island-level definitions of Qingdao.
  * Mentions specific areas: Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, Xihai'an, Pingdu, Laixi, Huangdao, Hongdao.
  * Indicates a sense of belonging or lack thereof in certain areas.
  * Uses phrases like “名义上的” (nominal), “归属感” (sense of belonging), and “并列的” (parallel, not part of the same group).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **regional cognitive boundaries** and **psychological sense of belonging** to define what counts as ""Qingdao"" and who might feel like ""local"" people in the city.
  * The distinction between ""city-level"" and ""island-level"" Qingdao reflects a **conventional territorial identity**, based on long-standing social and emotional perceptions.
  * The author is **excluding** certain areas from the ""local"" identity due to **lack of emotional or social connection**, implying that these areas are not truly part of the local identity system.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **explicitly defining the boundaries of the ""local"" identity** of Qingdao based on **regional scope** and **psychological belonging**, not administrative or legal criteria.
  * The criteria involve **conventional regional cognition** and **emotional connection**, which are used to distinguish between areas that are ""truly Qingdao"" and those that are only ""nominal.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's argument is centered on **how different areas are perceived as part of Qingdao**, based on **long-accumulated social habits, emotional connection, and conventional territorial identity**.
  * This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is defining what counts as the ""core"" or ""true"" Qingdao based on **historical and emotional boundaries**, and **mental maps** of what constitutes a ""local"" area.

**Output:**
RL1"
完蛋，我们都是郊区人,RL1," * The author is expressing a sense of shared identity or affiliation with others from the suburbs, using the phrase “我们都是郊区人” (We are all people from the suburbs). This implies a shared regional identity or social group identity based on geographic origin.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “郊区人” (people from the suburbs), which suggests a geographic-based identity. This could relate to RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) or RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), depending on the context.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase “我们都是郊区人” is used to emphasize a shared identity based on geographic origin — the suburbs. The author is likely implying that being from the suburbs is a defining characteristic that unites them with others in the same group. There is no mention of administrative status, cultural traits, or economic roots, but the emphasis on shared geographic origin is clear.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using geographic origin as a basis for identity. This is consistent with RL1, as it involves a shared regional cognition or mental map of identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""我们都是郊区人"" aligns with RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity. The author is defining ""local identity"" or a sense of belonging based on being from the suburbs, which is a form of regional cognition and group identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * Output: RL1"

RL5"," * The author is expressing that the issue is not limited to transportation, but also includes other essential urban services and amenities such as healthcare, education, and shopping. This implies a broader critique of the livability and functional quality of a place.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""medical care"", ""education"", and ""shopping"", which are all related to the functional quality of a place.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are being used to indicate that the area being discussed lacks essential urban amenities. This contributes to an implicit evaluation of the area's quality as a place to live.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using the lack of these services as a way to judge the quality of the area as a ""good local"" place to live. This is not explicitly tied to defining ""local identity"" in terms of people, but rather to the quality of the local area itself.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is implicitly using the lack of healthcare, education, and shopping as a standard to evaluate the livability of a local area. This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author is judging the quality of the local environment based on its functional livability.

RL1, RL4"," - The author is making a humorous or mocking comment about people who live inside the city walls (""城墙里头"") and refer to themselves as ""天龙人"". The author implies that these people look down on others and considers outsiders to be ""乡下人"" (rural or country people). The author is suggesting a social hierarchy or distinction between ""city people"" and ""country people"", and is likely criticizing or mocking the attitude of the ""city people"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""住城墙里头"" (living inside the city walls): may relate to **RL1** (territorial identity).
  - ""天龙人"" (a label for a group of people): potentially a **symbolic identity label**.
  - ""讲话都这么吊了"" (speaking in a condescending or arrogant manner): may imply **social segregation** or **cultural identity**.
  - ""其他都是乡下人"" (others are all country people): suggests a **territorial and cultural-based distinction** between groups.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""住城墙里头"" is used to define a **core area** of identity, which is a key part of **RL1**.
  - ""天龙人"" is a **symbolic label** for people who are considered ""local"" or superior, and the author is mocking this label, but still **implicitly accepts it as a real identity marker**.
  - The author implies that the way these people speak (""讲话都这么吊了"") is part of their **cultural or social identity**, which is part of **RL4**.
  - ""乡下人"" is used to contrast and define the **non-local** or **outsider** group, which is part of **RL1** and **RL4**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses the idea of living in a specific area (""城墙里头"") to define a group of ""local"" people**, which is **RL1**.
  - The author **uses the label ""天龙人"" and the behavior of those people to define a cultural identity** that distinguishes them from others, which is **RL4**.
  - The author **does not reject the idea that these people consider themselves superior or different**, and the **mocking tone implies the author is aware of and using the cultural logic of the group**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **uses the concept of living in a specific area (""城墙里头"") to define a group of ""local"" people**, which aligns with **RL1**.
  - The author **uses cultural and behavioral differences (arrogant speech, labeling as ""天龙人"" vs. ""乡下人"") to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" groups**, which aligns with **RL4**.

The key intent is to convey how the perception of these areas as ""local"" or ""non-core"" has changed over time, especially in the context of urbanization and administrative reorganization.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text references **administrative divisions** (老下关、秦淮区、雨花、建邺), and mentions **historical rural characteristics** (农田, 2000年以前), implying a contrast between the past and present status of these areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **administrative boundaries** to situate the historical status of these areas. They are also implying that these areas were once considered peripheral or rural, suggesting that **administrative definitions** and **historical land use** (rural vs. urban) play a role in how people perceive them as part of the ""local"" identity or not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses **administrative divisions** to define the historical status of these areas, which contributes to the perception of whether they are ""local"" or not. The mention of **rural characteristics (农田)** in the past also reflects a historical contrast, but it is **not used as a direct criterion** for defining ""local identity"" in the current sense.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The use of **historical administrative divisions** aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author references the **administrative definitions** of the past to explain the status of these areas. The author is implying that these areas were once considered on the margins of the city, and that this was based on **administrative definitions**.
  * The mention of **农田** (farmland) reflects a **historical rural status**, but it is **not used as a current or defining criterion** for local identity, so it does not qualify under RL5 or any other category.

The author is critical of using the old boundary as the standard, arguing that it would make Nanjing smaller than a small county. The author **implicitly endorses the modern administrative boundary** as the more legitimate or practical standard for defining the ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **Historical city wall boundary** as a standard for defining the ""local"" area.
  - **Administrative boundary** as a modern standard.
  - **Comparison between old and new standards** in terms of area size and legitimacy.
  - **Evaluation of the size and scope of the ""local"" area** based on these standards.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **historical city wall** is presented as a **past standard** that the author **implicitly resists**, as using it would reduce Nanjing to a small county.
  - The **administrative boundary** is presented as the **current and accepted standard**, and the author **supports its use** as a more accurate and comprehensive definition of the local area.
  - The **comparison and evaluation** serve to **justify the author's implicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining ""local identity"" or the scope of the ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses administrative boundaries** as the legitimate standard for defining the local area.
  - The author **rejects the historical territorial identity** as outdated and insufficient.
  - The **focus is on defining the scope of the ""local"" area**, which is relevant to how ""local people"" are understood in relation to that area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **implicitly endorses administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the standard for defining the scope of the ""local"" area.
  - The author **implicitly resists the socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** as an outdated and inadequate standard.
  - The author's **core argument is about the legitimacy and practicality of the current administrative boundary** in defining the local area, which is directly tied to the definition of ""local people"" in the context of Nanjing.

城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,"RL1, RL3"," - The author is recalling their childhood and describing a sense of boundary between where they lived and the city center (""夫子庙""), indicating a distinction between ""outside the city wall"" and ""inside the city wall."" The phrase ""去夫子庙都说进城了"" implies that crossing into the city center is a meaningful act, suggesting a cognitive or emotional boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" or ""core local"" and ""peripheral.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""城墙外"" (outside the city wall): implies a spatial boundary.
  - ""我小时候住那边"" (I used to live there as a child): relates to personal growth history and early settlement.
  - ""去夫子庙都说进城了"" (going to Fuzimiao is considered going into the city): suggests a socially conventional territorial identity with symbolic meaning.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""城墙外"" and ""进城了"" imply a **socially recognized boundary** between ""outside the city wall"" and ""inside the city wall,"" indicating a **symbolic territorial identity**.
  - ""我小时候住那边"" implies that the author has a **personal history of settlement** in the area, which contributes to a sense of belonging.
  - The overall statement reflects a **mental map** of what counts as ""the city"" and the **emotional or cognitive boundary** between the periphery and the core.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly assumes that the city wall and the act of entering the city center are **socially conventional markers** of ""local"" identity.
  - The author also implies that **personal settlement history** (growing up in a certain area) is part of their identity and contributes to a sense of being ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The boundary between ""outside the city wall"" and ""inside the city wall"" aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a shared or historically sedimented understanding of what constitutes the ""core"" of the local area.
  - The mention of ""我小时候住那边"" aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it reflects the author's own early settlement and growth in the area, which is used to situate their identity in relation to the local.

RL1"," - The author is reflecting on how people's perception of the ""main urban area"" has changed over time, particularly in relation to transportation development. The author implies that in the past, due to poor transportation, people considered areas within the city wall (e.g., Baixia District) as the real city center, while areas like Xaguanshu District were seen as distant or less central.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""城墙内才是主城区"" (the area within the city wall is the real main urban area) → relates to **RL1** (territorial identity based on historical and social cognition).
  - ""白下区的同学就很少去下关区"" (students from Baixia rarely went to Xaguanshu) → implies **social segregation** and **regional identity differences**, also pointing to **RL1**.
  - ""因为远"" (because it was far) → suggests **geographical distance** as a factor influencing identity perception, still relevant to **RL1**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the idea of the city wall and the limited movement of people due to poor transportation to illustrate how **historical and social territorial cognition** shaped the perception of who is ""local"" and what constitutes the core area.
  - The reference to ""Baixia"" and ""Xaguanshu"" as distinct areas with different levels of centrality implies a **socially constructed boundary** of ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is clearly using **historical and socially conventional territorial cognition** to define what was considered the ""real"" local area in the past.
  - The author implies that the **city wall** and **historical centrality** played a key role in how people identified themselves as ""local"" and how they perceived other areas.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's core argument is that in the past, due to poor transportation, people had a **clear mental map** of what was ""local"" and what was not, based on **historical and social territorial boundaries**. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

The core intent is to convey how the perception of spatial distance and accessibility has changed over time.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions living in a specific area (""城南 now Wanjia City""), and references ""瑞金路解放门"" (Ruijin Road and Jiefang Gate), which are geographical landmarks. The discussion of perceived distance and transportation conditions implies a sense of local identity rooted in personal history and spatial cognition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses their **childhood residence** and the **perceived distance to landmarks** to express a **sense of local identity shaped by personal growth history and spatial cognition**. The reference to the past transportation conditions is used to emphasize how the **local area has changed**, but also how the **author's identity is tied to their early experiences in the region**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using their **childhood residence and spatial memory** as a basis for their sense of local identity. The reference to distance and transportation is **not about evaluating the quality of the area**, but rather about how **growing up in a certain place shaped their perception of what counts as ""local.""**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is **explicitly referencing their personal growth history and childhood residence** to express a **sense of local identity**. This fits **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**. The author is not using administrative boundaries, language, or economic status to define local identity, but rather their **own early life experiences in the southern part of the city**.

nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,RL1," * The author is expressing that ""Jianye"" is a rural or peripheral area, and that one must cross a river and bridge to enter the urban or central part of the city. This implies a contrast between the ""local"" rural area (Jianye) and the more central or urban area, and suggests a boundary between them.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""建邺是乡下"" (Jianye is the countryside) — implies a regional identity and boundary between ""local"" and ""urban"".
  * ""进城要过河过桥进城墙的"" (to enter the city, you have to cross a river and bridge into the city wall) — suggests a symbolic or actual boundary between ""local"" and ""urban"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""建邺是乡下"" positions Jianye as a non-urban or peripheral area, which implies a contrast between ""local"" and ""urban"" identities.
  * The description of crossing a river and bridge to enter the city wall suggests a **mental or physical boundary** between ""local"" (Jianye) and the ""urban center"", which supports the idea of a **territorially defined local identity**.
  * The author is using this spatial logic to define who or what is ""local"" — Jianye is not considered part of the ""city proper"", and thus its residents may not be seen as ""urban locals"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using a **territorial logic** to distinguish Jianye as a ""countryside"" area that is not part of the ""city proper"".
  * The **boundary** (crossing a river and bridge to enter the city wall) is used to define who or what is ""local"" in the author's view.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using a **territorial logic** to define the boundary between ""local"" (Jianye) and the ""urban center"", implying that Jianye is not part of the ""true"" local area.
  * This matches **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is referencing a **mental map or social perception** of what counts as the ""local"" area versus the ""countryside"".

**Step 6: Output Result**

The statement implies that the city wall was a **cognitive marker** of what counted as ""local"" versus ""non-local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The **city wall** is mentioned as a **boundary marker**.
  * The **family's regional cognition** is described as being based on this boundary.
  * The **distinction between the city and the suburbs** is emphasized.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The city wall is used as a **mental boundary** to define what is considered part of the local area and what is not.
  * The author implies that this boundary is **rooted in long-standing social and emotional perceptions**, which are **shared by the family** and possibly the broader community.
  * The author is **affirming** this kind of boundary logic, not resisting it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using a **long-standing, socially conventional boundary (the city wall)** to define the **local area** and distinguish it from the suburbs.
  * This aligns with the idea of **socially constructed regional cognition** used to define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's statement reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**, where the city wall is a **symbolic and historically accepted boundary** for defining the local area.
  * This matches **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

They argue that such a sense of superiority (优越感) stems from historical or cultural ""depth"" (底蕴), not financial status. They also question the relevance of mentioning ""Shanghai people"" (海人), implying that it is not a valid or relevant criterion for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions:
    - ""主城区"" (main urban area), which could imply a territorial or administrative boundary.
    - ""历史沿革"" (historical evolution), which suggests a socially conventional or historical understanding of the area.
    - ""优越感来自于底蕴"" (a sense of superiority comes from depth/cultural heritage), which implies a socially conventional or cultural-based identity.
    - ""有底蕴不等于有钱"" (having cultural depth doesn't mean being wealthy), which contrasts cultural identity with economic status.
    - ""扯上海人做什么"" (why bring up Shanghai people?), which questions the relevance of a specific group to the definition of ""local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **rejecting** the idea that economic wealth or being a ""Shanghai person"" are valid criteria for defining ""local identity.""
  * They **endorse** the idea that the ""main urban area"" is defined by **historical and cultural depth**, not by economic or social status.
  * The phrase ""优越感来自于底蕴"" supports the idea that **cultural and historical legitimacy** is used to form a sense of local identity.

  * The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **historical and cultural depth** is a valid basis for defining ""local identity"" (RL1).
  * The author **resists** the idea that economic status (wealth) or being a ""Shanghai person"" (possibly referring to migrants or a specific subgroup) is a valid basis for local identity — these should be **excluded**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that the **historical and cultural depth** of the ""main urban area"" is the legitimate basis for defining who or what is ""local,"" and that this is **not tied to wealth**. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is defending a **long-standing, socially accepted understanding of the area** as the core of ""local identity.""

肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心,** RL1," * The author is expressing a positive view of the convenience of Xianlin and humorously asserting its importance by calling it ""the center of the universe."" This reflects a strong sense of pride or identification with Xianlin.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""Xianlin is the center of the universe"" implies a high status and centrality of the area, potentially indicating a regional identity or social recognition of the area as a core or important place.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase functions to express the author's positive perception and emotional attachment to Xianlin. It implies that Xianlin is a central and important place, which may serve as a basis for identifying with the local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is endorsing the idea that Xianlin is central or important, which could be a socially conventional way of defining the local area and its identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is implying that Xianlin is a core area, which aligns with RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity.

**Output:** RL1"
什么时候方言成为决定是否是主城区的标准了？,RL1," *   The author is questioning and expressing skepticism about a **standard**—specifically, the use of **dialect**—being used to **determine whether a place is part of the main urban area**. The author is **challenging** the legitimacy of this standard, implying that it should not be the basis for defining the core area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key element here is **""dialect""**, which is a **language/cultural marker** often used to distinguish locals from outsiders.
  *   The phrase **""decide whether is the main urban area""** suggests the author is questioning a **definition of ""local area""** based on this linguistic criterion.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **dialect** is being used **as a criterion** to determine whether a place is part of the main urban area, which is a **territorial identity** issue.
  *   The author is **challenging** this logic, suggesting that it is **not a legitimate or conventional standard** for defining the core area.
  *   The **author is not endorsing dialect as a standard** but is **pointing out its misuse or questionable legitimacy**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not endorsing** the use of dialect to define the main urban area.
  *   However, the **author is implicitly acknowledging** that **dialect is being used as a territorial identity marker**, which is a key element of **RL1**.
  *   The author is **critiquing the misuse of this criterion**, but the **existence of the logic itself is still part of the symbolic ranking logic** being discussed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is **questioning the legitimacy of using dialect** as a **territorial identity marker** to define the core urban area.
  *   This **reflects a challenge to the conventional social logic** (RL1) that uses **cultural-linguistic traits** to define local identity and regional boundaries.
  *   Therefore, the **RL1** category is relevant here, as it concerns **socially conventional territorial identity** and **mental maps**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,RL2," - The author is challenging the idea of using administrative boundaries to define ""local identity"" or the scope of a ""local"" area. They argue that although Qixia is administratively part of the urban core, its de facto local identity stretches beyond the official boundary into Jurong. The author implies that administrative divisions are not a valid or relevant standard for defining who is a ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""行政上栖霞也是主城区"" – mentions administrative status.
  - ""栖霞的边缘都到句容了"" – implies that the de facto local scope goes beyond administrative boundaries.
  - ""你能按行政区域划分？"" – questions the validity of administrative boundaries as a criterion.
  - ""本地人从来不看这个"" – indicates that locals do not use administrative divisions to define themselves.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the mismatch between administrative boundaries and actual local identity to **reject administrative legitimacy** as a valid criterion for defining who is a ""local"".
  - The phrase ""本地人从来不看这个"" shows the author's **explicit dismissal** of administrative criteria in favor of **real-world local identity**.
  - The author's core argument is that **administrative definitions do not align with the actual social and cultural understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly resists** the use of administrative legitimacy to define local identity.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** a more **socially conventional or culturally grounded** understanding of local identity (though not fully elaborated in this short text).
  - The key RL category being **rejected** is RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **explicitly rejecting RL2** as a valid standard for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **does not endorse any specific RL category** in this text beyond the rejection of RL2.
  - The phrase ""本地人从来不看这个"" indicates that the author believes **local people do not rely on administrative legitimacy** to define their identity.

The author implies that the old city is still the core and is well-developed, while the new areas lack visibility and recognition among outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mentions of old city (老城), new urban areas (江北, 河西), and the contrast between them.
  * Reference to ""外地人"" (outsiders) and their unfamiliarity with new areas.
  * Evaluation of urban image and recognition (城市界面), and the idea that certain areas are not well known or appealing to outsiders.
  * No direct reference to identity, but the author is evaluating which areas are considered ""local"" in terms of cultural or functional recognition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The contrast between the old city and new areas is used to highlight which parts of Nanjing are seen as ""local"" or representative by outsiders.
  * The author implies that the old city is the real ""local"" area, as it is central, well-known, and has better urban image.
  * The author is implicitly using the **recognition and familiarity of an area among outsiders** as a standard to evaluate its ""local value"" or status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using the **recognition and image of an area** to define its ""local"" status or value.
  * The author does not mention administrative boundaries, language, historical family roots, or economic status as defining criteria.
  * The focus is on **how the area is perceived by outsiders**, which relates to **functional livability and environmental quality**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implicitly evaluates the ""local value"" of an area based on **how it is perceived and recognized by outsiders**, including its **urban image and functional livability**.
  * This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author uses **urban interface (城市界面)** and **recognition by outsiders** as indicators of whether an area is a ""good"" or ""true"" local area.

**Step 6: Output Result**

The statement is primarily descriptive and does not express any criteria for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * No explicit or implicit criteria for defining ""local people"" or ""local areas"" are present in the sentence. The text is a factual observation or aesthetic remark.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The sentence lacks any evaluative or definitional language related to ""local identity."" It does not imply any criteria for judging who is a local or what constitutes a local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * No RL elements are present or relevant to the definition of ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The text is a visual or geographical observation and does not imply or express any logic for defining or evaluating ""local identity.""

**Output:**"
高楼大厦就叫城建了？交通,**," * The author appears to be questioning or challenging the idea that ""tall buildings"" are sufficient to define urban construction (""城建""). They also mention ""transportation"", which may imply that they consider transportation as an important factor in evaluating urban construction or a ""local"" area's quality. However, the sentence is incomplete, so the full intent is ambiguous.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""高楼大厦"" (tall buildings) could be associated with perceptions of urban development, but it is not clearly linked to defining ""local identity"".
  * The mention of ""交通"" (transportation) could relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), but again, the connection to ""local identity"" is not made explicit.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author may be critiquing the idea that tall buildings alone define urban quality or development, but this is speculative.
  * The reference to transportation might suggest a value placed on functional livability, but it is not clearly used as a criterion for defining who is a ""local"" or what makes an area ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The text does not clearly establish any RL criteria that the author uses to define ""local identity"".
  * The author may be critiquing urban development standards, but this does not equate to defining ""local identity"" in the way required by the task.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * No RL category is clearly supported by the text as a criterion for defining ""local identity"".
  * The author's intent is not clearly focused on defining ""local identity"", and the elements mentioned are more about urban development or personal opinion rather than identity criteria.

**Output:**"
哈哈哈有口音哥还行,"**
RL4"," - The author is reacting to someone with a local accent in a positive tone (""还行"", meaning ""not bad"" or ""okay""), possibly acknowledging the speaker's local identity through their accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""有口音"" (has an accent) is a key phrase that may relate to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""有口音"" is used to refer to a person's linguistic or cultural background, and the positive reaction (""哈哈哈有口音哥还行"") suggests that the author views this accent as a marker of local identity or authenticity.
  - The author is not resisting or negating the idea of using accent as a marker of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The use of accent as a marker of local identity is endorsed or implicitly conveyed by the author.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The phrase ""有口音"" is directly related to RL4, which focuses on language, accent, and cultural habits as criteria for identifying ""local people"".
  - The author's positive reaction implies recognition of the speaker's local identity through their accent.

**Output:**

我基本就是在海淀朝阳丰台活动，比较宅，从我家去公司也是走四环或者三环,"**
None"," * The author is describing their personal living and working habits, mentioning the areas they frequently visit and the routes they take. There is **no explicit or implicit claim or argument about what constitutes a ""local person"" or how to define a ""local area""**. The focus is on personal behavior and routine, not on identity definitions or evaluations of regional belonging.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions specific areas (海淀, 朝阳, 丰台), as well as roads (四环, 三环), which could potentially relate to **RL1** if they were used to define a ""local"" identity or regional boundary. However, the author is simply stating where they go and how they travel, not using these to establish identity criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mentioned areas and roads serve as **background information** about the author's lifestyle and routine. They are **not used to define or evaluate who is a ""local""** or to judge the quality or scope of a local area. The author does not express any attitude or judgment about these areas in the context of identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * No RL elements are **used to define ""local identity""** or **evaluate local areas** in a way that is endorsed by the author. The text does not present any criteria for determining who is local or what constitutes a local area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

礼贤拆迁户,"**
RL3"," * The phrase ""礼贤拆迁户"" (Lixian relocation households) is a reference to a specific group of people who were relocated due to urban redevelopment in the Lixian area. This term implicitly carries a social categorization that differentiates these individuals from others in the region, especially in terms of identity and historical rootedness.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The term ""拆迁户"" (relocation households) implies a disruption of long-term residence or ownership in a place.
  * The term ""礼贤"" (Lixian) refers to a specific geographic and cultural area.
  * Together, the phrase may imply a distinction between those who were displaced and those who remained or were historically rooted in the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase may be used to categorize a group of people who were not ""rooted"" in the area before the relocation.
  * It may implicitly suggest that these individuals are not considered ""true locals"" due to their displacement.
  * The author may be drawing a contrast between those who were relocated and those who have long-term ties to the area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The phrase implies a contrast between those who were historically rooted and those who were displaced.
  * The author may be endorsing the idea that historical rootedness is a key criterion for being considered a ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""礼贤拆迁户"" implies a distinction between people based on their historical ties to the area.
  * This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author may be implicitly suggesting that being a ""true local"" is tied to long-term presence in the area, not just recent relocation.

The author implies that the lack of metro access and the inconvenience of relying solely on buses and bicycles makes the area less desirable or ""less local"" in terms of livability and modernity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""Micyun Reservoir"", ""memorials"", and the lack of metro access, which may relate to RL1 (territorial identity) and RL5 (livability).
  * The focus on transportation (bus vs. metro) and the inconvenience of travel may relate to RL5.
  * The author implies that areas with metro access are more modern or desirable, possibly indicating a shift in what counts as a ""good local"" area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is contrasting the current location (which has only buses) with Beijing (which has a metro), implying that metro access is a marker of modernity and convenience.
  * The lack of metro access is used to justify the area's inconvenience, suggesting that such functional aspects (transportation) influence the perception of the area’s quality and possibly its ""local value"".
  * The author is not resisting the idea that transportation infrastructure matters for defining the quality of a ""local"" area; instead, they are implicitly endorsing it.

While this seems like a casual commentary, the author is subtly distinguishing these areas in terms of their **cultural identity, symbolic meaning, and social perception**, especially in relation to whether they are considered ""truly"" part of Beijing or not. The phrase ""不算北京"" (""not Beijing"") in reference to Yanqing is particularly significant as it implies a **standard of inclusion/exclusion** in the ""local"" identity of Beijing.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The descriptions include:  
    - Historical/cultural labels (皇城根儿, 正黄旗, 旅游景点, 环球影城, 猿人遗址)  
    - Functional or lifestyle associations (潮, 补习, 买花买鱼, 发大水, 房子, 桃儿)  
    - Environmental or quality-of-life assessments (环境好, 空气好, 西瓜好吃, 鱼好吃)  
    - Linguistic or cultural exclusion (有口音, 不算北京)  
    - Symbolic status of areas (旅游景点, zf办公区)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **historical and cultural labels** to establish symbolic boundaries (e.g., 皇城根儿, 正黄旗), which are associated with **core Beijing identity**.
  * The phrase **“不算北京”** is a clear judgment of **exclusion** from the ""local"" identity of Beijing, based on **cultural and linguistic differences** (口音).
  * The descriptions of **environmental quality** (环境好, 空气好, 西瓜好吃) serve to **evaluate the quality or appeal** of the area, which can be a **standard for assessing local value**.
  * The mention of **functional or lifestyle characteristics** (旅游景点, 潮, 补习, 买花买鱼) contributes to a **social perception** of the area and its residents, which can be used to **identify or differentiate local groups**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly defines** ""local"" areas through **cultural/historical labels** (RL1).
  * The phrase **“不算北京”** implies a **linguistic and cultural exclusion** from the ""local"" identity of Beijing (RL4).
  * The author **evaluates the quality of areas** based on environmental and functional attributes (RL5).
  * These RL elements are used to **construct a mental map** of the city and **define who or what is considered ""local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's **mental map of Beijing** is shaped by **historical and cultural labels** (RL1).
  * The **linguistic and cultural exclusion** of Yanqing (""不算北京"") is based on **dialect and cultural identity** (RL4).
  * The **evaluation of environmental and functional qualities** (环境好, 空气好, 西瓜好吃) is used to **assess the local value** of areas (RL5).

The descriptions are subjective and often include evaluations of livability, convenience, and attractiveness. The author appears to be forming a **mental map** of these districts, using specific **functional and environmental criteria** to judge their quality or ""local value.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text includes references to:
    - Housing conditions (""老破小房价高"" – old, small, and expensive housing)
    - Commercial activity and tourism (""好多宰游客的景点"" – many places that exploit tourists)
    - Educational presence (""全是学校"" – all schools)
    - Proximity and accessibility (""好远"" – far away)
    - Recreational value (""别墅区"" – villa area, ""风景不错"" – nice scenery, ""水库"" – reservoir, ""度假"" – vacation)
    - Social status (""潮人and有钱人"" – trendy and wealthy people)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses these features to **evaluate the quality or appeal of each district**, which implicitly informs their **perception of the district's ""local value""**. These evaluations are not just for description but are used to **form a judgment about the desirability or typicality of the area**, aligning with a **functional and environmental understanding of what makes a place ""local"" or ""worthwhile""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **functional livability and environmental quality** as a **basis for evaluating the districts**, and this is **explicitly used to form a judgment** about the ""local"" character of each area. Other elements like housing conditions and social status are also **used to judge the appeal or typicality of a district**, which aligns with **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** is clearly present as the author evaluates districts based on factors like convenience, accessibility, recreational value, and scenery.
  * **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** is also relevant as the author references the presence of ""trendy and wealthy people"" and ""villa areas,"" which serve as indicators of economic status and influence in the area.

  - The mention of ""地铁"" (subway) relates to a functional aspect of the area—transportation infrastructure.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""我家怀柔"" reflects a personal identification with the area, potentially signaling a sense of belonging or rootedness in the region.
  - The desire for a subway implies that the author evaluates the area's livability or value based on functional infrastructure (transportation), which may be a way to indirectly express the importance of the area being considered as part of a broader ""local"" or urban system.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The emotional connection to the area (""my hometown Huairou"") supports **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - The desire for a subway as a symbol of a more developed and connected area supports **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as it implies the author sees transportation infrastructure as a key factor in defining the area's quality and value.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implicitly conveys a sense of rootedness and identity with Huairou (""my hometown""), which aligns with **RL3**.

  * These elements are used to express the author's personal impressions and familiarity with the areas, but **not to define or judge ""local identity""**. The author is not asserting any standard for what makes someone a ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area. The references to economic status or dialect are **not framed as criteria for determining ""local identity""**, but rather as observations or preferences.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * None of the content is explicitly or implicitly used by the author to define or judge ""local identity."" The text lacks any evaluative or definitional logic regarding ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The content is descriptive and observational, and while it may include elements that could be part of RL categories, **none are used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity""**. Therefore, no RL category is applicable.

RL1"," - The author is describing how the concept of ""the city"" (城里) in Beijing has changed over time, both in terms of administrative boundaries and in how people perceive what constitutes ""the real Beijing."" The author emphasizes the historical and social recognition of certain areas as ""the city"" and how newer areas, though administratively part of Beijing, were not traditionally seen as part of the core ""local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of ""老北京的城八区"" and the distinction between ""城里"" and ""近郊/远郊"" indicate a historical and social understanding of what counts as the local core area.
  - The author explains how administrative changes occurred (e.g., ""昌平划归北京"", ""东四东单合并成东城区"") which relate to administrative legitimacy.
  - The author describes how people in the past would say ""去城里"" to refer to a core area, implying a socially conventional territorial identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The distinction between ""城里"" and ""远郊"" is central to the author’s argument about what constitutes a ""local"" area and how people historically defined their identity.
  - The historical administrative changes are mentioned to show how the city's scope has expanded, but the social perception of ""the city"" lags behind.
  - The author's tone suggests an implicit endorsement of the traditional, socially conventional understanding of ""the city"" as the core of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses the socially conventional understanding of ""城里"" to define what is considered ""local.""
  - The administrative changes are described but not used as the main criteria for defining ""local identity.""
  - The author implies that the traditional, historically accepted areas are more central to the local identity than the newer, administratively included ones.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is clearly present because the author discusses the traditional mental map of ""城里"" and how it is used to define who is ""local.""

The core argument is about **how certain areas, like Yanqing, are not ""original"" parts of Beijing due to historical administrative changes, while Fangshan is**. The author uses this as a basis to claim a **more legitimate or ""true"" local identity** for themselves and people from certain districts.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author references:
    - ""Fangshan people"" and the *Fangshan County Annals* to establish their identity.
    - Historical administrative changes (Yanqing being ""transferred"" from Hebei).
    - The idea that other districts have always been part of Beijing, while Yanqing was ""temporary"".
    - The use of history and county annals to justify identity claims.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **historical administrative changes** and **county annals** to **justify a distinction in local identity** between different districts of Beijing. The logic is that being part of the ""original"" Beijing (as opposed to areas that were ""transferred"") is a **legitimate basis for claiming a ""true"" or more authentic local identity**.
  * The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **historical administrative boundaries and affiliations** determine who is a ""true local"".

  * The phrase ""一个也不能少"" (none can be missing) implies a strong emotional or social recognition of these areas as part of a unified ""local"" identity.
  * The author contrasts old views (e.g., ""三环外是农地"" — land outside the Third Ring is farmland) with modern development (""六环里，现在六环建设也不差啊"" — within the Sixth Ring, and now the Sixth Ring is not bad at all), which hints at a shift in how the city's boundaries and identity are perceived.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to specific administrative districts (e.g., the six core districts and the 10 suburbs) functions to define what the author considers to be the legitimate and complete scope of ""Beijing"" as a local identity.
  * The contrast between old and new reflects a shift in the author's perception of what constitutes a ""local"" area — the outer areas are now seen as equally valuable and modern.

这是民国的吧。你这时间线就是乱的。一会又金国。一会又民国。金国北京和现在北京没用一点关系。现在北京始于明代。 民国十六年（1928）由于首都早迁往南京。北京慢慢就被肢解划给河北了。最后城里都没留住。直到建国才又直辖之后又陆续往回划所辖区域直到1958年才形成今天的北京。 明清顺天府（北京）其余地方还在河北手里。当然也不是复古。 您拿民国事情还能说说。金国就算了,RL2," * The author is correcting someone else's historical misunderstanding about the evolution of the city of Beijing. The author emphasizes the **historical and administrative legitimacy** of how the modern city of Beijing was formed, particularly by contrasting it with the Jin Dynasty and the Republic of China (民国) periods. The author's core intent is to clarify **which historical periods and administrative boundaries are relevant to defining the modern Beijing** and to reject the idea that the Jin Dynasty's ""Beijing"" has any relevance to the modern city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author discusses:
    - Historical periods (Jin Dynasty, Republic of China, Ming Dynasty, People's Republic of China).
    - Administrative changes (Beijing being incorporated into Hebei, then being re-established as a municipality).
    - The idea that modern Beijing's boundaries were not inherited from the Jin Dynasty or the Republic of China, but were formed through modern administrative decisions.
    - The distinction between historical and modern administrative affiliations.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **historical and administrative boundaries** as a way to define what counts as ""modern Beijing"" and to reject the idea that older dynastic or early 20th-century administrative regions can be used to define it. The author is **explicitly endorsing administrative legitimacy as a criterion** for defining the scope and identity of ""local Beijing.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly rejects using the Jin Dynasty or Republic of China's administrative or territorial concepts to define modern Beijing. Instead, the author **endorses the modern administrative boundaries and historical formation of Beijing**, particularly from the Ming Dynasty onward and especially the post-1958 administrative consolidation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's argument is built on the idea that **modern Beijing's identity and boundaries are defined through administrative legitimacy**, not through historical continuity with earlier dynasties. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the author is using legal and administrative definitions to determine what constitutes the modern ""local"" Beijing.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL2"

RL1"," The author is describing how their perception of what constitutes ""the city"" and ""local"" areas in Beijing changed during their childhood. They distinguish between different parts of the city based on a social and historical understanding of urban hierarchy and spatial identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - References to specific areas: ""东西城是北京城"", ""崇文宣武是城里破落户"", ""朝海丰是近郊"", ""其他都是远郊县城""
  - Descriptions of spatial hierarchy: ""二环是城乡分界线"", ""三环就是荒地了""
  - Use of historical and social labels to classify areas

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  These descriptions reflect a **socially constructed mental map** of the city, where certain areas are associated with higher or lower status or centrality. The author is not merely describing geography, but **how people in their time perceived the social and spatial hierarchy of Beijing**, which is a key part of defining who is ""local"" or what is considered ""central"" in the city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly endorses a **socially conventional territorial identity** based on historical and emotional perceptions of different areas. The author is not resisting this logic but is instead **describing it as a shared or commonly accepted understanding** in their time.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is using **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** to define what parts of the city are considered ""central"" or ""local"" based on **historical, emotional, and socially accepted spatial boundaries**. The descriptions of ""二环是城乡分界线"" and ""三环就是荒地了"" reflect a **mentality of how the city was perceived**, not just its physical geography.

RL1"," * The author is reflecting on how their perception of what constitutes ""Beijing"" has changed over time. They contrast their childhood view of the city (where only the East and West City areas and Tiananmen Square were considered the ""real Beijing"") with the current, more expanded urban landscape. They also imply a common international misperception of China as still largely rural.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""childhood perception"" and how they used to define ""Beijing"" in terms of specific areas.
  * They contrast this with the current, broader urban development and a general stereotype of China as rural.
  * There is a reference to the symbolic meaning of certain areas as representing the ""real"" city.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to ""childhood perception"" and how the author defined ""Beijing"" as only the central areas is used to illustrate how the concept of ""local"" or ""real"" Beijing has changed over time.
  * The contrast with the current, more expanded city suggests that the author's childhood criteria no longer apply, but it also shows that they once used a specific mental map of the city to define ""local"" identity.
  * The author’s attitude is reflective, acknowledging how the city has developed and how such perceptions may be outdated.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author's childhood mental map of Beijing (only central areas like East and West City and Tiananmen Square counted as the ""real Beijing"") is used to define what was once considered the ""local"" or ""core"" area.
  * This reflects a shift in how the city is perceived and who is considered a ""local"" based on changing urban boundaries and social recognition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implicitly uses a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) to define what was once considered ""local"" in Beijing — a mental map based on historical and emotional attachment to central areas.
  * The contrast with the current, expanded city and the international misperception of China as rural is more about urban development and perception, but does not directly relate to defining ""local identity"" criteria.

They also express a preference for Mentougou over the eastern part of the city as they grow older, possibly implying a stronger identification with Mentougou as a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""本地人占大部份"" – mentions the proportion of ""locals"" in the area.
  * ""生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多"" – describes the quality of life, environment, and population density.
  * ""不爱回东边了"" – implies a sense of regional preference or identity shift.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""本地人占大部份"" is used to describe the composition of the local population and may imply a sense of authenticity or community rootedness.
  * ""生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多"" is used to justify the author's preference for Mentougou and implicitly supports the idea that Mentougou is a better or more authentic ""local"" area.
  * ""不爱回东边了"" suggests a contrast between Mentougou and the ""eastern part"" (possibly a more urban or non-local area), reinforcing the author's alignment with Mentougou as their ""local"" identity.

The author is defending the traditional and socially conventional meaning of ""Beijing"" as a core region with deep historical and cultural significance.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ""京兆地区"" (Jingzhao region), ""天子脚下"" (under the Son of Heaven), and ""长城内的人"" (people inside the Great Wall) implies a historical and culturally embedded regional identity.
  - The phrase ""去北京=去北京城"" (Going to Beijing = going to Beijing city) and similar expressions like ""去密云城"" (going to Miyun city) suggest a preference for a historically conventional understanding of the region.
  - The author contrasts this with the modern administrative idea of ""from Hebei being incorporated into Beijing.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **rejecting** the idea that administrative boundary changes (e.g., areas being ""从河北划进来"" from Hebei) should redefine what it means to be ""local.""
  - The author is **defending** a traditional, historically rooted understanding of what constitutes the ""local"" area (e.g., ""京兆地区"", ""天子脚下"").
  - The author implies that the **socially conventional** and **historically sedimented** understanding of ""Beijing"" as a city with a specific cultural and linguistic identity is more legitimate than modern administrative divisions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the **historically and culturally sedimented** understanding of ""local identity.""
  - The author **rejects** administrative or legal definitions of local identity (e.g., ""from Hebei being incorporated into Beijing"").
  - The author uses **historical labels and socially conventional regional cognition** to define what is ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is using **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they emphasize the **historical sediment, social habit, and cultural meaning** of ""Beijing"" and its sub-regions (e.g., ""去北京城"", ""京兆地区"", ""天子脚下"").
  - The author **rejects RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as they oppose the idea that being ""from Hebei and incorporated into Beijing"" should define someone as a ""local.""

房山柿子不行，房山最大的特产是跨区打工人,RL6," * The author is making a humorous and ironic statement about the district of Fangshan, implying that its most notable ""product"" is not its agricultural produce (like persimmons) but rather the fact that many people who live there work in other districts. This reflects a critique or observation about the identity of ""local people"" in Fangshan.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text references a district (Fangshan) and its residents (跨区打工人 – cross-district workers), suggesting a contrast between the expected ""local identity"" based on agriculture and the actual identity based on commuting and work.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is not using traditional definitions of ""local identity"" (e.g., birthplace, dialect, administrative status). Instead, the author is implicitly critiquing or redefining what ""local people"" might mean in a modern urban context—those who live in Fangshan but work elsewhere, which challenges conventional territorial or cultural notions of being ""local.""
  * The phrase ""跨区打工人"" implies a form of **identity rooted in daily life patterns and economic behavior**, which could be linked to RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as it touches on economic integration and social behavior within the region.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does not explicitly use criteria like birthplace, dialect, or administrative status to define ""local identity.""
  * The author does, however, imply a new kind of identity based on **economic behavior and lifestyle patterns** (working in other districts but living in Fangshan), which is a subtle redefinition of what it means to be a ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implicitly redefines ""local identity"" in a modern urban context by referencing the **economic and social behavior** of residents (跨区打工人). This aligns with **RL6**, which includes economic status and social integration as criteria for evaluating local identity.

  - The author and their husband’s attitude toward the current area (accepting of the quietness).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **evaluating the quality of their residential area** in terms of **livability and convenience**, particularly the **lack of commercial and entertainment options**.
  - The comparison with more central areas is used to **highlight the functional shortcomings** of their current area.
  - The author **does not use these features to define who is or is not a local**, but rather to **evaluate the quality of the area** as a place to live.
  - The author is **not using these criteria to judge the legitimacy of someone’s local identity**, but rather to describe the **functional and environmental quality** of the area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **not defining or evaluating ""local identity""** based on the area’s livability or commercial features.
  - The text is a **subjective evaluation of the area’s quality of life**, but **does not use these features as a standard to judge who is a ""local"" or who is not**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - While the author **describes the functional livability and environmental quality** of the area, they **do not use these to define or evaluate ""local identity""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""二环内才是北京"" (""only the area within the Second Ring Road is Beijing"") suggests a territorial boundary.
  * The phrase ""三环就是郊区了"" (""the Third Ring is already the suburbs"") implies a shift in identity or perception.
  * The reference to ""纯老北京"" (""pure old Beijing people"") implies a group with historically rooted identity and territorial cognition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are used to describe how traditional locals define the core of Beijing, based on long-standing social and territorial cognition.
  * The author is not opposing this view but is instead reporting or endorsing it by framing it as part of the mindset of ""纯老北京"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is highlighting how traditional locals perceive the boundaries of ""true Beijing"", using a mental map based on long-standing social conventions and historical identity.
  * This is a clear example of how the author is referencing a socially conventional territorial identity to define who or what is considered ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The criteria used by the author to define ""local people"" are based on a **socially conventional mental map of the city**, where the Second Ring Road is seen as the core and the Third Ring as the suburbs. This reflects a **long-accumulated social habit and historical sediment** in how traditional locals define the city's boundaries and their own identity.

The core message is about the author's growing affection for Beijing, particularly through the kindness and awareness of local elderly residents (Beijing ""dàyé/dàmā"") toward people in need.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions being in Beijing for 5–6 years and becoming more attached to it.
  - They describe an experience with their disabled father and the behavior of Beijing residents.
  - They contrast the helpfulness of elderly residents with the lack of similar behavior from younger people.
  - The author attributes this to the ""Beijing-ness"" of the elderly, implying a cultural or social norm of care and recognition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The experience with the father is used to highlight a positive quality of the city and its people.
  - The contrast between elderly and younger residents is used to highlight a cultural or generational trait.
  - The author’s gratitude and repeated expressions of thanks reinforce the idea that this behavior is seen as a reflection of ""local"" character.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses the idea that ""local people"" (Beijing residents, especially the elderly) are identifiable by their **cultural behavior and recognition of need**, particularly in public transportation settings.
  - The author also implies that this kind of behavior is a **cultural norm** among locals, not just individuals.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The behavior of the elderly in recognizing the father's disability and offering help reflects **cultural habits and values** associated with being ""local"" in Beijing.
  - The contrast with younger people implies that **this is a traditional or long-standing local cultural trait**, which aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  - The behavior is also a **form of cultural recognition**, which aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**—specifically, the recognition of social norms and roles that define ""local"" behavior.

The author seems to be using this contrast to highlight a sense of **historical and cultural familiarity** with the eastern part and a **lack of such familiarity with the western part**, possibly implying that the eastern part is more ""authentic"" or ""local"" in their view.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions:
    - Growing up in the east.
    - Rarely going to the west.
    - Feeling the west is ""older"" or ""more traditional"" (""老派"").
    - A reference to a long-time-out-of-sight chain store (""仙踪林"") that once existed in the old central area.
    - The author's emotional reaction to rediscovering the brand.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author's **growth history** (""从小在东边"") is used to frame their identity and familiarity with a specific area, which is implicitly contrasted with the west.
  - The reference to the **historical presence** of ""仙踪林"" in the old central area is used to evoke a sense of **cultural memory and local tradition**, which is now rare or absent in other areas.
  - The author’s **subjective judgment** of the western area as ""more old-school"" (""老派"") implies a cultural or social evaluation that ties into how the author perceives the ""authenticity"" or ""localness"" of a place.
  - The **historical and symbolic meaning** of the store is used to signal a **shift in the city's cultural landscape**, which supports the author's implicit claim about what constitutes a ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses** the idea that **historical rootedness and cultural familiarity** are key to defining a ""local"" area.
  - The author implicitly **uses the presence of historical brands and cultural memory** to evaluate the ""localness"" of a place.
  - The author's **own growth history** (""从小在东边"") is used as a marker of personal ""localness"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author contrasts the east and west, and implicitly judges the west as ""more old-school"", using a sense of historical and cultural familiarity to define what is ""local"".
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author explicitly states that they were raised in the east, and this forms the basis of their familiarity and identity as a ""local"".
  - **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** – While not directly mentioned, the author's description of the west as ""老派"" (old-fashioned) and the presence of a historical brand may imply a **cultural evaluation** of the area’s ""local value"", which aligns with RL5 in terms of **perceived quality or character of a place**.

The underlying concern is whether people who live in Yanqing but work in the city can be considered as part of the ""local"" community or whether the area can sustainably develop as a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions commuting time and the use of public transportation (subway), which relates to the livability and accessibility of the area.
  * The author questions whether Yanqing can develop, implying an evaluation of its potential as a ""local"" area.
  * The author is indirectly evaluating the area based on its functional livability and accessibility to the city center.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the **long commute time and reliance on the subway** as a way to **evaluate the quality of the area** in terms of its accessibility and livability.
  * The concern about future development is based on the assumption that **an area must be convenient and accessible to be considered viable or ""local"" in a meaningful sense**.
  * The author is **implicitly using functional livability and environmental quality (in terms of accessibility and convenience)** as a standard to assess the area’s potential and local value.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **using the functional livability and environmental quality of the area** (i.e., commute time and access to the subway) as a **criterion to evaluate whether the area can be considered a ""local"" or viable area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author’s concern about the long commute and the area's future development is based on **functional livability and environmental quality**, which is a core characteristic of **RL5**.
  * The author is implicitly suggesting that an area must be **functionally livable and accessible** to be considered as a **""local"" area** with development potential.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions the lack of a metro system and the long travel time (3 hours minimum) to get to the city via long-distance buses.
  * These details are used to describe the livability and accessibility of Yanqing.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of transportation infrastructure (no metro, only long-distance buses) and the travel time is used to **evaluate the area's functional livability**, which in turn affects whether it is considered a suitable or ""ideal"" place to live for someone working in the city.
  * The author is **implicitly using the quality of transportation and accessibility as a criterion** to judge whether an area is suitable or ""local"" for a working population.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not explicitly defining ""local identity""**, but is **evaluating the functional livability of Yanqing**, which is relevant to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as the author is **using transportation and travel time to assess the area's quality as a place to live**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implies that **Yanqing is not a good ""local"" living area for someone working in the city** due to its **lack of convenient transportation (no metro) and long commute times**, which fits the definition of **RL5**.

They highlight that ""西边"" may be seen as ""土"" (rural, unsophisticated), but they interpret this as ""低调"" (low-key), and imply that there is a mutual sense of superiority and inferiority between different areas and their residents.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""朝阳"" and ""西边"" are geographic areas, with the author describing their cultural and social characteristics.
  * The author contrasts the ""洋气"" (trendy) nature of 朝阳 with the ""土"" (unsophisticated) nature of 西边, but reframes it as ""低调"".
  * The phrase ""总被西边看不起"" implies a social hierarchy or perception of worth based on region.
  * The author implies a sense of identity or social status tied to the area one is associated with.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The geographic regions (朝阳 and 西边) are used to establish a framework for social comparison and identity.
  * The author's attitude is one of partial defense of 西边, suggesting that the perception of ""土"" is not entirely negative but is rather a form of ""低调"".
  * The social relationship network (""社会关系大多在翠微周边"") implies that the author’s identity and social positioning are rooted in specific areas.
  * The contrast between the areas and their perceived status implies that **regional identity is tied to cultural and social perceptions**, and that these perceptions influence how people identify as or are seen as ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses **regional cultural perceptions and social hierarchy** to define or imply differences in local identity.
  * The author **endorses** the idea that being from a certain area (西边) can be seen as ""low-key"", but also **implies** that this is a legitimate form of local identity.
  * The **contrast between areas and their social status** is used to define how locals from different areas are perceived and how they might view each other.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's emphasis on **regional cultural perception and the mutual social hierarchy** between different areas aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author's **description of the symbolic meaning and social status** of being from 西边 (""土"" as ""低调"") reflects the **historical and social sedimentation** that defines local identity.

The core intent appears to be evaluating the **quality and value of real estate in these areas**, and implicitly linking **real estate ownership and property value** to the **perceived status or authenticity of being a ""local""** in these areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mentions of ""几代人都在海淀"" (multiple generations in Haidian) imply a **historical rootedness**.
  * Discussion of real estate (房产保值度, 跌的稀碎, 明星小区, 改善盘大平层) relates to **real estate value and ownership**, which can reflect **economic status and depth of social roots**.
  * The use of terms like ""优质房产"" (high-quality property) and ""明星小区"" (star communities) suggests **prestige and influence** in local real estate markets.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **historical presence** in Haidian (""几代人都在海淀"") to support the idea of Haidian as a stable, high-value area — implying that people with multi-generational roots are **more deeply embedded locals**.
  * The author **compares real estate values and types** across districts to show that **Xicheng and Haidian are more stable and prestigious**, while **Chaoyang is declining in value**, which reflects a **hierarchy of local identity based on property ownership and economic status**.
  * The author's **implicit preference** for Xicheng/Haidian as better real estate options is used to **support the idea that these areas are more ""authentic"" or ""valuable"" local spaces**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** is supported by ""几代人都在海淀"", which reflects a **multi-generational presence** in Haidian.

RL5"," - The author is comparing two areas, **Haidian** and **Wangjing**, and expressing a personal evaluation of their **suitability for living**, especially in terms of lifestyle and infrastructure. The author is emphasizing that **Wangjing is more livable and modern**, while **Haidian is only suitable for education**, with poor living conditions. The author **wants to move out of Haidian after education is completed**, which implies a **value judgment on the livability and quality of a ""local"" area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses **Haidian and Wangjing**, two different areas, and evaluates their **living conditions**, **convenience**, and **suitability for different groups (e.g., students vs. young people)**.
  - The author mentions **personal experience of living in both areas**, and the **decision to move back to Haidian for child education**.
  - The author describes **infrastructure and environment** in Haidian as ""破破的"" (old and run-down), and **lifestyle and convenience** in Wangjing as ""休闲自在啥都有"" (leisurely and convenient).
  - The author expresses a **clear preference for Wangjing as a better place to live**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **using the livability and quality of an area as a standard to evaluate its ""local value""**.
  - The **functional livability (convenience, infrastructure, environment)** of Wangjing is presented as **better**, making it more suitable for a ""real local"" or ideal living space.
  - The **negative evaluation of Haidian's environment and infrastructure** suggests it is not a desirable place to live beyond educational purposes.
  - The author is **not focusing on administrative, cultural, or historical criteria**, but on **what makes a place a good or bad ""local"" area in terms of living conditions**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses the idea that a ""good local"" area should be livable and convenient**, based on **infrastructure, environment, and lifestyle quality**.
  - This is a clear endorsement of **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author is using these factors to evaluate and define the quality of a ""local"" area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that a good ""local"" area should have **good infrastructure and convenience**, and that areas lacking these (like Haidian) are not ideal places to live. This aligns with **RL5**.

The mention of traffic control (""交通管制"") and ""customs queue"" further reinforces the idea of crossing into a different region with different rules.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author references ""东二环"" (2nd East Ring), ""东四环"" (4th East Ring), and ""西四环"" (4th West Ring), indicating a structured understanding of urban spatial divisions.
  * The phrase ""感觉像出国"" (feels like going abroad) suggests a strong perception of regional separation or cultural/identity difference between the areas.
  * ""交通管制"" (traffic control) and ""海关排队"" (customs queue) metaphorically imply administrative or legal boundaries between areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the spatial division of the city rings to construct a metaphor of regional separation or identity difference, comparing it to international travel.
  * The metaphor of ""feeling like going abroad"" and the reference to ""traffic control"" and ""customs queue"" imply that the author perceives the 2nd, 4th East, and 4th West Rings as distinct regions with different rules or identities.
  * This suggests that the author implicitly recognizes administrative and territorial boundaries as significant in defining the scope or separation of ""local"" areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly recognizes the city's spatial divisions (e.g., 2nd, 4th East, and 4th West Rings) as meaningful in defining different ""local"" areas.
  * The metaphor of ""feeling like going abroad"" and the mention of ""traffic control"" and ""customs queue"" indicate that the author perceives these boundaries as significant enough to evoke a sense of crossing into a different region or administrative zone.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author implicitly recognizes the city's spatial divisions as meaningful in defining different ""local"" areas, suggesting an awareness of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""房价低"" (low housing prices) and ""垃圾"" (garbage/undesirable people), which are used to judge the quality or legitimacy of the area and its inhabitants.
  * The author is implying that housing prices are a standard for evaluating the ""worth"" of an area and the people who live there.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **low housing price** as a **negative evaluation criterion**, linking it to the **perceived undesirable quality of people** in the area.
  * This suggests a **value-based judgment of the area's ""local"" status**, where housing prices are used as a proxy for social or cultural legitimacy.
  * The author is **not resisting this logic**, but instead **implicitly endorsing it** as a standard for evaluating who or what ""counts"" as part of a ""good"" local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **uses housing prices as a criterion to evaluate the quality of a local area**, and implicitly links this to the type of people living there.
  * This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as housing prices are a **symbol of economic status and are used to judge the legitimacy or value of a local area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's core argument is that **low housing prices are a negative trait**, and they **imply that this leads to undesirable people** (""垃圾"") living in the area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""最早那边是一大片荒地"" (It was originally a large piece of wasteland) — suggests the author's perception of the area's past state.
  * ""小时候去石景山游乐园时下了地铁还要走好远才到"" (As a child, going to Shijingshan Amusement Park required walking far after getting off the subway) — implies the area was not convenient or developed at that time.
  * ""边上只有荒地什么都没有"" (There was nothing but wasteland around it) — reinforces the idea of the area's lack of development and social recognition.
  * ""后来慢慢建了小区"" (Later, residential communities were gradually built) — indicates the transformation of the area into a developed, inhabited space.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the historical development of the area to contrast its past and present. The reference to the area being ""荒地"" (wasteland) and later being developed into a ""小区"" (residential community) reflects a change in the area's status and possibly its social recognition.

They emphasize how they once viewed areas beyond certain landmarks as ""rural"" or ""suburban,"" and how they distinguished these areas from the urban core through historical, geographical, and social markers.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions:
    - ""土生土长的北京人"" (born and raised in Beijing) → RL3
    - Specific boundaries like ""东大桥"", ""官园"", ""北三环"", ""自然博物馆"" as demarcations of ""urban vs. rural"" → RL1
    - Reference to old administrative or social labels like ""郊县"", ""郊直费"", ""通县"", ""顺义"", ""延庆"" → RL1 and RL2
    - Implies a sense of familiarity and identity with the city core and unfamiliarity with the outer areas → RL1 and RL3

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using their **personal growth history and deep-rooted urban identity** (RL3) to frame how they **perceive the boundaries of ""local""** (RL1).
  - The **mental map of the city** (RL1) is based on **historical and socially conventional understandings** of what constitutes the urban core and what is considered ""rural"" or ""suburban.""
  - The **author's attitude is nostalgic and somewhat self-aware**, acknowledging that their view is ""陈旧"" (outdated), but it still reflects how they personally used to define ""local"" boundaries.

  * There is a reference to **historical administrative changes** and how they affect local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **specific place names and smaller geographic units** to demonstrate how **local identity is rooted in localized, familiar areas**, not in broader administrative divisions.
  * The author implies that **local people's identity is tied to the small-scale areas they live in**, and that **the use of ""district"" is a simplification for outsiders**.
  * The reference to **historical administrative changes** supports the idea that **local identity is more stable and rooted in personal experience and familiarity**, not in shifting administrative boundaries.
  * The author is **implicitly endorsing a form of local identity based on localized, familiar, and historically rooted place names**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly **rejects the use of broader administrative divisions (like districts)** as the basis for local identity.
  * The author **endorses the use of small-scale, historically rooted, and familiar place names** as the basis for local identity.
  * The author **emphasizes the role of historical administrative changes** in shaping how people perceive local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's discussion of **how local people identify with specific, small-scale areas** (e.g., streets, villages) rather than administrative districts aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  * The author's **emphasis on how local identity is rooted in personal experience and familiarity with specific places**, and how historical changes in administrative divisions affect identity perception, also supports **RL1**.
  * The author is **not using administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a criterion for defining local identity, but rather **rejecting it in favor of more localized, familiar, and historically rooted territorial identity**.

小时候不理解为什么老是说自己是老余杭的都是说去杭州玩，直到在杭州读大学被本地的几个人骂了一顿说我市区没房子不要说自己是杭州人之后我就有点理解了（当时只是报名后刚刚好一起去吃饭然后聊天聊起是那里人，我说我杭州的，然后细问知道我是余杭的后，就说我乡下人不要硬贴说自己是杭州人），只说自己杭州郊区或者直接说老余杭的,"RL1, RL4, RL6"," The author reflects on their personal experience of being judged and mocked for identifying as ""from Hangzhou"" when they are actually from Yuhang. The key takeaway is the realization that **being considered a ""true local"" of Hangzhou is not just about birthplace or upbringing in the broader Hangzhou area, but about living in the ""core"" urban area (Hangzhou city proper) and owning property there**. The author is highlighting the **social boundaries and exclusion** that exist in how local identity is defined.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ""老余杭"" (old Yuhang) as a specific area.
  - The contrast between being from Yuhang (a suburb) and being from the ""real"" Hangzhou (city proper).
  - The idea that **owning property in the city center is a key marker of being a ""real"" local**.
  - The **social judgment** and **exclusion** faced by the author for not meeting the local identity standard.
  - The **shift in the author’s self-identification** from claiming to be from Hangzhou to being more specific about being from Yuhang.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **contrast between Yuhang and Hangzhou city proper** is central to the author's understanding of local identity.
  - **Property ownership** in the city is used as a **marker of legitimacy** in claiming local identity.
  - The **social exclusion** the author experienced is a result of **not meeting the criteria** that others use to define ""true locals"".
  - The **author’s own shift in self-identification** shows that **they now accept the criteria others use**, reinforcing the idea that local identity is defined by **urban core residency and property ownership**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author now **aligns with the logic** that **only those living in the city center and owning property there are considered ""true locals""**.
  - The author **implicitly accepts** that **suburban origin is not enough to be considered a ""Hangzhou person""** in the eyes of the core locals.
  - The author **internalizes the logic** that **urban residency and property ownership are key to local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author discusses the **cognitive boundary between Yuhang and Hangzhou proper**, showing how **Hangzhou city is seen as the core area of local identity** while Yuhang is viewed as ""rural"" or ""suburban"", thus not fully local.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author experiences **exclusion based on lack of property ownership in the city center**, which is **used as a symbol of economic status and depth of social roots** to determine whether one is a ""true local"".
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: While not directly mentioned, the **social judgment and labeling as ""乡下人"" (rural person)** implies a **cultural or social hierarchy** that **uses origin and identity markers** to distinguish between insiders and outsiders.

RL1"," * The author expresses a sense of exclusion and lack of belonging, indicating that people from Yuhang (余杭) are not seen as part of the ""true"" or ""core"" local group in Hangzhou. The author is asserting that there is a distinction between being from Yuhang and being considered a ""real"" Hangzhou local, and this distinction is based on a shared regional identity and social recognition.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions the phrase “去杭州” (go to Hangzhou) rather than “去市区” (go to the city center), suggesting a conceptual separation between Yuhang and the core city of Hangzhou.
  * The author emphasizes a lack of ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) and being treated as ""自己人"" (one of us), indicating a social recognition issue.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The use of “去杭州” instead of “去市区” implies a mental map or socially conventional territorial identity where Yuhang is not considered part of the core Hangzhou identity.
  * The lack of social recognition (""人家也不当我们是自己人"") reinforces the idea that the author and others from Yuhang are not considered insiders in the local identity system.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly endorsing a regional identity framework where Yuhang is not fully integrated into the Hangzhou ""local"" identity system, based on social convention and mental mapping.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's statement reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), where the distinction between Yuhang and the ""true"" Hangzhou is based on long-standing social habits and identity boundaries.

They are arguing that many people who are born with urban household registration (hukou), whose parents work in urban sectors (such as factory workers or civil servants), and who do not have land, should not be considered ""rural"" or ""乡下"". The author is resisting the idea that such a broad definition would make almost everyone in the country ""rural"", which they find absurd or misleading.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **household registration (hukou)**: ""出生就是城镇户口"" (born with urban hukou)
  - Mention of **parental occupation**: ""父母都是工人或者事业单位公务员"" (parents are factory workers or civil servants)
  - Mention of **lack of land ownership**: ""家里没有土地""
  - The author is **challenging** the idea that these people should be considered ""乡下"" (rural), suggesting that this **definition is flawed or overly broad**.
  - The author is **resisting** the use of **administrative or historical rootedness** as a criterion for defining rural identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **explicitly rejecting** the use of **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** as a defining criterion for ""rural"" identity, because they argue that people with urban hukou should not be labeled as ""rural"".
  - The author is **implicitly challenging** **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**, as they question whether people who were born and raised in urban environments with no land or rural background should be considered ""rural"".
  - The author is **not endorsing** any specific RL criteria for defining ""local"" or ""rural"" identity. Instead, they are **resisting** the criteria that are being used to label people as ""乡下"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** any RL criteria.
  - The author is **resisting** the use of **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** as valid criteria for defining ""rural"" identity.
  - The author is **not using** any RL logic to define ""local"" identity in a way that aligns with the task's objective.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **resisting** RL2 and RL3, but **not endorsing** any RL criteria themselves.
  - The author is not using any RL logic to define ""local"" identity in a way that meets the task's objective.

RL3"," - The author is expressing frustration and resistance to being labeled as an outsider or ""rural person"" despite having lived and studied in Yuhang (a district of Hangzhou) for 12 years. They reject the idea that Hangzhou is a ""pure"" local area that excludes people like them and argue that Hangzhou itself was built by incorporating many outsiders. The author is defending their right to be considered a ""local"" and is challenging the conventional territorial identity of Hangzhou.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""余杭读了12年书"" (studied in Yuhang for 12 years) – relates to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - ""那边又歧视我们，说我们乡下人"" (they discriminate against us, calling us ""rural people"") – relates to RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) and RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition), as it implies social segregation and cultural identity boundaries.
  - ""老底子杭州屁大点地方，吞了多少才发展起来"" (the original Hangzhou was a small place that only developed by absorbing many others) – relates to RL1 and implicitly resists RL2 and RL4, as it challenges the idea of a pure, historically bounded Hangzhou identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The 12 years in Yuhang is used to argue for their rootedness and claim to local identity (RL3).
  - The experience of being called ""rural people"" is used to highlight the social segregation and conventional territorial identity of Hangzhou (RL1).
  - The historical development of Hangzhou is used to challenge the legitimacy of current territorial and cultural identity claims, suggesting that the city's growth depended on outsiders (resisting RL1 and RL2).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** RL3 as a legitimate basis for local identity.
  - The author **challenges** RL1 and RL4 by pointing out the social exclusion and the historical fact that Hangzhou was not always a ""pure"" local area.
  - The author **does not endorse** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) or RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), and the text does not provide evidence for RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition) or RL7 (Occupational Symbolism).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's claim to being a ""local"" is based on their long-term growth and education history in Yuhang, which aligns with **RL3**.
  - The author critiques the conventional territorial identity and cultural exclusion practices in Hangzhou, which aligns with **RL1** (though this is a resisted criterion, not an endorsed one, so it is not annotated).
  - No other RL categories are clearly endorsed by the author in the context of defining ""local identity.""

The author seems to be emphasizing that this dialect is specific to the old urban area of Hangzhou, and that even a few kilometers away, accents can differ significantly. The tone is light-hearted and humorous.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions specific neighborhood names (e.g., Wulinmen), which are geographically specific.
  * It refers to the ""Hangzhou dialect"" (特指老市区范围的杭州话), implying a linguistic marker of local identity.
  * The phrase ""口音差异"" (accent differences) highlights that linguistic features are used to distinguish between different localities.
  * The author seems to imply that being able to identify a Hangzhou neighborhood is a sign of being a ""local"", and that the Hangzhou dialect is a marker of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of specific Hangzhou neighborhoods (e.g., Wulinmen) implies a territorial identification with the city.
  * The switch to Hangzhou dialect is framed as a result of correctly identifying a local neighborhood, suggesting that linguistic fluency is a criterion for being recognized as a local.
  * The author implies that the Hangzhou dialect is not uniform across the city, but varies by area, especially in the old urban area. This supports the idea that linguistic identity is tied to specific localities.
  * The author is implicitly endorsing the use of linguistic markers (Hangzhou dialect) and geographic knowledge (specific neighborhoods) as criteria for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly uses knowledge of specific Hangzhou neighborhoods to define local identity.
  * The author explicitly uses the Hangzhou dialect as a marker of local identity, particularly the dialect of the old urban area.
  * The author implies that linguistic fluency and geographic knowledge are linked and used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author references specific neighborhoods in Hangzhou (e.g., Wulinmen, Caihe), which are part of a shared mental map or geographic identity for Hangzhou locals. These names imply a conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""core"" or ""local"" areas of the city.
  * **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author directly references the Hangzhou dialect as a marker of local identity, particularly the dialect of the old urban area. The ability to switch to this dialect is presented as a sign of being a local.

别说其他区了，我是西湖区三墩的浙大紫金港这边，小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州。对外都说自己三墩乡下人。,"RL1, RL3"," - The author is expressing a sense of identity rooted in their upbringing in a specific neighborhood (三墩) and their perception of that area as ""rural"" or ""outside"" the core of the city (杭州). The key point is that the author feels a distinction between their childhood neighborhood and the city center, and this shapes how they identify themselves in relation to the broader city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""西湖区三墩"" – a specific geographical area.
  - ""浙大紫金港"" – a university area, potentially indicating a different social or cultural environment.
  - ""小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州"" – implies that the author's childhood area is considered outside the city center.
  - ""对外都说自己三墩乡下人"" – the author self-identifies as a ""rural person"" from 三墩, suggesting a perceived social or cultural difference.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The geographical references (西湖区三墩, 龙翔桥) are used to draw a boundary between what is considered the city (杭州) and what is not.
  - The self-identification as ""乡下人"" (rural person) implies a socially conventional view of what constitutes the ""core"" or ""urban"" area, and by contrast, what is ""local"" in a more peripheral or traditional sense.
  - The author is implicitly accepting a territorial logic of identity where one's childhood location defines their local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses the **geographical and historical background of where they grew up** as a basis for how they define themselves in relation to the city.
  - This is **not a resisted or negated criterion**, but rather a self-identification based on **growth history and social perception of the area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author identifies with a **specific local area (三墩)** and **self-identifies as a ""乡下人""** from that area, implying that this is how they define their local identity.
  - This aligns with **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, as it involves a **mental map or social perception of what constitutes the ""local"" and the ""non-local""** within the city.
  - Additionally, the author's **childhood upbringing in 三墩** is a **key factor in their local identity**, which aligns with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**.

They are pointing out that the perception of ""local identity"" in the broader context of the Hangzhou area is complicated by social attitudes, administrative practices, and a lack of emotional or psychological belonging. The author suggests that asking someone ""where are you from"" is not just about physical origin but about how that person identifies with a place emotionally and socially.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""杭州市区"" (Hangzhou urban area), ""周边的"" (surrounding areas), and implies a distinction between them.
  * The phrase ""瞧不起周边的"" suggests social superiority or a sense of exclusion based on region.
  * ""政府做的不地道"" (the government acted improperly) implies dissatisfaction with administrative legitimacy.
  * The phrase ""很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感"" (people from many districts don’t feel a sense of belonging to Hangzhou) implies a disconnect between administrative boundaries and emotional identification.
  * The author is responding to the question of identity, which touches on how people define their own ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is highlighting that the perception of being a ""local"" is influenced by **social attitudes** (RL1), **administrative practices** (RL2), and **emotional attachment or lack thereof** (RL1 again). 
  * The author implicitly criticizes the idea that administrative boundaries or official policies define a person's ""local identity,"" suggesting instead that identity is more fluid and subjective.
  * The author is **not endorsing** the superiority of the urban area or administrative legitimacy but is **highlighting the problems** with these criteria in defining who is a ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not endorsing** the idea that being from the urban area makes one a ""true local.""
  * The author **does imply** that emotional or psychological belonging (or lack thereof) is a factor in how people define their ""local identity.""
  * The author **does not endorse** administrative legitimacy as a valid basis for defining local identity but **points out its influence** on people’s feelings of belonging.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1** is relevant because the author is discussing how people from different areas (urban vs. surrounding) have different identities and emotional attachments to the city. The lack of a sense of belonging is tied to how people define their identity in relation to the city.
  * **RL2** is also relevant because the author references the government’s actions as a reason for the lack of belonging, suggesting that administrative decisions impact the perception of who is a ""real"" local.
  * The author is not endorsing these criteria but is **pointing out their role** in shaping people's identity.

They imply a cultural and possibly linguistic difference between themselves and those from the urban core of Hangzhou.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The mention of ""西湖区三墩镇"" (West Lake District Sanben Town) implies a **specific geographic identity**.
  - The phrase ""都说自己杭州乡下人"" (say I am a person from the countryside of Hangzhou) suggests a **self-identification as ""non-core local"" or ""rural local""** within the city.
  - The phrase ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" (speak differently from the city people) implies a **linguistic or cultural distinction** between ""city people"" and ""country people"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to Sanben Town and the self-identification as ""Hangzhou countryside person"" suggests a **regional identity framework** (RL1).
  - The contrast between ""city people"" and ""country people"" and the mention of speaking differently implies a **cultural-linguistic distinction** (RL4).
  - The author is **not resisting** these distinctions, but rather **using them to describe their own identity** and how they differ from others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

They highlight linguistic and cultural distinctions between ""rural"" and ""urban"" areas and suggest a subtle hierarchy or social perception where urban residents may look down on rural ones, despite the latter being wealthier.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author refers to ""西湖区"" (Xihu District) as a ""乡下地方"" (rural area), and contrasts it with ""上城下城"" (Shangcheng and Xiacheng districts) as more urban.
  * The author emphasizes the language spoken in these areas: ""老余杭的话"" (Old Yuhang dialect) versus ""杭州话"" (Hangzhou dialect).
  * The author implies a social attitude or hierarchy where urban residents may look down on rural ones.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The distinction between ""rural"" and ""urban"" is used to establish a sense of identity and difference.
  * The use of language (specific dialects) is a marker of regional and cultural identity.

The author is using language and dialect as a marker to distinguish between ""urban"" and ""rural"" or ""local"" and ""non-local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key elements are:
    - ""西湖区也是乡下"" (West Lake District is also the countryside)
    - ""我们这讲的都是余杭话"" (we speak Yuhang dialect here)
    - ""其他几个区讲的都是杭州话"" (other districts speak Hangzhou dialect)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **language and dialect** as a **defining boundary** between what counts as ""local"" (Hangzhou dialect speakers) and what is considered ""non-local"" or ""countryside"" (Yuhang dialect speakers).
  * This is a clear **implicit assertion** that **speaking a different dialect** is a **basis for defining ""local identity""** and **excluding a region from the core ""city"" identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using **language/dialect** as a **criterion to judge whether a place or its people are ""local"" or not**.
  * This is a strong example of **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, where **language and dialect** are used to distinguish insiders/outsiders and define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that **speaking a different dialect (Yuhang vs. Hangzhou dialect)** is a **basis for determining whether a region or its people are ""local"" or ""non-local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The mention of ""Fuyang used to be an independent city"" and ""was incorporated into Hangzhou"" relates to **administrative changes**.
  * The author implies a **change in the definition of what constitutes the ""local"" area** due to this administrative decision.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to administrative incorporation (""划进"") suggests that the **author recognizes the legal/administrative boundary change** as a factor in defining what is now considered part of ""Hangzhou"".
  * The author's identity as being ""from Fuyang"" implies that **they may still identify with their original local identity**, even after the administrative change.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author references **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a defining factor in the regional scope of ""Hangzhou"".
  * The author does **not explicitly resist** this criterion but **acknowledges and implicitly accepts** it as a valid change in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's statement reflects an **acknowledgment of the administrative legitimacy** (RL2) in defining what areas now belong to Hangzhou and by extension, who may be considered local.

The author is asserting that people from areas like Qibao do not consider themselves as part of the ""real"" city center (市中心) and that the current administrative or conceptual boundary expansion is problematic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase “你划的滨江萧山这边本地人” (you define people from Binjiang Xiaoshan as locals) implies the author is critiquing the boundary definition of who counts as local.
  * “平时去市区都会说：去杭州玩” (they usually say “going to Hangzhou for fun” when going to the city center) implies a psychological or cultural distinction between the area defined as ""local"" and the city center.
  * “还有东边划得都到七堡了” (the eastern boundary is now drawn all the way to Qibao) refers to a territorial or administrative boundary change.
  * “我那边的同学可不认为他是市中心的” (my classmates from that area don’t consider themselves as part of the city center) shows a contrast in identity perception.
  * “你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗” (you're drawing the boundary by including your own home first) implies a critique of how the boundary is being drawn arbitrarily or self-servingly.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is critiquing the territorial or administrative definition of ""local"" and arguing that it is being expanded to include areas where people do not identify as part of the ""real"" city center.
  * The phrase “去杭州玩” shows a cultural and psychological distinction between the ""local"" area and the city center, implying that the author believes there is a real boundary in identity and perception.
  * The reference to Qibao and the author’s classmates implies that the author believes that identity is tied to how people self-identify and not just to administrative boundaries.
  * The author is resisting the idea that administrative expansion equates to identity inclusion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, as they are critiquing how the boundary of ""local"" is being drawn and pointing out that people from newly included areas do not identify as part of the ""real"" local group.
  * The author is **not endorsing** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), as they are resisting the idea that administrative inclusion equals local identity.
  * The author is not using RL3, RL4, RL5, or RL6 as criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this text.
  * The author is **not using** RL7 in this context.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **RL1** to express that there is a **socially conventional and psychologically accepted boundary of what constitutes the ""local"" identity**, and that administrative expansion does not align with how people actually identify themselves.

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,"RL1, RL3"," - The author is using a personal anecdote about a former colleague to highlight how a self-identified ""local"" person (a ""native Hangzhou resident"") has a limited geographical awareness, only recognizing three main roads in the city. The tone is somewhat humorous and subtly critical of the colleague's limited local knowledge, while also implying that being a ""local"" is tied to familiarity with certain key areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (native Hangzhou resident): This is a direct reference to local identity.
  - The three specific roads (解放路, 凤起路, 庆春路) are likely central or historically significant in Hangzhou, and the author implies that knowing them is part of being a ""real local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the phrase ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" to establish the colleague's presumed strong local identity.
  - The limited knowledge of only three roads is presented as ironic or humorous, suggesting that **true local identity** should involve a broader, more comprehensive geographical and cultural familiarity.
  - The three roads mentioned may carry symbolic or historical significance in Hangzhou, and their recognition is used as a proxy for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that **being a ""local"" involves familiarity with key geographical or historically significant areas** in the city.
  - The phrase ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" aligns with **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as it refers to someone born and raised in the city.
  - The reference to three specific roads and the assumption that a ""real local"" should know them aligns with **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), as it reflects a socially accepted standard of what constitutes a ""local"" and the mental map of the city that is expected of a ""true"" local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is relevant because the author implies that a ""real local"" should have a broader, more conventional mental map of the city, and the limited knowledge of only three roads is presented as a contrast to that ideal.
  - **RL3** is relevant because the author uses the phrase ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" to denote a person with a deep, generational connection to the city, which is a key component of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1, RL3"

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""划到萧山"" and ""划进去"" refer to administrative boundary changes.
  * The desire to ""体验住在市区是啥体验"" reflects a wish to be recognized as part of the ""city center"" or urban core.
  * The request implies that being ""in the city"" is a status or identity marker.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the idea of administrative boundary changes (""划到萧山"") to suggest a shift in what is considered the ""city center"" or ""urban area"".
  * The author implicitly believes that being included in the ""city"" is a desirable identity or status, and that this inclusion is defined by administrative decisions.
  * The author's attitude is playful but also shows a desire to be recognized as part of the ""urban"" or ""city"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using the concept of administrative boundary changes to define what counts as the ""city center"", which is a clear endorsement of using administrative legitimacy to define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's reference to ""划到萧山"" and the request to ""划进去"" aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author is using administrative boundary changes to define what is considered part of the ""city center"" or ""urban area"", and by implication, who is considered ""local"" or part of the core urban identity.

  * The author mentions ""Hangzhou people must speak Hangzhou dialect"", ""Xiaoshan dialect is not understood by Hangzhou people"", and ""Xiaoshan was forcibly incorporated into Hangzhou city"". These elements are related to **RL1** (territorial identity and cultural differences), **RL2** (administrative legitimacy), and **RL4** (cultural-linguistic recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **linguistic/cultural difference** (RL4) between Hangzhou and Xiaoshan to argue that Xiaoshan should not be considered part of the ""true"" Hangzhou. The **administrative decision** (RL2) to include Xiaoshan is criticized as illegitimate or imposed. The author also implies that there is a **psychological and cultural boundary** (RL1) between the two areas, with Hangzhou having a distinct identity that Xiaoshan does not share.

"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。

RL1"," The author is explaining the historical and cultural evolution of the concept of ""Guangzhou city,"" highlighting the difference between the historical ""old Guangzhou"" and the modern administrative ""Guangzhou city."" The author emphasizes that the perception of what constitutes the ""core"" of Guangzhou differs between outsiders and locals, especially among native Guangzhou residents (""老广"") and Cantonese (""广府人"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author distinguishes between ""historical Guangzhou"" and ""modern Guangzhou city.""
  - The author mentions how different groups (outsiders vs. locals) define the ""core"" of Guangzhou differently.
  - The author refers to ""老广"" and ""广府人"" as groups with specific historical and cultural roots in Guangzhou.
  - The author describes how ""老四区"" (the four traditional districts) are considered the real ""Guangzhou city"" by locals.
  - The author emphasizes the historical and cultural continuity of the old city (e.g., ""任嚣城"" as the origin of Guangzhou).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The distinction between historical and modern definitions of Guangzhou serves to establish the **author's view of what constitutes a ""true"" local**.
  - The reference to ""老广"" and ""广府人"" implies a **historical and cultural rootedness** in the city.
  - The mention of ""老四区"" and their symbolic meaning (e.g., as the core of Guangzhou) supports the idea that **regional identity is based on historical and social conventions**.
  - The author uses these elements to argue that **local identity is tied to a specific historical and territorial understanding of the city**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author endorses the idea that **local identity is tied to a historically and culturally rooted territorial understanding of the city**.
  - The author uses **historical and conventional territorial divisions** to define what constitutes the ""true"" Guangzhou for locals.
  - The author implicitly supports the **cultural and historical continuity** of the old city as a key to defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that people should use the logic or standards represented by **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** to define who is/is not 'local', or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area. The author emphasizes that **local identity is based on a long-accumulated understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" Guangzhou**, which includes specific historical and cultural areas like the ""老四区"" and the old city.

The author's intent appears to be informative, documenting the evolution of the area’s administrative status and its historical name changes. There is no explicit or implicit argument about who constitutes ""local people"" or what defines ""local identity.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text includes references to administrative boundaries and affiliations over time, such as being part of ""南海县"" (Nanhai County), ""番禺"" (Panyu), and eventually becoming a district of Guangzhou. These are potentially related to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author's primary goal is to trace the administrative history of the area. There is no indication that the author is using this historical data to define or judge ""local identity"" in the present. The administrative changes are described factually, without being framed as criteria for determining who is or is not a ""local person.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * While the text contains administrative information, it does not show that the author is using this information to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate who is a ""local person."" The author is simply recounting historical facts without implying any current identity criteria.

RL1"," * The author is discussing the boundaries or scope of what is considered a ""local"" area, specifically in the context of Guangzhou. The core intent is to clarify which areas are traditionally or historically considered part of the ""local"" identity and which are not.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text refers to specific areas (e.g., 东山, 越秀区, 矿泉街道, 桂花岗), and the use of the phrase “还没并入” and “后来并入” suggests a historical or administrative shift in the definition of the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the **historical and administrative status** of these areas to **differentiate between what is traditionally considered ""local"" and what is not**. The phrase “还没并入” (not yet incorporated) implies that the author holds the view that only areas that have not been administratively incorporated into the current urban structure are considered ""true"" or ""core"" local areas. This reflects a **mental map of local identity** based on historical boundaries and social recognition.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses **historical administrative boundaries and social recognition** as the basis for defining what counts as a ""local"" area. This aligns with a **socially conventional territorial identity**.

  * The mention of language (白话) as a marker of local identity.
  * The observation that people from Guangxi and Hunan are particularly common among those who can speak the local language.
  * The implication that language is a key factor in being considered part of the ""local"" group.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the **ability to speak the local dialect** as a **proxy for local identity**, but is also noting that **non-locals can possess this trait**, which may challenge the exclusivity of the local identity defined by language.
  * The author’s attitude seems to be **observational or slightly critical**, possibly implying that the **cultural-linguistic boundary of local identity is not as exclusive as one might assume**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The **ability to speak the local language (白话)** is clearly used as a **criterion for local identity**, and the author is **acknowledging or highlighting this**.
  * The author is **not opposing this criterion**, but is **pointing out that it is not exclusive to actual locals**, which suggests a **re-evaluation or questioning of the criterion’s exclusivity**.
  * The mention of **Guangxi and Hunan people** as a significant group among those who speak the local language may **imply that regional origin is also a relevant factor**, though not explicitly used as a defining criterion in this case.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The **ability to speak the local language** falls under **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it is used to judge whether someone is part of the ""local people"" group.
  * The **regional origin** of Guangxi and Hunan people is **not used as a defining criterion** for local identity in this text, so it is **not annotated**.

The author seems to value the use of the local language and implies that being able to speak the local dialect is a sign of belonging and authenticity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The use of the local language (""白话"" = Cantonese) is emphasized.
  * There is a contrast between ""local people"" and ""unfriendly outsiders.""
  * The author implies that speaking the local language is a sign of being ""one of us.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the ability to speak Cantonese as a distinguishing factor between locals and outsiders.
  * The negative reaction of outsiders to the use of Cantonese is portrayed as a sign of not being ""local.""
  * The author's positive attitude is toward the local people who ""really learn"" and use the local language, which is implicitly a marker of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

The author dismisses irrelevant factors like whether someone buys a ticket to the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall, suggesting that such external behaviors are not relevant to the definition of being a ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""祠堂有你的名字"" (your name is in the clan hall)
  - ""广州人"" (Guangzhou person/local)
  - ""这是最基本的"" (this is the most fundamental)
  - ""跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系"" (has nothing to do with whether you buy a ticket to the Chen Clan Hall)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""祠堂有你的名字"" is central to the author's argument and is presented as a **basic and essential condition** for being considered a local.
  - The author **rejects** the idea that superficial behaviors (like buying a ticket) are relevant to local identity, reinforcing the **importance of ancestral and familial roots**.
  - The author's attitude is **supportive and assertive** toward the idea that being listed in a clan hall is a defining marker of being a ""real"" Guangzhou person.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **being listed in a clan hall (祠堂有你的名字)** is a **core criterion** for being a ""local"" in Guangzhou.
  - This is **not a superficial or external behavior** like buying a ticket, but rather a **deep-rooted, ancestral connection**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's argument is centered on **ancestral and family historical rootedness** as the core of local identity.
  - This matches **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, which emphasizes **family heritage and intergenerational presence** as the basis for local identity.
  - The author is not referencing administrative boundaries (RL2), language (RL4), livability (RL5), economic status (RL6), or occupation (RL7).

RL6"," * The author is expressing a dismissive attitude toward a situation related to Tanka Village (陈家祠), suggesting that whether someone is involved or affected depends on whether they have a share in the village's benefits (分红), and if not, it is irrelevant to them.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""分红"" (dividends) implies a financial stake or ownership in a local community or village.
  * The phrase ""就关你事"" and ""过主啦"" (it's none of your business) implies a boundary or exclusionary logic based on economic or property ownership.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the concept of financial stake or ownership (分红) to determine whether someone is ""involved"" or ""local"" in the sense of having a legitimate claim or interest in the area.
  * The exclusionary logic implies that only those with a financial stake are considered as having relevance or belonging.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implies that being a ""local"" or having relevance to the area is tied to owning or benefiting from local resources, particularly through dividends or property ownership.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author is questioning the legitimacy of claiming ""local identity"" or clan affiliation based on shared surnames or distant ancestry without actual ancestral roots (e.g.,祠堂, 祖坟). The core intent is to emphasize that **true local or clan identity requires deep historical and physical roots**, not just surname or partial lineage.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of family background (""我阿公阿婆那边以前还算地主"")
  - Reference to ancestral surnames and clan ties (""姓氏和他们以前所在地方村子大姓相同"")
  - Discussion about ancestral buildings (""祠堂又不是我们家这边的"")
  - Mention of ancestral worship (""拜山都都只拜到太公那代"")
  - Emphasis on the necessity of actual ancestral roots for legitimacy (""祠堂，不是大宗族哪里来的祠堂，哪里来修族谱"")

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **rejecting** the idea that shared surnames or partial ancestral connections are enough to claim clan or local identity.
  - The author **emphasizes** the need for actual historical and physical ties (祠堂, 祖坟, 大宗族) to define legitimacy in clan or local identity.
  - The author **implicitly critiques** modern clan reconstruction efforts as insufficient for authentic identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly believes that **true local/clan identity requires intergenerational heritage and physical roots** (祠堂, 祖坟, 大宗族), not just surname or partial lineage.
  - The author **does not accept** the legitimacy of reconstructed or superficial connections to the past.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's argument is grounded in the **historical rootedness** of a family within a community, emphasizing the need for **intergenerational heritage** and **physical ancestral presence** (祠堂, 祖坟) to define legitimate local or clan identity. This aligns with the criteria of **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.

  * The author contrasts ""villages with dividends"" with the ""true"" Guangzhou, implying that such villages are not part of the core area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The specific boundary descriptions serve to **establish the socially accepted or historically recognized scope of ""local Guangzhou""**, which is used to distinguish ""true locals"" from outsiders.
  * The exclusion of ""villages with dividends"" from the ""true"" Guangzhou suggests that **economic status or property ownership in certain areas does not equate to being a ""local""** in the author's view.

  * The author **rejects economic status or property ownership in peripheral areas** as a valid basis for being considered a ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is asserting that ""local Guangzhou"" is defined by **historically and socially accepted territorial boundaries**, not by economic ties such as village dividends.

They argue that villagers who were once seen as outsiders (乡下人) now have a higher standard of living than former urban residents. The author also criticizes the narrow criteria (祠堂分红 + 老三区) that some people use to define ""true Guangzhou people"", suggesting that such criteria are unrealistic and divisive.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author references historical perceptions of villagers as outsiders.
  - The author discusses how urbanization has changed the economic status of villagers.
  - The author mentions language (粤语) as a marker of local identity.
  - The author critiques the criteria of ""祠堂分红"" (ancestral hall dividends) and ""老三区"" (three original urban districts) as requirements for being a ""true Guangzhou person"".
  - The author implies that these criteria are used to exclude people who do not meet them.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - Historical perception of villagers as outsiders supports the idea that local identity can change over time (RL1).
  - Economic status is used to contrast the changing nature of local identity (but not as a defining criterion for ""local people"", so **not annotated**).
  - Language (粤语) is presented as a current marker of local identity (RL4).
  - Ancestral hall dividends and location in the old urban districts are presented as criteria that others use, but the author **resists** them, arguing they are unrealistic (so **not annotated**).
  - The author's own criteria for local identity seem to be based on language and historical social perceptions (RL1 and RL4).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly conveys that **historical social perceptions and linguistic recognition** are the relevant criteria for defining ""local people"".
  - The author **does not endorse** economic status or administrative/heritage-based criteria as defining ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **historical regional perceptions** (once seeing villagers as outsiders) and **current linguistic recognition** (speaking Cantonese) are the key to defining who is a ""local person"" in Guangzhou. These criteria are used to contrast against narrow and exclusionary standards that others propose.

The author finds this logic strange and is expressing a critical or questioning attitude toward it.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""赤岗d村民"" (villager from Chigang): implies a territorial or local identity.
  - ""乡下系三水"" (hometown is Sanshui): indicates a family or ancestral origin.
  - ""分红"" (dividends): implies economic ties or ownership.
  - ""祠堂"" (ancestral hall): represents cultural or familial roots.
  - The author questions why people think having these is what makes someone a ""true local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **not endorsing** the logic that ""having dividends and祠堂 makes you a true local"".
  - Instead, the author is **critiquing** or questioning that logic, indicating that they **do not agree** with using these as criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - However, the author **does imply** that people in the local context do use these criteria, which is relevant to RL3 and RL6.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

  - The author is **describing** a local logic (that some people use dividends and祠堂 to define ""true locals"") but **not endorsing** it.
  - The author is **not expressing their own criteria** for defining ""local identity"" in a clear or explicit way.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **does not clearly endorse** any RL category.
  - The reference to ""分红"" and ""祠堂"" may be interpreted as **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**, but since the author is **questioning** this logic rather than endorsing it, these should **not be annotated**.

They also mention that most villages with land dividends are **not within this ""true"" Guangzhou**, implying that such villages are not considered ""local"" in the author's definition.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author explicitly defines the **geographical boundaries** of Guangzhou.
  * They reference **historical and culturally recognized areas** such as 西关 (Xiguan), 东山 (Dongshan), 三元里 (Sanyuanli), and 河南 (Henan).
  * They distinguish between ""Guangzhou"" and surrounding villages with dividends, implying a **social or cultural boundary**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The **geographical boundaries** are used to define what counts as the **core of ""local Guangzhou""**.
  * The **historical and culturally recognized areas** serve as **symbols of ""true"" local identity**.
  * The **exclusion of villages with dividends** suggests a **social or cultural distinction** between ""true locals"" and others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses **historically and socially recognized territorial boundaries** to define ""local Guangzhou"".
  * The author implicitly uses **historical and cultural labels** to affirm the legitimacy of these boundaries.
  * The author makes a distinction between **those within the core area** and **those outside it**, especially in terms of identity and economic status (dividends).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they define the ""true"" Guangzhou based on long-accumulated social and historical recognition.
  * The author also uses **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as they distinguish between ""true locals"" and others (e.g., villages with dividends), implying a hierarchy of local identity based on economic status and social rootedness.

**Step 6: Output Result**

边个话你知老广就有分红，有分红都是村镇的，老广是住市区的,"**
RL1"," * The author is challenging a stereotype or misconception that being a ""老广"" (a term for someone originally from Guangzhou or Canton) inherently means receiving dividends. The author clarifies that those who receive dividends are typically from rural or village areas, while ""老广"" refers to those living in the urban area (市区).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""分红"" (dividends), ""村镇的"" (villages or towns), and ""市区的"" (urban area), which are potentially related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism) and **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is distinguishing between different types of people who are considered ""老广"" and is using **residence in the urban area** as a defining characteristic of true ""老广"" identity. The reference to ""分红"" is used to **contrast** with the urban-based ""老广"" identity and to **reject** the idea that receiving dividends is a defining feature of being a local.
  * The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **residence in the urban area** is a more legitimate or conventional marker of being a ""true local"" than being from a rural area with dividends.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **urban vs. rural residency** as a key criterion to define ""老广"", which aligns with **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  * The author **rejects** the idea that receiving dividends is a legitimate marker of local identity, so **RL6** is not endorsed and thus should not be annotated.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that ""老广"" is defined by **living in the urban area**, which reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**. This implies a **mental map** or **historically accepted boundary** between urban and rural residents in defining who is a ""true local"".

**Output:**

我是爷爷南下干部过来的，虽然白话习惯都一样，但内心里没有归属感,RL3," * The author is reflecting on their personal background as a descendant of a ""southward-moving cadre"" (a historical term for officials sent from northern China to southern regions for administrative purposes), and although they have adopted the local customs and language (白话, which refers to Cantonese or southern Chinese dialects), they express a lack of inner sense of belonging. The core intent is to convey that despite external cultural and linguistic adaptation, the author still feels disconnected from the local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions being the descendant of a ""southward-moving cadre"" (historical background of family).
  * They mention adopting the local language and customs (""白话习惯都一样"").
  * They express a lack of inner sense of belonging (""没有归属感"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of being a descendant of a ""southward-moving cadre"" is used to explain the author's historical and familial connection to the region, which is relevant to RL3.
  * The adoption of local language and customs is contrasted with the lack of inner belonging, implying that such cultural assimilation is not sufficient to establish a ""local"" identity in the author's view.
  * The lack of inner sense of belonging suggests a distinction between those who are ""truly local"" and those who are not, which implies a standard of identity rootedness.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implies that being born and raised in the region (RL3) is necessary for a genuine sense of local identity, and that even if one adopts local customs and language, it may not be enough to feel a true sense of belonging.
  * The author is not using administrative, linguistic, or economic criteria to define local identity, but is emphasizing the historical and generational rootedness of one's family in the region.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's emphasis on being a descendant of a ""southward-moving cadre"" and the lack of inner belonging supports the RL3 category, which is about family historical rootedness and individual growth history.
  * The author seems to endorse the idea that being born and raised in the region (or having multi-generational roots) is essential for a true sense of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3"
是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗，反正你又没分红,"**
RL6"," - The author is questioning the relevance of being a ""local person"" by suggesting that it has no practical significance for the listener since they do not benefit from it (e.g., not receiving dividends). The author implies that the value or legitimacy of being a ""local"" is tied to tangible economic benefits.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase ""分红"" (dividends) is a key element that relates to economic benefits or ownership in a community.
  - The question ""是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗"" (Does it make any essential difference to you whether someone is a local or not?) implies that the author is challenging the importance of being a ""local person"" if it does not lead to economic gains.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the idea of **dividends** to question the value of local identity. The implication is that being a local is only meaningful if it brings economic advantages.
  - The author is **implicitly rejecting** the idea that local identity has intrinsic value without material benefits.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **using economic benefits (dividends)** as a criterion to judge whether local identity is meaningful.
  - This aligns with **RL6**, which focuses on economic status or ownership as a basis for defining or evaluating local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implies that being a local is only significant if it brings economic advantages like dividends. This reflects a **RL6** logic where economic status or ownership is used to define or evaluate the authenticity or value of local identity.

**Output:**

想是就是，看自己的归属感,**," * The author is expressing a **subjective and personal view** on the concept of being ""local"", suggesting that it is largely based on **one's own sense of belonging or emotional connection** to a place.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) is central and potentially relates to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** or **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, but more likely to RL1 due to its emotional and cognitive nature.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is suggesting that whether someone is considered ""local"" is not based on objective criteria but rather on **subjective emotional attachment or perceived belonging**.
  * This implies that the **author resists rigid definitions** of local identity and instead emphasizes **individual perception and emotional connection** as the basis.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria explicitly (e.g., administrative status, historical rootedness, cultural traits, etc.).
  * The statement is **not defining ""local identity"" through any of the RL criteria** but rather **rejecting or de-emphasizing objective criteria** in favor of a **subjective, emotional basis**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) is a **subjective emotional criterion**, which may loosely connect to **RL1**, but only in a **very general and indirect way**.
  * However, the **author is not using it to define or evaluate ""local identity"" in the traditional or conventional sense**, but rather to suggest that the definition is **subjective and fluid**.
  * Therefore, **none of the RL categories are explicitly or strongly endorsed** in a way that aligns with the author's core argument.

**Output:**"
算啦，是不是本地的重要吗？ 现在粤语都没人讲了，分红也只有村民有,"RL4, RL6"," * The author is questioning the importance of being ""local"" and suggests that traditional markers of local identity (like speaking the local dialect or receiving community dividends) are becoming irrelevant or exclusive.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""粤语都没人讲了"" (Cantonese is no longer spoken) → potentially relates to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  * ""分红也只有村民有"" (dividends are only for villagers) → potentially relates to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author implies that speaking Cantonese (a traditional cultural marker) is no longer a distinguishing factor for being ""local"".
  * The mention of dividends being exclusive to villagers reflects a sense of exclusion and is used to question the relevance of traditional definitions of ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not endorsing** the traditional criteria for defining ""local identity"" (i.e., dialect and community dividends), but rather **highlighting their irrelevance or exclusivity**.
  * The author's core argument is to **question the importance of being ""local""**, suggesting that the traditional markers are no longer meaningful or inclusive.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL4** is relevant because the author mentions Cantonese, a cultural-linguistic marker.
  * **RL6** is relevant because the author refers to dividends, a marker of economic and social rootedness.
  * However, the author is **not endorsing** these as criteria for defining ""local identity"", but rather **challenging their relevance**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL4, RL6"

RL6"," * The author is suggesting that whether someone receives **dividends** is a **key indicator** of whether they are considered a **local** or not, particularly in a context where **dividends** may be tied to **local ownership, community rights, or economic participation**. The implication is that **dividend receipt** is a **criterion** for being recognized as a **""local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase **“分红” (dividends)** appears to be central to the author’s logic.
  * The author is linking **dividend receipt** to **local identity**, implying that **those who receive dividends are more likely to be considered local**, while those who do not are **less likely to be**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The **dividend receipt** is being used as a **symbol of local rootedness or entitlement**, likely in the context of **community ownership or local economic participation**.
  * The author’s **attitude** is **neutral but evaluative**, suggesting that **dividend receipt is a relevant indicator** of local status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **dividend receipt is a relevant indicator** of local identity.
  * This is **consistent with RL6**, which includes **community dividends** as a **basis for judging local identity or status**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that **receiving dividends is a relevant indicator** of whether someone is considered a **local**, or has a **legitimate stake in the local community**.

They were raised with a strong self-identification as a native of Guangzhou but begin to doubt it when confronted by a local villager who claims to be a ""true native."" The author questions the legitimacy of their own local identity based on family history and administrative criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""广州土生土长的家族第三代"" (third generation born and raised in Guangzhou) – implies family historical rootedness.
  - ""自我认同喺广州本地土著"" (self-identify as a native of Guangzhou) – implies self-identification with local identity.
  - ""有祠堂的本地村民"" (local villagers with ancestral halls) – implies cultural and historical rootedness.
  - ""户口本依然显示乡下地名而唔喺广州"" (the household registration still shows a rural hometown name, not Guangzhou) – administrative legitimacy.
  - The contrast between family history and administrative registration.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author initially defines their local identity through **family historical rootedness** (being third generation in Guangzhou).
  - They are challenged by another local who is also rooted but has **cultural markers (祠堂)** and **administrative legitimacy (户口)** as a native.
  - The author's **self-identification** is shaken, implying that **administrative legitimacy and cultural rootedness** are being used as **legitimating criteria** for ""local identity"" in the local community's view.
  - The author **implicitly accepts** the legitimacy of these criteria by expressing a sense of ""无力反驳"" (powerless to refute), suggesting that these are socially accepted standards for judging local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author uses the fact of being a third generation born and raised in Guangzhou to claim local identity.
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – The author is challenged by the fact that their household registration still shows a rural hometown, not Guangzhou.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The concept of being a ""true native"" is implicitly tied to a socially accepted understanding of who counts as a local, which includes both family history and administrative legitimacy.
  - The author **does not explicitly reject** these criteria and instead shows **implicit acceptance** by feeling unable to refute them.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's self-identification as a local is based on **RL3**, but they are challenged by **RL2** and **RL1** criteria that the local community implicitly uses to define ""true locals.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我妈果边是世代广州人"" – references family historical rootedness.
  * ""地主被没收财产，变成疍家人了"" – implies a shift in social and economic status, possibly affecting local identity.
  * ""无地唔系村民"" – suggests that ownership of land is a key factor in being recognized as a local or villager.
  * ""我爷在广州出世"" – again, references family historical rootedness.
  * ""感我系广州人吗？"" – the author's self-identification with Guangzhou.

The core intent is to determine whether someone is a **""true local""** or has a **stable and influential local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""祠堂"" (clan hall) and ""地"" (land) are symbolic of historical settlement and community roots.

这么说吧，广州前段时间村里分分红，你家有吗？没就不算,"**
RL6"," * The author is using the context of a recent village dividend distribution in Guangzhou to suggest a standard for judging whether someone is a ""local"" or not. The core intent is to imply that **owning a share in local community resources** is a criterion for being considered a ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “村里分分红” (village dividend), which points to a form of community resource ownership or connection. The rhetorical question “你家有吗？没就不算” (Do you have any at home? If not, then you don’t count) indicates that the author is using this as a standard to determine inclusion or exclusion in the ""local"" group.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of village dividends and the rhetorical question serve to **establish a criterion for judging local identity** based on whether someone is entitled to or benefits from community resources. The author implicitly endorses this as a standard to determine if someone is a ""real local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using the **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism** (e.g., ownership in community dividends) as a standard to judge whether someone counts as a ""local"". This is an implicit endorsement.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The RL category that best fits is **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as the author is using the ownership of community dividends to judge whether someone is a ""local"". This aligns with the definition of RL6, which includes **control over community resources (e.g., village/community dividends)** as a criterion for evaluating local identity.

**Output:**
RL6"
我住德政中，无村无分红,"RL3, RL6"," * The author is expressing a sense of exclusion from the local community, particularly in terms of lacking the status or benefits traditionally associated with being a local resident. The phrase “无村无分红” (“no village, no dividends”) suggests that the author is not part of a community that has a collective or traditional structure (like a village) and therefore does not receive associated economic benefits.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase “无村” hints at a **historical or social structure** (possibly rural or village-based) that is important for defining local identity.
  * The phrase “分红” refers to **economic benefits or ownership**, which is a key component of RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * “无村” implies that the author is not part of a traditional local community structure (possibly a village or neighborhood with a long-standing social identity), which is used by the author to contrast their own identity status with those who are.
  * “无分红” suggests that the author is not part of a community that benefits from shared economic resources, and this is used to **highlight a lack of rootedness or belonging** in the local area.
  * Both phrases together indicate that the author is **implicitly defining ""local identity""** in terms of **historical belonging and economic participation**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly defines ""local identity""** as being tied to **historical rootedness** (village membership) and **economic participation** (dividends), which are both **endangered or absent** in the author’s case.
  * These are **used to evaluate or define the author’s own status** in the local community.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase “无村” relates to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**, as it implies a lack of connection to a traditional or historical local community.
  * The phrase “无分红” relates to **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**, as it indicates a lack of economic integration or ownership in the local area, which is often associated with being a ""real local.""
  * The author is **implicitly defining ""local identity""** in terms of **historical belonging and economic participation**, both of which are **lacking in their own case**.

They are challenging the legitimacy of defining ""local identity"" solely based on rural background or economic benefits from local land ownership. The author presents a counterexample: their company supervisor, who is a native Guangzhou person but lives near the city center and has no land dividends.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长的广州人"" (native Guangzhou person) — potentially related to RL3.
  - ""一直住在靠近市区"" (has always lived near the city center) — potentially related to RL1 or RL5.
  - ""家里也没有分红"" (no land dividends at home) — potentially related to RL6.
  - Questioning whether rural background is the only criterion — potentially related to RL1, RL6, or RL2.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **explicitly challenging** a definition of ""local identity"" that is **based on rural roots or economic benefits from land**.
  - By presenting a native Guangzhou person who lives in the city and has no land-related income, the author is **arguing against** the idea that **economic or social rootedness (RL6)** or **specific residential location (RL1)** is the sole or necessary condition for being considered a ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the criteria implied in RL6 (land-based economic benefits) or RL1 (specific territorial boundaries).
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse** any specific RL criteria for defining ""local identity"" — rather, they are **challenging** narrow definitions.
  - However, by presenting a person who is considered a ""true local"" despite not fitting the rural/land-based criteria, the author **implicitly supports** the idea that **being born and raised in the city (RL3)** is a valid basis for ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **challenging** definitions of ""local identity"" based on rural background (RL1), economic rootedness (RL6), and land-based status (RL6).
  - The author **implicitly supports** the idea that **being born and raised in the city** (RL3) is sufficient for being considered a ""local.""

The term ""阴公"" may refer to ancestral or spiritual matters. The core intent seems to be commenting on the **lack of tangible local identity benefits**, particularly in terms of economic or social advantages, despite the presence of traditional or cultural markers of locality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""祠堂"" and ""族谱"" suggest **cultural and historical rootedness**.
  * ""没分红"" points to **lack of economic or social resource control**.
  * ""阴公"" implies **ancestral or spiritual ties**, possibly linked to **historical rootedness**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **comparing the presence of cultural heritage (祠堂, 族谱) with the absence of economic benefit (分红)**. This suggests a **critique or observation** that being part of a local community with historical ties (祠堂, 族谱) does not necessarily grant one the **material or social privileges** (分红) typically associated with being a ""rooted local.""
  * The author may be **implicitly questioning the legitimacy or value of local identity** if it does not translate into real-world benefits.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **uses cultural and historical rootedness** (祠堂, 族谱) to define a form of local identity.
  * The author also **uses economic status and resource control** (分红) to evaluate the **authenticity or value of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The mention of ""祠堂"" and ""族谱"" aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it refers to the cultural and historical ties to a local area.
  * The reference to ""没分红"" aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as it implies that being a ""local"" without economic benefits (such as dividends from community resources) does not equate to a stable or influential local identity.

They assert their own identity as a ""new local"" based on generational roots in the area (their grandparents' generation), while rejecting any strong connection to the rural origins of their ancestors. The author clearly identifies themselves as a ""local"" of Foshan and emphasizes this identity over any ancestral rural background.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""严格来说不算正宗本土本地人"" → implies the existence of a conventional definition of ""authentic local"".
  - ""我爷奶那代已经在佛山"" → refers to generational history and family rootedness.
  - ""清明会翻乡下拜山"" → suggests ancestral traditions but also a weakening connection to rural origins.
  - ""乡下已经无亲戚 大家都出晒来"" → indicates a shift in family settlement and loss of rural ties.
  - ""我对乡下无归属感"" → rejects rural identity.
  - ""我是佛山人佛山本地独生女"" → affirms current local identity in Foshan.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author contrasts their own identity with the conventional notion of ""authentic local"", suggesting a new form of local identity based on generational settlement.
  - The generational settlement (grandparents’ generation) is used to justify their claim to being a local.
  - The rejection of rural ties is central to their self-identification as a ""Foshan local"", not a rural descendant.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author explicitly uses **generational settlement** (grandparents’ generation) to justify their local identity.
  - The author **rejects rural ties** and instead **affirms Foshan as their local identity**, indicating a shift in how local identity is constructed in the context of urbanization and migration.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's emphasis on their grandparents' settlement in Foshan falls under **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - The author's rejection of rural ties and assertion of Foshan as their true local identity implies an evolving **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they redefine what counts as ""local"" in a modern, urban context.

The author emphasizes **cultural identity and internal self-identification** as the core criteria for being a local, rather than ancestry, birthplace, or linguistic background.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""你心里认为广州是你老家"" (You believe Guangzhou is your hometown in your heart) – suggests internal self-identification.
  - ""文化上认同"" (Cultural identification) – directly points to cultural identity.
  - ""当别人问你老家哪里的，你首先想到广州"" (When asked where your hometown is, you first think of Guangzhou) – reflects internal cultural anchoring.
  - ""爷爷哪里人，每年还回爷爷老家，在家里说爷爷老家的家乡话"" (Grandfather is from somewhere else, returns there every year, speaks the dialect of his hometown at home) – implies that ancestry and language are not sufficient to be a local.
  - ""本地人是打心底里认同本地文化饮食的"" (Locals deeply identify with the local culture and food) – reinforces cultural and emotional identification.
  - ""不会有自己是哪里人的疑惑"" (They will not have doubts about where they are from) – implies a clear, unambiguous self-identification as local.
  - ""你还有疑惑，可能还不属于本地人"" (If you still have doubts, you may not be a local) – defines the boundary of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **cultural identification and internal self-identification** as the central criteria for being a local, contrasting it with **ancestry, language, and birthplace**.
  - The author is **explicitly rejecting** the idea that being born in a place, having a local grandfather, or speaking a local dialect is sufficient for being a local.
  - The author emphasizes **internal cultural belonging and certainty in identity** as the key markers of being a ""local person.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses** **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** and **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  - The author **rejects** using ancestry, birthplace, or language alone as defining criteria, which would fall under **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** and **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** if not framed around internal identification.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is triggered by the author's emphasis on a **mental map of identity**, where one's self-perception and emotional anchoring to the place is key to being a local.
  - **RL4** is also relevant, as the author discusses **cultural and linguistic identification**, but only as part of a **deep internalized cultural belonging**, not as a surface-level linguistic trait.

These are presented as the **definitive criteria** for being a local, implying that **only those with deep social and economic roots in the area** can be considered ""true locals.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""有分红"" (having dividends): Suggests involvement in community economic structures (e.g., village or community dividends).
  - ""有祠堂"" (having ancestral temples): Implies long-standing family or ancestral presence in the area.
  - ""有地"" (owning land): Indicates property ownership, a marker of deep-rootedness and economic stake in the region.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as the **definitive standards** for judging who is a ""local person.""
  - They are **used collectively** to define the **authenticity and legitimacy** of local identity, particularly in terms of **historical, social, and economic embeddedness** in the area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **not merely describing** these elements but is using them as **standards to judge local identity**.
  - These are **clearly used to define who counts as a local**, not just to describe social phenomena or personal preferences.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""租收"" (rental income) and ""分红"" (dividend) are both economic indicators that may be linked to **RL6**, as they relate to **economic status symbolism** and **depth of social roots** in a local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These terms are not used to define or evaluate ""local identity"" per se, but rather to assess **financial returns or benefits** potentially tied to property ownership or investment.
  * There is **no explicit or implicit suggestion** that these economic indicators are used by the author to judge whether someone is a ""local"" or to evaluate the legitimacy or scope of a local area.
  * The author is **focused on personal financial gain**, not on the construction or evaluation of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * Although the terms could be associated with RL6, they are **not used in the context of defining or evaluating local identity**.
  * The author is not asserting that **rental income or dividends are criteria for being a local person** or for judging a region’s local value.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * No RL category is clearly and directly used to define or evaluate ""local identity"" in this text.
  * The author is not expressing a viewpoint about **who is a local**, **how local identity is defined**, or **how a region should be evaluated** based on these economic indicators.

**Output:**"
有分红就算吧,RL6," * The author is expressing a dismissive or resigned attitude toward a certain group of people who may have economic privileges or benefits (e.g., those who receive dividends). There is an implication that the author considers this group to be ""local"" in some way, but in a way that is not fully aligned with their own identity or values.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""有分红"" (has dividends) refers to a specific economic benefit.
  * This may imply a deeper connection to the local area, such as owning property or being part of a community with shared economic interests.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the idea of receiving dividends as a marker of being part of the local community.
  * The tone is dismissive, suggesting that the author sees this as a superficial or insufficient criterion for being considered a ""real"" local.
  * This implies that the author is contrasting their own understanding of ""local identity"" with the one associated with those who receive dividends.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is implicitly suggesting that receiving dividends is one way to be considered ""local"", but in a way that is not fully accepted or endorsed by them.
  * The author's core argument is not about rejecting this criterion outright, but rather using it as a point of contrast to their own identity or understanding of localness.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""有分红"" (has dividends) is a reference to a specific economic benefit, which is a key element of RL6.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""唔识得讲白话"" (can't speak Cantonese) — relates to language and cultural familiarity.
  * ""本地捞"" — implies outsider status or non-local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The statement directly links the **ability to speak the local dialect** with **being considered a local**. The phrase ""你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞"" implies that **language is a marker of inclusion or exclusion from the local group**.
  * The author uses this to **define who is not considered a local**, and by implication, who is.

  - The author mentions ""佛山本地人"" (local Foshan person), ""有分红"" (has dividends), ""有族谱"" (has family records), ""祠堂几百年历史"" (ancestral hall with hundreds of years of history), and ""户口"" (hukou). These suggest connections to family history, social roots, and administrative legitimacy.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is exploring the boundaries of ""local identity"" by contrasting different cases (son with non-local hukou vs. daughter with local hukou), and is evaluating whether administrative legitimacy (hukou) or historical/social roots (dividends, family records, ancestral hall) are more important in defining who is a ""local"".
  - The author seems to be questioning whether administrative legitimacy (RL2) or family historical rootedness (RL3) is the more valid standard.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is using **both** administrative legitimacy (RL2) and family historical rootedness (RL3) as criteria to define who is a ""local"".
  - The author is not explicitly opposing either criterion but is **questioning the relative validity** of each in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The core intent is to explain how their **family background and settlement history** influence their sense of belonging or exclusion in the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author's grandfather came from Dongguan and settled in Guangzhou during the Anti-Japanese War.
  - The mother is from a Guangzhou rural area.
  - The author's household registration (hukou) follows the mother and has remained in the village.
  - The author receives village dividends.
  - Despite this, the author is considered an ""outsider"" (外姓人) in the village due to not being of the same surname.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - Tracing the **family's historical settlement** in Guangzhou is used to explain the author's connection to the city.
  - The **mother's rural Guangzhou origin and the author's hukou** are presented as **legitimizing factors** for being considered local or entitled to certain local rights (e.g., village dividends).
  - However, the author is still considered an outsider in the village due to being of a different surname, which suggests that **family lineage and surname are also criteria for inclusion** in local social identity.
  - The author is **implicitly questioning their own local identity** and the criteria by which it is judged.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author uses **family settlement history** and **mother's origin** to argue for their connection to Guangzhou.
  - The **hukou system** is presented as a factor in determining local rights (e.g., receiving village dividends).
  - The **surname-based social exclusion** in the village is described, suggesting it is a **local cultural norm** that affects identity and belonging.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author emphasizes the family's historical settlement in Guangzhou and their mother's rural Guangzhou origin to define their connection to the region.
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – The author's hukou and the mother's hukou are described as important for receiving village dividends, indicating administrative legitimacy as a factor in local identity.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author is considered an ""outsider"" (外姓人) in the village due to surname, which reflects a **locally conventional social identity** based on lineage and belonging.

听讲话无祠堂，非农户口，都有分红,"**
RL6"," * The text is brief but carries a clear evaluative tone. The author appears to be asserting that even though someone may not be from a local family with a祠堂 (ancestral hall, a symbol of deep-rooted local heritage), and even if they are a non-agricultural户口 (urban household registration), they can still be considered part of the local community due to the fact that they receive dividends (possibly from land or community development). This suggests the author is redefining or challenging traditional criteria of ""local identity"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""祠堂"" — implies a historical or cultural rootedness in the area.
  * ""非农户口"" — refers to administrative legitimacy (户口).
  * ""都有分红"" — suggests economic ties or community asset ownership, which could relate to social roots and economic status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is contrasting traditional markers of local identity (祠堂, 农户口) with the modern criterion of receiving dividends.
  * The author implicitly argues that receiving dividends is a more relevant or legitimate indicator of being part of the local community than traditional or administrative criteria.
  * The author’s attitude is dismissive or downplays the importance of traditional or administrative criteria, while endorsing the economic connection (分红) as a valid basis for being considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * RL1 is mentioned (祠堂), but it is not endorsed by the author — it is contrasted with the idea that someone can still be local without it.
  * RL2 is mentioned (户口), but it is not endorsed by the author — the author emphasizes that even with a non-agricultural户口, one can still be local.
  * RL6 is endorsed — the author emphasizes the economic connection (分红) as a basis for being considered local, which aligns with the RL6 criteria of economic status or asset ownership in the local area as a marker of identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that being considered a ""local"" is not necessarily dependent on traditional cultural or administrative markers (祠堂, 农户口), but can be based on economic participation in the community (分红). This aligns with RL6, as it emphasizes economic ties and ownership as a criterion for local identity.

**Output:**

RL1, RL2"," * The author is emphasizing that **certain traditional village privileges (like dividends) are only available to those with local household registration (hukou)**, and that **the historical core of Guangzhou city has long ceased to have villages**, implying that **only those with a long-standing administrative or historical connection to the area can be considered ""local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎"" — suggests that **household registration (hukou)** determines eligibility for local benefits (dividends).
  * ""广州旧中心城区（清朝时起的城墙位置内）几百年前就无村噶啦"" — implies that the **historical and administrative boundaries of the old city center** are being referenced, and that **villages no longer exist there**, which could be used to distinguish who has a historical connection to the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of **hukou** and **dividends** serves to **establish administrative legitimacy** as a criterion for being considered a local or being entitled to local benefits.
  * The reference to **historical administrative boundaries** and the **absence of villages** in the old city center supports a **conventional territorial identity**, implying that the area has a distinct identity from the surrounding regions and that only those with historical ties to it are ""true locals"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** by using **hukou** as a basis for defining who is entitled to local benefits.
  * The author also implicitly conveys **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** by referencing **historical boundaries** and the **absence of villages** to reinforce the idea of a **distinct local identity** tied to a specific historical and administrative area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **administrative household registration (RL2)** as a key criterion to determine who is entitled to local benefits (dividends), and **historical and territorial boundaries (RL1)** to define the core area of the city and who might be considered to have a legitimate historical connection to it.

RL1, RL3, RL6"," * The author is commenting on a personal experience or observation regarding the differences in **local identity and economic benefits** (dividends) between different regions. The core intent is to express surprise or contrast in how people from different local areas (e.g., Yuexiu, Liwan, Panyu) are treated in terms of **entitlement to community dividends**, implying that being a ""local"" is tied to **historical status (farmer vs. resident) and economic inclusion**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""全部农转居"" (all converted from farmers to residents) – suggests a **historical transformation of identity**.
  * ""仲有分红"" (still have dividends) – implies **economic benefits tied to local identity**.
  * ""距系越秀定荔湾了"" (he is from Yuexiu or Liwan) – implies **regional affiliation and local identity**.
  * ""因为我地番禺是农户先有分红"" (because in Panyu, only farmers get dividends) – shows **local identity and economic status are linked**, and the author is **comparing their own region's standards** to others.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the **historical status of being a farmer** as a criterion for whether someone is entitled to local benefits (dividends), indicating that **local identity is tied to historical rootedness** (RL3).
  * The author also uses **regional affiliation (Yuexiu, Liwan, Panyu)** as a way to distinguish between different groups of ""locals"", and how they are treated differently in terms of **benefits and rights**, implying a **regional identity system** (RL1).
  * The **economic status** (dividends) is used as a **marker of legitimacy or depth of local identity**, which is a key element of RL6.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **endorses** the idea that being a **historical farmer** is a key to receiving local benefits, indicating **family historical rootedness** (RL3).
  * The author **implies a regional identity system**, where different areas have different standards for what constitutes a ""local"" and what rights/benefits they receive, which is **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1).
  * The author **uses economic benefits (dividends)** as a **symbol of local status**, which is part of **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism** (RL6).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **historical status as a farmer**, **regional affiliation**, and **economic benefits (dividends)** as criteria to define who is a ""local"" and who is entitled to local rights. These are **explicitly or implicitly endorsed** and serve the author’s core argument of **contrasting different local identity systems**.

我家旧唐楼系大东门附近，幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已。分红真系无。有族谱，但系基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦,RL3," * The author is describing their personal background and the history of their family in a specific local area. They emphasize that they have lived there since early childhood and that their family has historical roots in the area, but they also clarify that their family no longer resides in China and that they do not benefit from local economic structures like property dividends.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已"" – indicates early settlement and lifelong connection to the local area.
  * ""有族谱"" – suggests a family historical connection to the local area.
  * ""但系基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦"" – implies that the family's current presence in the area is not actual, indicating a break from the place.
  * ""分红真系无"" – indicates no economic stake or ownership in the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is subtly addressing what it means to be considered a ""local person"" by pointing out that although their family has a historical connection to the area (RL3), they no longer live there and do not benefit from it economically (contrasting with RL6).
  * The mention of early settlement supports a traditional view of local identity based on historical rootedness, but the lack of current economic ties suggests a critique or clarification of what it means to be a ""real local"" in modern terms.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly endorses RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) as a criterion for defining ""local identity"", since they emphasize that they were raised in the area from an early age.
  * However, they also clarify that their family is no longer in China, suggesting that historical rootedness alone may not be sufficient to define ""local identity"" in the present.
  * The lack of economic ties (RL6) is mentioned but is not used to define ""local identity"" in a way that the author endorses.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses their own early settlement and childhood history in the area to imply that they have a legitimate claim to being considered a ""local"". However, they also clarify that this is not enough if the person is no longer physically or economically connected to the place. This suggests a nuanced view of local identity that includes historical rootedness but also implies that presence and economic ties matter.

我都系甘葛情况，我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著,RL3," - The author is reflecting on their own identity and that of their father, acknowledging a connection to ""old Guangzhou people"" (""老西关系广州人"") but expressing doubt about whether they are ""natives"" (""土著""). This suggests a self-reflective stance on what it means to be a ""local"" in Guangzhou, based on generational or historical ties.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老西关系广州人"" (old Guangzhou people with local connections)
  - ""老豆"" (father)
  - ""土著"" (native)
  - The author's own self-identification and that of their father as being ""old Guangzhou people"" but not ""natives""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The term ""老西关系广州人"" implies a generational or historical connection to the city, possibly indicating a family with deep roots in Guangzhou.
  - The author questions whether this generational or relational connection is enough to be considered a ""native"", suggesting a distinction between being a long-time local and being a true ""native"" or ""original inhabitant"".
  - This indicates a **generational or family-based criterion** for local identity, and a **self-reflective evaluation** of whether such a criterion is sufficient.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author seems to **endorse** the idea that being part of ""old Guangzhou people"" with family ties is a valid form of local identity, but **questions** whether it equates to being a ""native"" or ""original inhabitant"".
  - This reflects a **generational or family-based rootedness** in the city, and a **self-reflective evaluation** of its legitimacy in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **generational or family-based rootedness** (""老豆"", ""老西关系广州人"") to define their local identity, which aligns with **RL3**.
  - The author also **self-reflectively questions** whether this is enough to be considered a ""native"", which may suggest an **implicit critique or reconsideration** of the criteria for local identity, but the **primary endorsed criteria** remain the generational ties.

RL4"," * The author is discussing the criteria for being considered a ""local person"" and argues that it depends on whether one has integrated into the local culture. They contrast their own situation with the concept of ""local people"", noting that even though they have formed a community with others from the same hometown (with a village, ancestral hall, and ancestral house), they still maintain distinct cultural practices and language. The author concludes that because they have not fully integrated into the local culture, they do not consider themselves local people.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions: 
    - Cultural practices (customs during festivals)
    - Language (local dialect vs. hometown dialect)
    - Community organization (spontaneously formed village, ancestral hall, ancestral house)
    - Historical migration (great-grandparents moved to the current city)
    - Cultural identity markers (calling local people ""you locals"", using local language but not with fellow villagers)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **cultural practices**, **language**, and **cultural identity markers** as criteria to determine whether one is considered a ""local person"". The author **does not consider administrative or historical rootedness (e.g., family history in the area)** as sufficient for being considered local. The author **explicitly endorses cultural integration as the key standard** for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **endorses** cultural integration as a defining criterion for local identity.
  * The author **rejects** the idea that having a village or ancestral house is sufficient for being considered local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's argument is centered on **cultural integration** as the defining standard for local identity. This includes **language use, participation in local customs, and cultural identity markers**.
  * This matches **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author emphasizes language and cultural practices as the basis for determining whether someone is ""local"" or not.

These elements suggest a strong local identity rooted in heritage and cultural practice.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""籍贯广州"" (hometown is Guangzhou) – potentially RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
  * ""广州村民"" (Guangzhou villagers) – potentially RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  * ""清明去白云山上拜"" (Go to Baiyun Mountain for Qingming to pay respects) – potentially RL1 or RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  * ""几代祖先都在山上"" (Ancestors for several generations are buried there) – potentially RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness).
  * ""家庭所有成员粤语完全不带口音"" (All family members speak Cantonese without any accent) – potentially RL4.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using these descriptions to **establish their own legitimacy and depth of connection to Guangzhou**. The ancestral burial site and language use are **strong indicators of cultural and familial rootedness**. The mention of not using a public cemetery and speaking standard Cantonese without an accent **highlights a traditional and authentic local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **explicitly using** the location of ancestral graves and language as **criteria for being a ""true local""**. These are **not just descriptions but indicators of identity**.
  * The reference to being a ""Guangzhou villager"" and ancestral ties to Baiyun Mountain also function as **markers of local identity**.
  * There is **no indication** that the author is resisting any of these criteria; rather, they are **presented as defining features of being a ""local.""**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is **explicitly using family historical rootedness (RL3)** and **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** to define their own ""local"" identity.
  * The **ancestral burial on Baiyun Mountain** and **generational ties** are key to **RL3**.
  * The **use of standard Cantonese without an accent** is a key indicator of **RL4**.
  * The mention of ""Guangzhou villagers"" and ancestral ties to a specific location also contributes to **RL1**, as it reflects **regional identity and a socially conventional understanding of who is considered ""local.""**

They mention their mother's village with a clan hall, their father's overseas Chinese background, and their own birth and upbringing in Guangzhou, yet they feel they can only consider themselves a ""half Guangzhou person."" The core intent is to explore and define their sense of belonging to the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的"" – implies ancestral ties and village-based rootedness.
  * ""爸爸是潮汕归侨"" – indicates the father's migration history and non-local origin.
  * ""我广州土生土长"" – suggests personal growth history in the city.
  * ""我觉得自己只是半个广州人"" – reflects the author's own evaluation of their ""local identity"" as incomplete or partial.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses their mother's village with a clan hall as a marker of local rootedness (RL3).
  * The father's background as a returnee from overseas (潮汕归侨) introduces a contrast with traditional local identity (not RL3, but relevant to the author's self-perception).
  * The author's personal history of being born and raised in Guangzhou (RL3) is presented as a factor in their local identity.
  * The final statement expresses the author's self-evaluation of their local identity as incomplete, likely due to the mixed background of their parents.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses their **growth history in Guangzhou** as a basis for their local identity.
  * The author also implies that **family historical rootedness (mother's village with a clan hall)** contributes to the legitimacy of local identity.
  * The father's background is mentioned but not used as a criterion for defining local identity, rather it is a contrast or complicating factor.
  * The author's own self-evaluation is not based on other RL elements like administrative boundaries or economic status.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's self-perception of being ""half a Guangzhou person"" is influenced by **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  * The author explicitly references their **growth history in Guangzhou** and their **mother's family's historical rootedness** as relevant to their local identity.

The author implies that speaking with a local accent is a legitimate and expected part of being a local.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""我广州话有乡音"" (I speak Cantonese with a local accent), and ""去祠堂都系讲乡音"" (people at the ancestral temple also speak with a local accent). These are related to language and regional speech patterns.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the presence of a local accent (""乡音"") as a **defining characteristic** of being a ""local"" in Guangzhou. The mention of the ancestral temple is used to reinforce that the local accent is a **norm and marker of authenticity** in the local community.
  * The author is **affirming** that having a local accent is not a sign of being an outsider, but rather a **core part of being a ""real"" local**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using **language and accent** as a criterion for defining who is a ""local"". This is a **strongly endorsed** and **defensive** position.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This matches **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author uses the **local accent and language** as a standard to affirm their own and others' local identity. The author implies that speaking with a local accent is a **legitimate and expected sign of being a local**.

**Output:** RL4"

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""好几代在这边"" (multiple generations here), ""讲粤语"" (speaking Cantonese), and ""我是番禺的"" (I am from Panyu). These relate to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) and RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author acknowledges their family's long-standing presence and use of the local language, but still feels excluded from the ""true local"" identity due to their Panyu origin. This implies that both historical rootedness and cultural-linguistic recognition are important, but are not sufficient on their own to be considered a ""true local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly accepts that being born and raised in the region (RL3) and speaking the local dialect (RL4) are part of the criteria for being a ""local"", but also implies that being from a historically distinct sub-region (Panyu) affects this identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's statement reflects that **both family history (RL3)** and **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** are used as part of the logic to define ""local identity"", but also shows that **regional sub-identity (RL1)** plays a role in determining whether someone is considered a ""true local"".

They express a belief that only a very small fraction of original Guangzhou people remained in the city, while the majority migrated overseas. The author is emphasizing that being a ""true local"" is defined by long-standing familial roots in the city and not by later migration or commercial presence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门"" – implies a historical territorial boundary.
  * ""我家没有祠堂"" – suggests a lack of ancestral or cultural roots in the city.
  * ""清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来"" – indicates a migration history and commercial activity.
  * ""广州土著大部分都走国外，留下来万中无一"" – implies that true locals are those who have remained in the city through generations.
  * ""美加香港南洋比广州更多广州土著"" – suggests that the actual population of true locals is now concentrated in overseas locations.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **historical territorial boundaries** to define what the original ""local"" area of Guangzhou was.
  * The **absence of a family ancestral hall (""祠堂"")** is used to imply a lack of deep family roots.
  * The **family's migration history and commercial activity** are used to contrast with those who have remained in the city.
  * The **geographic dispersal of ""true locals""** is used to emphasize the rarity and value of being a ""true local"" who has stayed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly endorsing **historical territorial boundaries** as a standard for defining ""local.""
  * The author is also using **family historical rootedness** to distinguish between true locals and those with migration history.
  * The **geographic dispersal** is used to emphasize the **rarity of true locals**, but not as a defining criterion itself.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that the definition of ""local"" in Guangzhou is tied to **historical territorial boundaries (RL1)** and **family historical rootedness (RL3)**. They imply that only those with deep generational ties to the city can be considered true locals, and that the city's core area historically was a specific geographic region.

  - The author also suggests that **those who fail to preserve traditional culture may be seen as having lost their ""local"" identity** and may be **left behind by the times**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** ""世代居住在广州"" (living in Guangzhou for generations), ""移居"" (migrated), ""保留广州语言文化饮食习惯"" (preserve Guangzhou language, culture, and eating habits).
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** ""广州语言"", ""白切鸡"", ""粤语歌"" (Cantonese language, white sliced chicken, Cantonese songs).
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Implicit in the idea of what constitutes ""more Guangzhou"" or ""more local"", based on cultural continuity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **explicitly using cultural continuity** (language, food, music) and **historical rootedness** (living in Guangzhou for generations) as **criteria to judge who is ""more local"" or ""more Guangzhou""**.
  - The author implies that **current residents who no longer practice traditional culture are not as ""local""**, even if they were born and raised there.
  - The author's **attitude is critical** toward people who have abandoned traditional culture, suggesting that **they are no longer fully ""local""** and are **left behind by the times**.

  - The author **endorses cultural preservation and historical rootedness** as valid criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **does not endorse current residents who have lost traditional traits**, implying that they no longer meet the criteria for being ""local"" in the author's view.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **uses RL3** (historical rootedness) and **RL4** (cultural-linguistic recognition) as **criteria for judging who is more ""local""**.

None"," * The author is reflecting on how people who have lived in a city for multiple generations may still not consider themselves as ""local people"" (in this case, ""Guangzhou people""). The author’s family has lived in Guangzhou for decades, speaks the local language, and has a strong connection to the city, yet they still do not identify as local. This suggests a deeper discussion about the criteria for defining ""local identity.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions the author’s grandparents coming to Guangzhou for work, the author’s parents growing up there, speaking Cantonese at home, and returning to the ancestral hometown only occasionally. These are all potentially relevant to RL3 and RL4.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the family's long-term presence in Guangzhou, language use, and upbringing as evidence of deep roots in the city.
  * However, the author notes that despite all this, the family still does not identify as ""Guangzhou people,"" suggesting that these factors are **not sufficient** for defining local identity in the author's view.
  * The author seems to be **implicitly critiquing** the idea that long-term residence, language, or upbringing are enough to claim local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not endorse** the idea that long-term family presence (RL3) or language (RL4) alone are sufficient for being considered a local.
  * The author is **not asserting any specific criteria** for local identity but is instead **highlighting the gap between lived experience and identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **does not explicitly endorse** any RL category as a defining standard for local identity. Instead, the author is **highlighting the limitations of existing criteria** (family history and language) in defining local identity. Since the task is to identify **criteria the author themselves endorse or strongly imply**, and the author does not clearly present or endorse any criteria for defining local identity, **no RL category is applicable**.

**Output:**
None"
广州本地人一般指老四区世居吧（老越秀、老荔湾、老东山、海珠）吧。因为好像我们这种，至少五代都在广州土生土长，有分红有地，最多都系叫广州客家人。,"RL1, RL3, RL6"," * The author is attempting to define who qualifies as a ""Guangzhou local"" by referencing long-standing settlement, generational heritage, and ownership of land or dividends. The author contrasts this with people like themselves who, though born and raised in Guangzhou for generations, are not considered ""true locals"" but rather ""Guangzhou Hakka.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""老四区世居"" (long-term residents of the four old districts), ""至少五代都在广州土生土长"" (at least five generations born and raised in Guangzhou), ""有分红有地"" (having land and dividends), ""最多都系叫广州客家人"" (at most, called Guangzhou Hakka).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These elements are used to **define the boundaries of ""local identity""** in Guangzhou, with the author **implicitly accepting** that being a ""local"" requires **generational rootedness** and **ownership or connection to local land or community resources**.
  * The author **rejects** their own identity as a ""true local,"" instead identifying as ""Guangzhou Hakka,"" suggesting that **ancestral origin** also plays a role in defining ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **endorses** the idea that being a ""local"" is tied to **long-term generational presence** and **ownership or connection to land/dividends**, and **implicitly accepts** that **ancestral background** may also influence local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3** is evident through the emphasis on generational rootedness (""至少五代都在广州土生土长"").
  * **RL6** is present in the mention of ""分红有地"" (dividends and land ownership), which reflects the economic and social rootedness in the local area.
  * **RL1** is also applicable as the author references a **historically and socially accepted regional identity** (""老四区世居"") that is used to distinguish who is considered a ""true local.""

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1, RL3, RL6"
讲白话？,N/A," * The phrase ""讲白话？"" is a question that can be interpreted as ""Speak plainly?"" or ""Talk in plain language?"" It is not a full statement but appears to be a prompt or challenge from the author, possibly indicating a desire for straightforward or unambiguous communication. There is **no clear definition of ""local identity""** or any criteria being proposed or implied here.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase is too brief and lacks specific content or context to identify any RL elements related to defining ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * There is no argument or definition of ""local identity"" present in the text to support or refute any RL criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * No RL criteria are relevant or endorsed by the author in this text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The text does not contain any content that can be matched to the RL framework. It is a minimal phrase that does not express a core argument or definition of ""local identity.""

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output:"
有分红就算,RL6," * The text is a short phrase: “有分红就算” (If there is a dividend, it counts). It implies a condition or a standard being accepted or used to define something, likely in the context of local identity or local status, based on the ownership or entitlement to a dividend.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase references **dividends**, which may relate to **community ownership, economic status, or social embeddedness**, potentially indicating **local economic participation or privilege**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author appears to be suggesting that **owning or receiving a dividend is enough to be considered part of the local community or to have a claim to local identity**.
  * This implies that **economic participation or benefit (e.g., dividends) is a criterion for being recognized as a ""local.""**

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **dividend ownership or entitlement is sufficient for being considered ""local.""**
  * This is a **key economic and social indicator of rootedness or legitimacy in the local community**, which aligns with a specific RL category.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as it suggests that **economic participation (e.g., receiving dividends) is used to define or legitimize local identity**.
  * The author is implying that **if someone receives a dividend, they are considered to have a legitimate or rooted local identity**, indicating a **financial or community-based criterion for local status**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL6"
不会说不算,** RL4," * The phrase ""不会说不算"" (literally, ""if you can't speak it, you don't count"") implies a judgment or exclusion based on the ability to speak a particular language or dialect. The author is expressing that lacking this linguistic ability disqualifies someone from being considered part of the group or community in question.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase centers on the ability to ""speak,"" which could be interpreted as a cultural-linguistic criterion for inclusion or exclusion.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase implies that the author uses **linguistic ability** as a standard for inclusion in the group. The attitude is **exclusionary**, and the author is endorsing this as a valid or necessary criterion for being considered ""one of us"" or ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly using **language or dialect** as a criterion for determining who is part of the ""local"" group. This is a strong endorsement of **cultural-linguistic recognition** as a standard for identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it uses the ability to speak a local language/dialect as a criterion for inclusion in the local group. The author is implicitly stating that linguistic ability is a key factor in defining who is ""local.""

**Step 6: Output Result**
  * The author believes that people (or the author themselves) should/often/can use the logic or standards represented by **RL4** to define who is/is not 'local', or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area.

**Output:** RL4"

RL3, RL4"," * The author is observing a linguistic and generational shift in Guangzhou, noting that many 00s-born locals are no longer fluent in Cantonese. The author implies a change in what it means to be a ""local"" in terms of cultural and linguistic continuity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土生土长的广州人"" (natively born and raised in Guangzhou) relates to **RL3**.
  * ""不会粤语"" (not speaking Cantonese) relates to **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is suggesting that being a ""local"" is no longer defined by fluency in the local dialect, as younger generations are losing this trait despite being born and raised in the city. This implies a **change in the cultural-linguistic criteria** for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **implicitly acknowledging** that traditional cultural-linguistic markers (speaking the local dialect) are no longer consistently present among younger locals, suggesting a **weakening of RL4 as a defining criterion**.
  * The author also **implies** that being born and raised in the city (RL3) is still a relevant identity marker, but it is **no longer sufficient** to guarantee ""localness"" in the traditional sense.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **RL3** and **RL4** to **contrast** how local identity is being redefined across generations. While **RL3** is still a relevant marker, **RL4** is being **challenged or weakened** in its role as a defining criterion.

从小是从什么时候开始？如果80年代生，不会说广州话不太可能。如果00年生，也很正常,"RL3, RL4"," * The author is discussing the relationship between birth year and fluency in Cantonese (Guangzhou dialect). The core intent is to suggest that being born in a certain time period (e.g., 1980s) is closely associated with being able to speak the local language, whereas being born later (e.g., 2000s) makes it more normal not to speak it. This implies a generational shift in cultural and linguistic identification with the local area (Guangzhou).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text references birth year and language fluency (Cantonese). These are linked to the speaker's identification with the local culture and identity.
  * The mention of ""00年生"" and ""80年代生"" suggests a historical or generational rootedness in the local area.
  * The author implies that being able to speak the local dialect is a marker of local identity for those born earlier, but not for later generations.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses birth year and language fluency to **imply a standard for judging whether someone is part of the ""local people"" group**.
  * The **generational difference in language fluency is used to define or differentiate local identity**—those born in the 1980s are expected to be Cantonese speakers and thus more ""local,"" while those born in the 2000s are not.
  * This suggests that **language and generational rootedness** are used as **criteria for evaluating local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **language (Cantonese) and generational history** are used to define who is ""local.""
  * These are not just observations, but **standards the author seems to accept as relevant for defining local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author implies that being born in a certain time period (1980s) is closely tied to the expectation of being able to speak the local dialect, which is a marker of local identity. This reflects how **growth history and generational background** are used to define ""local.""
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author **uses language fluency (Cantonese)** as a **criterion for judging whether someone is ""local.""** This is a clear cultural-linguistic marker.

RL4"," - The author is expressing surprise and reflection on how quickly non-local (or non-native) individuals can become fluent in a local language (Cantonese) and how this fluency can mask their non-local origin. The author also contrasts this with the perception that some locals may not maintain the language or cultural fluency as well as some non-locals. The core argument is about **language as a marker of local identity**, and how fluency in a local language can blur the line between local and non-local.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Language fluency (Cantonese)
  - Time of arrival and language acquisition
  - Contrast between locals and non-locals in language ability
  - Mention of ""sydney-born ABC"" (Australian-born Chinese) who speak fluent Cantonese

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using **language fluency** as a key indicator of whether someone can be considered ""local"".
  - The **ability to acquire and use the local language fluently**, even if not born there, is being highlighted as a **challenge to traditional notions of local identity**.
  - The contrast between **some locals who may not maintain the language** and **non-locals who do** implies that language fluency is a **more reliable marker of local identity** than birthplace or upbringing in the author's view.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **language fluency and cultural integration** are more meaningful criteria for judging whether someone is ""local"" than birthplace or upbringing.
  - The author **does not resist** the idea that non-locals can become just as local as those born there if they acquire the language and cultural fluency.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's emphasis on **language fluency and cultural integration** aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  - The author’s contrast between **some locals who may not maintain the language** and **non-locals who do** implies a **rejection of birthplace or upbringing as the sole criteria** for local identity and instead **values cultural and linguistic fluency**.
  - This suggests that the author **implicitly supports the idea** that **language and cultural fluency** are **key criteria for defining who is ""local""**.

**Output:**

广州出世叫本地人..但系广州某村出世加有分红或有地叫土著.这样比较容易解释,"RL3, RL6"," - The author is attempting to clarify and differentiate between the concepts of ""本地人"" (local person) and ""土著"" (indigenous/local native) in the context of Guangzhou. The author emphasizes that being born in Guangzhou makes one a ""本地人"", but being considered a ""土著"" requires additional local rootedness, such as being born in a specific village and having land or dividends.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""广州出世叫本地人"" – birthplace as a basis for identity.
  - ""广州某村出世"" – specific birthplace within a village.
  - ""有分红或有地"" – ownership of land or dividends.
  - ""叫土著"" – considered indigenous or deeply rooted local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using birthplace as a basic standard for ""本地人"" and then layering additional criteria (ownership of land or dividends) to define a more rooted or authentic ""土著"" identity.
  - These elements are used to **differentiate levels of local identity** and to **justify a more exclusive or traditional form of local belonging**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses using **birthplace in the city** and **ownership of land or dividends in a specific village** as criteria for distinguishing between ""本地人"" and ""土著"".
  - These are used to define the **authenticity and depth of local identity**, which aligns with the RL criteria for rootedness and economic symbolism.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author emphasizes being born in a specific village (""广州某村出世"") as a basis for deeper local identity.
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** – The author references land ownership and dividends (""有分红或有地"") as indicators of deeper local rootedness and economic integration.

RL6"," - The question is asking whether the listener has received dividends or owns land. This is likely in the context of a discussion about property, ownership, and possibly local identity. The author is probing into the listener's **connection to the local area through property or financial benefits**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) and ""土地"" (land) suggests a potential link to **RL6**, as these are indicators of **economic status and depth of social roots** in a local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The question seems to be assessing whether the listener is **economically embedded in the local area**, which is a core component of **RL6**. The author is likely using **ownership of land or access to dividends** as a standard to determine whether someone is **deeply rooted in the local community** or has **influence in the area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **implicitly endorsing the use of land ownership and financial benefits (dividends)** as criteria to judge whether someone is **a rooted local or has influence in the local area**. These are key indicators of **RL6**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is using **ownership of land and access to dividends** to assess **how deeply someone is embedded in the local community**, which is a clear criterion of **RL6**. This is used to judge whether someone is a **""rooted local"" or has economic influence in the area**.

The author is likely emphasizing the **economic and property-based rootedness** of a person in a local area, possibly to imply a deeper or more legitimate local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""有分红"" (having dividends) implies economic involvement or ownership in the local community.
  - ""屋企有栋有红本子的楼"" (owning a house with a red certificate) refers to legal property ownership, a key element in defining rootedness and legitimacy in a place.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements are being used to **support the idea that someone is deeply rooted in the local area**—not just living there, but **owning property and having a share in the economic structure**, which may be seen as a marker of authenticity in being a ""local"".
  - The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **property ownership and economic participation are key indicators of being a ""real local""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is clearly using **property ownership** and **economic participation (dividends)** as **criteria to define or evaluate local identity**.
  - These are **not being resisted or described as external standards**, but are being used as **indicators of rootedness and legitimacy**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** is the most appropriate category. The author is using **property ownership (red certificate) and economic participation (dividends)** as a **symbol of being a rooted and legitimate local**, which aligns with the definition of RL6.

**Step 6: Output Result**

有祠堂有分红,"RL3, RL6"," * The phrase “有祠堂有分红” (there is an ancestral hall and there are dividends) suggests the author is referencing **community ownership, heritage, and economic participation** in a local setting. This appears to be used to describe a group of people who are **deeply rooted in the community**, possibly with shared heritage and financial ties to the local area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * “祠堂” (ancestral hall) is a strong cultural and historical symbol of rootedness and heritage.
  * “分红” (dividends) refers to economic participation or ownership, likely from community assets or land.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * These terms imply that **being a local is tied to both cultural heritage and economic involvement**, especially in a community-based setting.
  * The author seems to be using these elements to **define or imply who qualifies as a “local”**, based on **historical ties and economic participation**.
  * The author's attitude is likely **affirmative or descriptive**, suggesting that these are **criteria for authentic local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The reference to **ancestral hall** ties into **historical rootedness and cultural identity**.
  * The reference to **dividends** suggests **economic status and ownership**, which are markers of **stability and influence** in a local context.
  * Both are used to **define or evaluate the authenticity or depth of someone's local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The **ancestral hall** aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it implies long-standing family ties and heritage.

They believe that being a ""true local"" requires **generational roots** in the city (specifically Guangzhou), including the **presence of ancestral halls (祠堂)**, which symbolizes deep familial and historical ties to the area. In contrast, the author sees others who recently moved in or registered their household as ""new Guangzhou people"", not genuine locals.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""祖辈都是在广州这边的""** (Ancestors have been in Guangzhou) → RL3
  - **""有祠堂的这种才算""** (Only those with ancestral halls count) → RL3

  - **""我是广州本地，但是我增城这边的""** (I am a local of Guangzhou, but from Zengcheng) → RL1 and RL3

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **uses generational roots (RL3)** as the **primary criterion** to define who is a ""true local"".
  - The **presence of ancestral halls** is a **symbolic marker** of this rootedness and is used to **exclude newcomers** from the ""local"" category.
  - The **mention of household registration (新入户广州)** is used to **contrast** the author's own rootedness with that of others, implying that **administrative affiliation alone is not enough** to be considered a local.
  - The **author identifies with being from Zengcheng**, which is part of Guangzhou, but **does not consider it as ""core"" as the city center**, implying a **territorial or psychological boundary** within the city (RL1).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The administrative incorporation (RL2) is used to explain why Zengcheng people may not be seen as ""true"" locals in some social contexts.
  * The mention of ""broad sense"" of Guangzhou people (RL1) reflects the social perception or conventional identity boundaries.
  * The emphasis on speaking Cantonese (RL4) is presented as a key cultural marker for being considered a ""local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is making a distinction between genuine locals and those who merely claim to be.
  * The reference to ""分红"" (dividends) implies that economic participation or ownership is a marker of being a real local.

  - Mention of Guanggu Square as a specific area.
  - Reference to ""East Guanggu"" as a broader area.
  - Description of traffic as ""乱糟的"" (chaotic/messy), which could relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is indirectly using the traffic condition as a criterion to evaluate the quality of the Guanggu Square area.
  - By noting that the traffic is ""chaotic,"" the author implies that this area may not meet the standard of a ""good local"" living area.
  - The mention of ""East Guanggu"" and Guanggu Square suggests a comparison of different areas within the Guanggu region, possibly to distinguish between better and worse parts of the ""local"" area.

因为武汉平时只说汉口、武昌、汉阳三镇，区的话很多，比如汉口包含江汉、江岸、硚口、东西湖、等等等等区，在长江以北、汉水以北的地界都属于汉口。武汉是被长江和汉江分割成了3个部分，你说的那些区是行政区划，3镇才是地理说法，你口中的老武汉人没有说错,"RL1, RL2"," The author is clarifying the distinction between **administrative divisions** and **geographical/territorial identity** in Wuhan, defending the traditional geographical understanding of the Three Towns (汉口、武昌、汉阳) as the legitimate way to define local identity, rather than the more modern administrative districts.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions **""汉口、武昌、汉阳三镇""** as the traditional geographical units.
  - The author contrasts these with **administrative districts** like ""江汉、江岸、硚口、东西湖"".
  - The author emphasizes the **geographical boundaries** defined by the Yangtze and Han rivers.
  - The author defends the **traditional understanding** of ""老武汉人"" (old Wuhan people), implying this is the authentic way to define local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **geographical identity of the Three Towns** is used as the **basis for defining ""local people"" or authentic Wuhan identity**.
  - The **administrative divisions** are portrayed as **less relevant or secondary** to the traditional geographical identity.
  - The author **affirms the legitimacy of the traditional geographical view** and **implicitly rejects** the administrative view as the main criterion for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **supports the traditional understanding of local people** (老武汉人), implying that this is the correct or authentic way to define ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly endorses the traditional geographical division** of Wuhan (Three Towns) as the basis for local identity.
  - The author **rejects the administrative divisions** as the primary way to define local identity.
  - The author **supports the view of ""老武汉人""**, implying that their understanding of local identity is correct and authentic.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author endorses **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the Three Towns represent a **long-accumulated, socially conventional way of defining the local area and its identity**.
  - The author references **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, but **rejects it as the primary standard** for defining ""local people"", instead **contrasting it with the traditional geographical view**.
  - The author affirms the **traditional understanding of local people**, which aligns with **RL1** and **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness) in a broader sense, as the term ""老武汉人"" implies a long-standing, rooted identity in the city.

The core intent is to highlight **how living in a certain area (Guanggu) is associated with a higher social status**, and those who do not live there are looked down upon.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""住光谷"" (living in Guanggu)
  - ""不敢讲话"" (dare not speak)
  - ""鄙视链底层"" (bottom of the鄙视 chain)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""住光谷"" is used to **signal a high-status identity**, which is implicitly tied to being a ""local"" with **social or economic prestige**.
  - ""不敢讲话"" and ""鄙视链底层"" suggest a **hierarchy of local identity**, where **residence in a certain area (Guanggu)** is a **criterion for social superiority**.
  - The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **where one lives is a key indicator of their social status and, by extension, their ""local identity"" or legitimacy within a local community**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not explicitly reject** the idea that living in Guanggu equates to higher status.
  - The author **implies** that people who live in Guanggu are **higher in the鄙视 chain**, which is used to **define who is a ""true local"" or who is socially accepted**.
  - The **location of residence (Guanggu)** is used as a **symbol of social legitimacy and local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **implicitly uses the location of residence (Guanggu)** to define **who is considered a ""local with status""**.
  - This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, where **residence in a core area (Guanggu)** is **linked to economic status and social legitimacy**, and is used to **evaluate the quality or hierarchy of local identity**.
  - There is also a **strong implication of social segregation**, which is consistent with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, where **living in a certain area (Guanggu)** is **used to demarcate insiders from outsiders**, and **establishes a psychological or social boundary**.

  * This points to a cultural-linguistic marker being used to judge identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author implies that their identity is being judged by how they speak.
  * The phrase suggests that the speaker is not perceived as a ""local"" due to their accent, implying that **local identity is tied to linguistic markers**.
  * The author is not resisting this logic but is highlighting its impact on their own experience.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

The core idea is that these people view certain neighborhoods (like Liudu Bridge, Youyi Road, QuShui Building, Jianghan Road) as the true ""city center"" or ""core area,"" while areas outside of this (like Huangpu Road or beyond the inner ring) are seen as peripheral or even rural. This reflects a **mental map** of what constitutes the ""real local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to specific areas: ""Hankou core"", ""inner ring"", ""Wuhan TianDi"", ""Liudu Bridge"", ""Youyi Road"", ""QuShui Building"", ""Jianghan Road"", ""Huangpu Road"", ""People's Amusement Park area"".

  - Use of phrases like ""rooted in their minds"", ""considered as suburbs"", ""core area"", ""true city center"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  These elements serve to illustrate how **local identity is defined by territorial cognition and a mental map** of the city. The author is showing that for some Wuhan residents, especially those who live in or are associated with the traditional core of Hankou, the boundaries of what is considered ""city"" or ""local"" are not just physical but also **socially and emotionally constructed**. The author endorses this as a **legitimate and widely held standard** for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is clearly endorsing the **socially conventional territorial identity** as a key criterion for defining who is ""local"" or what constitutes the ""core local area."" The emphasis is on **how people mentally and emotionally define the city center and its boundaries**, which is used to distinguish between ""true locals"" and ""outsiders.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is expressing that **residents of the traditional core of Hankou** have a **strong territorial identity**, and they define ""local"" based on **historical, emotional, and socially accepted mental maps**.

The author defines their identity in terms of administrative boundaries (""administrative division"") but does not fully identify with the broader ""Wuhan"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""Newzhou"", ""Wuhan"", and the idea of administrative boundaries (""行政区划上算武汉人"").
  * The phrase ""感觉武汉人也不太看得起我们"" implies a perceived social or cultural distinction between groups.
  * The author's own identity is framed in relation to administrative definitions rather than cultural or social ones.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to ""administrative division"" is used to define the author's identity in contrast to a broader or more culturally defined ""Wuhan"" identity.
  * The perceived social exclusion suggests a cultural or social distinction, but it is **not used by the author as a standard to define who is ""local""**—it is more of a personal observation.

The core intent is to show how **occupational background and place of origin** were used to distinguish between ""us"" and ""them"" in social identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""家里人是武钢的"" (family works at Wugang) — suggests occupational identity.
  - ""铁饭碗"" (iron rice bowl) — a stable job, often associated with state-owned enterprises.
  - ""乡里伢"" (country bumpkin) — a derogatory term for someone from the countryside.
  - The contrast between Wuchang relatives and the author's background suggests **social identity and insider-outsider distinctions**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the contrast between the Wugang job and being called ""乡里伢"" to show that **even with a stable, prestigious job, the author is still seen as not fully ""local""** due to their rural background.
  - This implies that **occupational status is not enough to be accepted as a local** if one's **growth background or family origin is not considered ""local""**.
  - The use of ""乡里伢"" implies a **cultural-linguistic or social rootedness** distinction.

  - The term ""乡里伢"" implies a **cultural-linguistic or social rootedness** distinction, suggesting the author was not seen as ""one of us"" due to rural origins.
  - The contrast also subtly reflects **family historical rootedness**, as the author is being judged by where their family is from.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The author is judged by their family's background (being ""乡里伢"") and not by their parents' job at Wugang. This suggests that **family origin and growth history are still used to define who is considered ""local""**.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)**: The ""铁饭碗"" at Wugang is a symbol of stability and prestige, but it is **not sufficient to grant ""local"" status**. This implies that **occupational status alone is not enough to define ""local identity""**.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: The term ""乡里伢"" suggests a **linguistic or cultural label used to mark someone as an outsider**, indicating **cultural-linguistic recognition** as a boundary marker for ""local identity"".

 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","RL5, RL6"," - The author is comparing different districts in Wuhan in terms of GDP, development potential, population, and housing prices. The core intent is to **evaluate and distinguish the economic and developmental status of different areas**, and **imply which areas are more ""local"" in terms of quality, influence, and identity** based on economic and functional criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses GDP rankings, development potential, population, and housing prices.
  - The author contrasts wealthy vs. less developed areas (e.g., East Lake High-Tech Zone vs. Caidian District).
  - The author evaluates the ""quality"" of an area based on economic indicators and livability.
  - The author describes the **economic status and influence** of different areas and how they attract or lose population.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **GDP, development potential, and economic activity** are used to **evaluate the quality and competitiveness of an area**, which in turn affects whether it is considered a **valuable or authentic ""local"" area**.
  - The **housing prices and economic status** of residents are **used to judge the level of development and desirability of a district**, which can imply who might be considered ""local"" in a **socially or economically rooted sense**.
  - The author emphasizes that **only areas with strong fundamentals and industries can attract talent**, implying a **functional and economic-based definition of a ""local"" area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **uses economic and functional indicators (GDP, development, housing prices)** to **evaluate the quality and competitiveness of different districts**, which are then used to **define what constitutes a ""good"" or ""authentic"" local area**.
  - These indicators are **explicitly endorsed by the author as the basis for judging local areas**, and are **not merely described as others' views**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's use of **GDP, development potential, and housing prices** as **standards for evaluating the quality of a local area** fits **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.
  - The author also uses **economic status and the presence of high-income residents** as a **criterion for judging the depth of social roots and influence**, which fits **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

@🔥 @cwntry 想到xyl说土生土长的水果湖人,RL3," * The author mentions ""xyl说土生土长的水果湖人"", which implies a reference to someone (xyl) stating that they are ""natively grown"" (土生土长) and associated with the ""fruits of Los Angeles Lakers"" (水果湖人), likely a humorous or metaphorical way of saying they are a lifelong Lakers fan or deeply rooted in Lakers culture. The author is likely reflecting on the idea of being ""natively grown"" in a specific cultural or regional context, possibly in relation to identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""土生土长"" (natively grown) is a key indicator of growth history.
  * The term ""湖人"" (Lakers) may represent a local cultural or community affiliation.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""土生土长"" is used to describe someone who has grown up in a specific place or culture, aligning with the idea of deep-rooted identity.
  * The mention of ""湖人"" may be metaphorical, but it still implies a long-standing cultural or emotional connection to a group or place.
  * The author is likely affirming the idea that being ""natively grown"" is a significant part of one's identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author seems to endorse the idea that being ""natively grown"" (土生土长) is a meaningful aspect of identity.
  * The metaphorical use of ""湖人"" suggests a deep-rooted cultural or community affiliation, which may also be part of the author's implied criteria for identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * ""土生土长"" clearly falls under **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  * The metaphorical ""湖人"" affiliation may imply a form of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, though it is not clearly defined as a territorial boundary or social convention.

gdp 再高，跟汉南人有关系？,** RL1," * The author is questioning the relevance of GDP to ""汉南人"" (people from Hanshan), suggesting that high GDP may not benefit or be meaningful to them. The core intent is to emphasize a disconnect between economic indicators and the lived reality or identity of the local people.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""汉南人"" (people from Hanshan) is a key reference to a local identity.
  * The phrase ""跟汉南人有关系？"" (does it have anything to do with Hanshan people?) implies a distinction between the economic status of a region and the identity or experience of the local population.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The reference to ""汉南人"" is central to the author's point: that economic development (GDP) is not necessarily tied to the identity or well-being of the local people.
  * The author is implicitly using the identity of ""汉南人"" as a contrast to the broader economic narrative.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly defining what makes someone a ""汉南人"", but the use of the term ""汉南人"" in contrast to GDP implies that the author is referencing a specific local identity that is distinct and not defined by economic metrics.
  * There is no explicit endorsement of specific criteria (e.g., administrative status, cultural traits, etc.), but the contrast implies a rootedness or distinctiveness of the local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's reference to ""汉南人"" and their questioning of the relevance of GDP suggests a focus on **regional identity** that is not defined by economic indicators. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is implicitly endorsing a local identity based on a sense of place or regional distinctiveness.

They feel that people from outside Wuhan, who were originally rural and engaged in farming, are now on equal footing or even surpassing them in the city, leading to a loss of status and dignity. The author implies that this perceived threat to status justifies a sense of exclusion or xenophobia.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" — implies long-standing family historical rootedness in the city.
  * ""外地人"" — indicates a distinction between ""local"" and ""outsider"" based on origin.
  * ""排外"" — suggests a social boundary drawn between ""locals"" and ""outsiders"".
  * The contrast between ""老市民"" and ""外地人"" implies a socially conventional territorial identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **family historical rootedness** (""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"") to establish a sense of legitimacy and authenticity in being a ""local"".
  * The **social distinction** between ""老市民"" and ""外地人"" is used to justify the author's resentment and the need to ""reclaim dignity"" through exclusion.

经开合并进去了，我前几年就是住的经开，档案上填的就是这个，后来变成汉南了，搞得我很懵啊,RL2," - The author is expressing confusion about a change in administrative designation of the area where they live, which has caused uncertainty in how they identify the area and their own identity in relation to it. The key concern is the **impact of administrative boundary changes on identity and regional recognition**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""经开合并进去了"" (Echeng was merged into another area) — administrative change.
  - ""档案上填的就是这个"" (I filled in the file with this name) — personal historical record tied to the area.
  - ""后来变成汉南了"" (later it became Hannan) — change in official name and administrative designation.
  - ""搞得我很懵啊"" (it made me very confused) — emotional reaction to the change.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **using the administrative change** to express how **legal and administrative boundaries** affect **how people identify the area they live in and their own sense of being ""local""**.
  - The reference to filling in the file with the old name shows a **personal attachment to the previous administrative identity**.
  - The confusion implies that the author **relies on administrative legitimacy** to define what is ""local"" or where they belong.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **uses the administrative designation** (""Echeng"" vs. ""Hannan"") as a **basis for defining the area** and **feels disoriented when it changes**, indicating that **administrative legitimacy is a key criterion** for them in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's confusion and emotional reaction stem from a **change in the administrative designation** of the area they live in. They **rely on the official name and administrative boundary** to define the area as ""local"" and their own identity within it. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the **legal and administrative boundaries** are used to define local identity.

  * ""武汉未来还是看光谷"" (Wuhan's future still lies in Guanggu) — potentially RL5 or RL6.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""土生土长的武汉人"" establishes the author as a person with deep roots in the city, supporting their perspective as a ""local.""
  * The author's reflection on how economic and developmental centers have shifted from Hankou to Guanggu suggests a changing evaluation of what constitutes a ""good local area"" in terms of economic vitality and quality of life.
  * The statement that many people from the city center now come to Guanggu for work implies that Guanggu has become a more attractive and functional area in terms of employment and livability.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author explicitly endorses Guanggu as a high-quality, functional, and economically vibrant area that represents the future of Wuhan. This aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  * The author also implies that Guanggu's development is attracting people from other parts of the city, suggesting it has become a new center of local economic and social life. This supports RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism) as a criterion for evaluating the value of a local area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's reflection on the economic and developmental shift in Wuhan, particularly the rise of Guanggu, is used to evaluate the changing quality and value of local areas. This is consistent with RL5 and RL6.
  * The author's own identity as a ""native-born Wuhan resident"" supports their legitimacy in evaluating the city's local areas, but it is not the primary criterion they use to define ""local identity"" in the context of their argument.

They portray Xinzhou as a remote and insignificant area, especially after the development of Yangluo (which is now part of or overshadowed by Huangpi). The author is using this comparison to define the boundaries of a ""real local"" or ""developed local"" area, implicitly suggesting that Huangpi is the legitimate core of the region.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **Huangpi** and **Xinzhou** as distinct areas.
  - Reference to **airport**, **logistics and commodity market**, **cultural tourism**, and **two metro lines** as development indicators.
  - The phrase “把阳逻剁有了” implies a shift in administrative or social recognition, with Yangluo being absorbed or reclassified.
  - Xinzhou is described as a **""remote and isolated small village""**, which signals a loss of status or centrality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **using infrastructure, economic development, and cultural tourism** to distinguish between a ""real local"" area (Huangpi) and a ""less local"" or ""outsider"" area (Xinzhou).
  - The **reclassification or decline of Yangluo** implies a shift in what is considered the core of the region, which is part of the author's territorial definition of ""local.""
  - The **remote status of Xinzhou** is used to contrast with the developed and central Huangpi, reinforcing the idea that only areas with certain development indicators count as ""real locals.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is using **infrastructure and economic vitality** to define which areas are considered ""local"" in a meaningful or central way.
  - The **shift in administrative or social recognition of Yangluo** reflects a **change in the author's mental map of the region**, which is part of how they define local identity.
  - The **contrast between Xinzhou and Huangpi** is used to define the **boundaries of what constitutes a ""real local"" area**.

They emphasize that ""suburbs"" were administrative designations, not necessarily based on cultural, social, or personal identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase ""行政意义上的郊区"" (administrative suburbs) directly relates to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  * The mention of ""中山路开元"" (Zhongshan Road Kaigen) and the distinction between it and other areas suggests a historical or conventional regional boundary.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is pointing out that the historical distinction between urban and suburban areas was **based on administrative definitions**, not on other criteria like cultural identity or personal growth history.

  * The author critiques the idea that only certain areas or people are ""real Xiamen people.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The administrative integration (e.g., merging of districts) is used to counter the claim that Jimei or Tong'an are not part of Xiamen. It supports the idea that these areas are now legally and administratively part of the city.
  * The mention of historical names and identities (e.g., “集美人”, “灌口人”) shows that these areas had distinct identities long before integration but are now part of Xiamen.

They suggest that Xiamen is a highly desirable place to live and that locals value returning to live and work there. The author also notes that while the average wage may seem low due to a large number of lower-income residents, key sectors like government jobs and state-owned enterprises offer relatively high salaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""厦门本地人只要在厦门有房子"" (Xiamen locals who have a house in Xiamen) – suggests property ownership as a marker of local identity.
  - ""厦门的国企包括公务员的工资平均都要比福州高很多"" – references economic status and job type.
  - ""集中环境教育交通医疗都在线的城市"" – highlights functional livability.
  - ""厦门的环境，基本上很少看到都市圈环境能做到这样的"" – emphasizes environmental quality.
  - ""人其实也不算多，全国中等吧"" – implies population density as a factor in quality of life.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is positioning Xiamen as a high-quality place to live, and in doing so, they implicitly suggest that people who value these qualities and choose to live in Xiamen are the ""real"" or ""true"" locals.
  - The mention of property ownership (""有房子"") is used to indicate a deeper connection to the city and a form of rootedness.
  - The discussion of job sectors (e.g., ""国企"", ""公务员"") and economic status is part of the author's broader argument about Xiamen's quality, but it is not directly used as a criterion for defining who is a ""local"".
  - The focus on environmental and functional livability (education, transportation, healthcare) supports the author's argument that Xiamen is a desirable place to live, which indirectly reinforces the idea that people who choose to live and return to Xiamen are ""true"" locals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly uses **property ownership** as a criterion for being a ""local"", especially in the phrase ""厦门本地人只要在厦门有房子"".
  - The author **explicitly emphasizes functional livability and environmental quality** as defining features of Xiamen, which indirectly contributes to how one might define ""local"" identity by suggesting that those who appreciate and remain in Xiamen are ""true"" locals.
  - The economic status of certain job sectors is **not used as a direct criterion** for defining local identity, but rather as part of a general discussion about the city's appeal.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output:"
听说厦门的房价都是隔壁市区的富商炒起来的,RL6," - The author is discussing the rising housing prices in Xiamen and attributing this to the actions of wealthy individuals from neighboring districts. The author implies that these wealthy outsiders are driving up the prices, suggesting that they are not ""local"" in the sense of being rooted or authentic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase ""隔壁市区的富商"" (wealthy people from neighboring districts) suggests an implicit contrast between locals and outsiders based on origin and economic power.
  - The idea of ""炒起来的"" (driving up prices) implies a critique of how these outsiders are influencing the local housing market, which may be seen as a distortion of the local identity or values.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the origin (neighboring districts) and economic power (wealthy individuals) of the people driving up housing prices to distinguish them from ""real locals.""
  - The author seems to imply that these outsiders are not part of the local identity, as they are not rooted in the area and are instead manipulating the local economy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author appears to use the idea of economic influence and non-local origin as a way to define who is not a ""local,"" implying that true locals would not behave in such a way.
  - The critique of outsiders' influence suggests a value placed on local authenticity and economic stability, which is tied to identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implies that ""local identity"" is contrasted with outsiders who are economically powerful but not rooted in the area. This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as the author uses the idea of economic influence and lack of local roots to distinguish between ""real locals"" and outsiders.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL6"
堵车！不好停车！房价高,**," * The author expresses dissatisfaction with urban life by listing negative aspects: traffic congestion, difficulty in parking, and high housing prices. However, there is **no clear indication** that these are used as criteria to define who is or is not ""local"", or to evaluate the ""quality"" or ""scope"" of a local area in terms of identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The terms ""堵车"" (traffic jam), ""不好停车"" (hard to park), and ""房价高"" (high housing prices) could be interpreted as indicators of urban quality or livability. These could potentially be linked to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** if they are used to evaluate a place as a ""good local area.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **expressing personal dissatisfaction or critique of urban conditions**, but **not using these features to define ""local identity""** or to evaluate the legitimacy of someone as a ""local person."" The focus is on **personal inconvenience and economic burden**, not on defining who belongs or does not belong in the local identity system.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The listed issues are **not used by the author as criteria for defining ""local identity""**. They are **personal complaints** and **not tied to the logic of who is or is not a local person** or to the evaluation of local areas in terms of identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * Since the author does not use these features to define or evaluate local identity, **no RL category is applicable** in this case.

**Output:**"
厦门房价比广州还高,N/A," * The author is comparing the housing prices of two cities,厦门 (Xiamen) and 广州 (Guangzhou), and is pointing out that Xiamen's housing prices are even higher than those in Guangzhou. However, the statement does not explicitly or implicitly discuss how this housing price comparison is used to define ""local identity"" or evaluate the ""quality/scope of a local area.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""房价"" (housing prices), which may relate to RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as housing prices can be linked to economic status and real estate ownership. However, the author does not connect this to the definition or evaluation of ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The text is focused on a factual or observational comparison of housing prices. There is no indication that the author is using this to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or the characteristics of ""local people.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * No RL criteria are clearly used to define ""local identity"" or evaluate the quality or scope of a local area. The author is not expressing a view on who is or is not ""local"" based on housing prices or any other RL-related criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The statement is about housing prices but does not provide any criteria or logic for defining or evaluating ""local identity."" Therefore, no RL categories are applicable.

The author feels that people who were born and raised in Qingxiu District are the ""real locals,"" while those who moved in later (from towns or for housing/settlement purposes) are trying to claim superiority, which the author finds unfounded.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""我和我小学初中同学们在青秀区土生土长"" → relates to growth history.
  - ""新南宁人"" → implies a contrast between ""newcomers"" and ""old residents.""
  - ""乡镇来这边买房定居或读书的同学"" → implies migration history and settlement.
  - ""优越感爆棚"" → implies a claim of local identity by newcomers.
  - The contrast between those who grew up there and those who came later is central.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses their own and their classmates' **growth history in Qingxiu District** as a basis for claiming ""local"" identity.
  - The author implicitly **rejects the legitimacy** of the ""local identity"" of those who moved in later, especially from the countryside.
  - The author is **critical of the perceived claim to superiority** by newcomers, suggesting they are not ""real locals.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** as the basis for defining ""local identity.""
  - The author implicitly rejects the legitimacy of newcomers claiming local identity, which aligns with RL3's focus on **growth history and intergenerational rootedness.**
  - There is **no strong endorsement** of administrative, linguistic, or economic criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author’s core argument is that ""real locals"" are those who were born and raised in Qingxiu District. The author implicitly contrasts this with newcomers who, despite settling in the area, do not have the same claim to local identity. This aligns with RL3, which emphasizes **growth history and intergenerational rootedness** as the foundation of local identity.

**Output:** RL3"
青秀区以前不就是大农村吗小时候在埌西，西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷，后面一几年到东盟商务区买房，也是几千块一平而已,"RL5, RL6"," * The author is reflecting on their personal experience of living in different areas of Nanning (Làngxī and Xīxiāngtáng) and how their social status or perception changed after moving to the more developed **ASEAN Business District** and buying property there. The author is subtly expressing that **moving to a more developed and prestigious area** changes how one is perceived and is implicitly using **housing and location** as a marker of social status and identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions:
    - ""青秀区以前不就是大农村吗"" (Qingxiu District used to be a big rural area) – suggests a change in the area's status.
    - ""小时候在埌西，西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷"" – implies a social status or identity difference based on where one lives.
    - ""后面一几年到东盟商务区买房，也是几千块一平而已"" – indicates a shift in economic status and location, and possibly a shift in perceived ""local"" identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using **real estate ownership and location** to **imply a shift in social standing and identity**. The move to the ASEAN Business District, and the relatively low price at the time, is used to suggest that **owning property in a more developed area** is a **symbol of economic success and a more ""legitimate"" local identity**.
  * The contrast between ""rural"" and ""urban business district"" also implies a **change in the perception of what counts as a ""good"" or ""legitimate"" local area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **owning property in a more developed or prestigious area** is a **marker of economic status and local identity legitimacy**.
  * The author **also implicitly conveys** that **areas can change from rural to urban**, and this **change in function and environment** affects how people are perceived and whether they are seen as ""local"" in a more legitimate or desirable sense.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: The author contrasts the ""rural"" past of Qingxiu District with the ""ASEAN Business District"" as a more developed and desirable area. The author implies that **areas with better functional livability (e.g., commercial, business development)** are seen as more legitimate or desirable local areas.
  * **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author implies that **owning property in a prestigious area** is a **symbol of economic status and legitimacy** as a ""local"", especially when it leads to a change in how one is perceived by others.

They contrast their own childhood experiences (growing up in an area near the Medical University) with the need to travel to other areas (ChaoYang, Xiangtan) for entertainment or shopping, implying that their own background is not one of privilege or local centrality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""青秀区土著"" (natives of Qingxiu District) suggests a territorial identity and possibly a social hierarchy.
  * The author's own childhood location (""我小时候在医科大那边"") suggests a personal growth history.
  * The act of ""去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑"" (had to go to ChaoYang and Xiangtan for shopping and entertainment) implies a spatial and functional evaluation of the author’s childhood area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author contrasts their own background with that of Qingxiu District natives, subtly implying that their childhood area was less developed or less central.
  * By referencing their childhood location, the author is using their personal growth history to define a contrast in identity.
  * The need to go to other areas for basic urban activities implies a functional or livability-based evaluation of their childhood area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author implicitly uses personal growth history and functional livability as criteria to position themselves as non-privileged or non-core ""local people"", contrasting with Qingxiu District natives.
  * The author does not explicitly oppose the idea of territorial identity or functional livability as defining criteria for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author references their childhood location to establish a sense of identity that contrasts with Qingxiu District natives.
  * **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** – The author implies that their childhood area lacked the functional livability of Qingxiu District, which is used to question the legitimacy of Qingxiu District's ""local"" superiority.

朝阳广场的人流大而且确实鱼龙混杂啊，但是正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好,RL3," * The author is commenting on the nature of the Chaoyang Square area in Nanning, describing it as crowded and mixed in terms of people. However, the author claims that ""authentic Nanning locals"" would not criticize Chaoyang, implying that such criticism is from outsiders or those who do not truly belong to the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""正宗南宁人"" (authentic Nanning locals) implies a distinction between those who are considered ""true locals"" and others.
  * The phrase suggests that ""authentic locals"" have a different standard or attitude toward Chaoyang Square, which implies a cultural or identity-based judgment.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""正宗南宁人"" is used to establish who is considered a ""true local"" and who is not.
  * The author implies that ""authentic locals"" would not criticize Chaoyang, suggesting a shared cultural or identity-based understanding or acceptance of the area, which outsiders may not share.
  * This implies a cultural or identity-based criterion for who qualifies as a ""local"" and how they perceive their local environment.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using a cultural or identity-based standard to define who is a ""true local"" (正宗南宁人), and this is tied to how they perceive the local area (Chaoyang Square).
  * The phrase ""正宗南宁人"" suggests a culturally rooted or historically rooted identity that is implicitly endorsed by the author as the standard for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The phrase ""正宗南宁人"" implies a cultural or historical rootedness in the city, aligning with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  * The author is suggesting that only those with this rootedness would have a specific perception of Chaoyang Square, reinforcing the idea that local identity is tied to cultural and historical belonging.

The author does not explicitly or implicitly use these characteristics to define who is or is not a ""local person"", but rather to describe the area’s livability and convenience.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of ""城中村"" (urban villages), ""地铁站"" (subway stations), and ""建筑新旧混杂"" (new and old buildings mixed) may relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  - References to ""人多，热闹"" (crowded and lively) and ""图生活方便"" (for convenience of life) may also relate to RL5.
  - No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, family history, economic status, or occupation is made, so the other RLs are not directly relevant.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is describing the area's livability and convenience, and is not using these features to define who is a ""local person"" or to evaluate the scope or quality of ""local identity"". The text is more about the area's practicality for living, not about identity criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Although the text includes descriptions that could be interpreted under RL5 (e.g., convenience, livability), the author is not using these as criteria to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the quality of a local area in terms of identity. The focus is on the practical aspects of living in the area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The descriptions in the text relate to RL5, but the author is not using these to define or evaluate ""local identity"". The text is more about the area's livability and convenience for daily life, not about identity criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author describes differences in the **crowd characteristics** of different areas (e.g., dense vs. sparse), **specific locations** (ChaoYang Square, residential area), and **types of people** (young people, office workers). These could potentially relate to RL1 or RL5.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is not using the differences in crowd types or location characteristics to **define ""local identity""**. Instead, the author is describing their **personal experience and emotional reaction** to the vibrancy of a commercial area.
  * There is **no explicit or implicit use of these features as criteria to determine who is a ""local"" or to judge the legitimacy of local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **not using these observations to define or evaluate ""local identity""**, but rather to **describe and contrast different urban experiences**. Therefore, no RL criteria are used in the author's core argument for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author now reflects on this with a tone of mockery and criticism, pointing out the irony and hypocrisy in the woman's claim given the poor condition of the area she lives in. The author is expressing a belief that **true local identity is not based on self-proclaimed status or superficial claims**, and that **people in certain areas may wrongly believe they are ""local"" despite living in undesirable or low-quality areas**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The term ""南宁本地人"" (local person from Nanning) is used by the elderly woman.
  - The author critiques the **poor quality of the neighborhood** (e.g., ""某穷小区"" — a poor neighborhood, ""一楼是个瓦房停车场"" — a first-floor shed used as a parking space).
  - The author contrasts this with their own background (""山旮旯建政路那一代的"" — a remote area, implying they are from a different part of the city).
  - The author mocks the idea that simply living in a certain area (even a poor one) entitles someone to claim local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The elderly woman's claim to being a ""local"" is **not endorsed** by the author — in fact, it's **criticized**.
  - The **poor quality of the area** (RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition) is **used by the author as a criterion to question the legitimacy of the woman's ""local"" identity**.
  - The author's **own background** (""山旮旯建政路"") implies a different understanding of what constitutes ""local"", based on **different spatial and experiential roots**, but the author does **not clearly define** their own criteria for local identity.
  - The author is **rejecting the idea that simply living in a certain area (even a poor one) equates to being a ""true local""**, suggesting that **the quality or status of the area is a factor in evaluating the legitimacy of someone's local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse** any of the RL categories in a clear, direct way.
  - However, the **author implies that the quality of a neighborhood (RL5)** is a **criterion for evaluating whether someone is a ""true local""**.
  - The author **does not endorse the elderly woman's claim to being a local**, suggesting **disapproval of the idea that self-identification or low-quality living conditions equate to being a ""real local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **implicitly uses the quality of the neighborhood (RL5)** to **question the legitimacy of the woman's ""local"" identity**, indicating that **the author believes ""local"" identity should be associated with better living conditions or areas of higher quality**.
  - The author **does not explicitly endorse other RL categories** (e.g., administrative, cultural, historical, etc.), and the **focus is more on critiquing the woman's claim than defining a positive set of criteria**.

They are explaining that their current infrequency of visiting Chaoyang is due to practical issues (lack of parking) and increased options as they grew older. The focus is on a **change in behavior over time**, but the author also implies that **Chaoyang has a special place in their local identity** from childhood.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""本南宁人"" (a native of Nanning) – implies **local identity**.
  * ""小时候"" (as a child), ""长大了"" (grew up) – suggests **individual growth history**.
  * ""喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩"" (used to like going to Chaoyang with friends) – implies **emotional and habitual connection to a local area**.
  * ""能选择的地方也多了"" (more places to choose from) – may suggest **changes in the perception of local areas**.
  * ""朝阳又越来越难停车"" (Chaoyang has become harder to park at) – implies **functional livability issues** affecting continued use of the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author **identifies themselves as a ""native of Nanning""**, and this identity is tied to **childhood experiences in Chaoyang**.
  * The mention of **growing up and having more choices** suggests that **local identity can shift or become diluted with time and experience**.
  * The **lack of parking** is framed as a **practical barrier** to continuing the habit of going to Chaoyang, but it also subtly implies that **Chaoyang is still a meaningful or significant place** in the author’s perception of their local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **implicitly defines ""local"" identity** through **childhood and growth history** in a specific area.

The intent is to convey that Chaoyang was a core area of social and economic activity for the ""local business class"" in the past, and that this area holds symbolic and historical significance in the local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""南宁"" (Nanning) — a territorial reference.
  * ""朝阳"" (Chaoyang) — a specific area in Nanning, described as the center.
  * ""资本大佬"" (capital bigwigs) — implies individuals with economic influence.
  * ""聚会碰头"" (gather and meet) — suggests social and business networking.
  * ""老万国酒楼"" (Old Wan Guo Hotel) — a symbolic place for business talks.
  * ""那时候南宁不大的"" (Nanning wasn’t big back then) — implies a historical territorial scope.
  * ""以朝阳为圆心"" (with Chaoyang as the center) — suggests a territorial or mental map with Chaoyang as the core.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses Chaoyang as a symbolic and central location to represent the historical core of the local business community in Nanning.
  * The mention of the Old Wan Guo Hotel and the behavior of business elites (meeting, doing business) shows that these places and activities are part of the ""local"" identity of Nanning, particularly for the economically rooted class.
  * The phrase ""以朝阳为圆心"" suggests that the author sees Chaoyang as a center of influence and identity in the historical context of Nanning.
  * The author's attitude is nostalgic and affirming of Chaoyang's historical significance.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author endorses the idea that Chaoyang is historically central to Nanning's identity, particularly in terms of economic and social roots.
  * The author implies that being part of the business community centered in Chaoyang contributes to the identity of being a ""local"" in Nanning.
  * The author does not resist or negate these criteria; rather, they are part of the historical and social narrative being presented.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author presents Chaoyang as a historically recognized center of Nanning, implying its symbolic and cognitive role in defining the local identity. The phrase ""以朝阳为圆心"" supports this by establishing Chaoyang as the mental map center of the city.
  * **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** — The author describes Chaoyang as the place where ""capital bigwigs"" gathered, suggesting that economic influence and social connections are part of the local identity in Nanning.

They mention this experience with a humorous tone (""哈哈哈""), but the core intent is to reflect on a formative emotional or psychological experience related to a local place.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author mentions being from 西乡塘农村, which is a specific geographic and possibly cultural origin.
  - They describe a personal experience of visiting 朝阳广场 as a child and feeling fear due to the presence of beggars in public spaces like overpasses and subways.
  - The emotional response (""fear"") is tied to the area's characteristics.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of being from 西乡塘农村 suggests a rootedness in a specific geographic and cultural background.
  - The emotional and cognitive response to 朝阳广场 is described in a way that implies a contrast between the author's rural origin and the urban area, possibly reflecting on how urban spaces are perceived by those from different backgrounds.

  - The author contrasts past and present, indicating that the sense of ""local identity"" is tied to the social relationships and environment of the past.
  - The author suggests that physical return to the old neighborhood is not enough to regain the former sense of belonging, implying that identity is more about the social and historical context than physical location alone.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that being a ""local"" is defined by one's **growth history and deep-rooted social ties** in a specific place.
  - The author **implicitly conveys** that changes in **social relationships and environment** affect the sense of being ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The emphasis on ""大院长大"" and the loss of ""曾经的感觉"" aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author implies that one's identity as a ""local"" is shaped by growing up in a specific place.
  - The contrast between past and present, and the idea that ""过去的终将也是过去了,"" suggests a **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is reflecting on the shifting social and emotional boundaries of what constitutes ""local"" identity.

  - The **family's perception of urban areas** (e.g., Jiefangbei, Daping) is **based on their lived experience and generational history**, which is contrasted with the author's experience in a newer area (Zhaomushan).
  - The **author's attitude** is reflective and slightly ironic, especially in the contrast between their family's outdated perception and the current reality.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The **family's generational settlement history** is clearly used by the author to **illustrate what constitutes ""local"" identity**.
  - The **changing perceptions of what is considered ""urban""** are discussed, but **not as a criterion for local identity** in the author's argument—more as a reflection on urban development.
  - The **author does not use their own residence in a newer area** (Zhaomushan) to define their own local identity, nor do they suggest it should be used as a criterion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author emphasizes **family settlement history** and **generational rootedness** in defining what is ""local"".
  - The author's **own experience and current location** are mentioned but not used as criteria for defining local identity.

RL1, RL4"," * The author is emphasizing that the main urban area of Chongqing is predominantly inhabited by ""locals"", and that it is not like true first-tier cities with a large number of immigrants. The author notes that only in recent years have more people with foreign accents (i.e., outsiders) started to move in.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author mentions ""本地人"" (local people), ""外地口音"" (foreign accents), and compares Chongqing to ""真一线城市"" (true first-tier cities), which are often associated with high levels of migration and diversity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses the presence of ""local people"" as a distinguishing feature of Chongqing compared to first-tier cities, which are typically more immigrant-heavy. The mention of ""外地口音"" implies a contrast between those with the local accent (i.e., locals) and those with foreign accents (i.e., outsiders). This linguistic distinction is used to reinforce the idea of who is considered a ""local"" in the author's view.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""渝中区土著，大坪土生土长"" emphasizes the author's deep historical and personal connection to Daping in Yuzhong District. This is used to establish their claim to being a ""true local"" of that area. The mention of now living in Yubei is likely for contrast or to explain a current situation, but it does not imply a rejection of their original local identity or redefine what ""local"" means for them.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""口音"" (accent), ""重庆城头口音"" (central Chongqing accent), and ""区县口音"" (district/county accents).
  * These are clearly linguistic features being used to distinguish between who is considered ""local"" and who is not.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the **presence or absence of a specific accent** as a **defining criterion for local identity**.
  * The emphasis on the central Chongqing accent as the legitimate one and the exclusion of district/county accents indicates that **linguistic markers are being used to construct and reinforce a boundary between ""true locals"" and ""outsiders.""**

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **only people with the central Chongqing accent** are considered ""local"", and that **people with accents from surrounding areas are not**.
  * This is a **clear linguistic criterion** used to define ""local identity.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The RL category that best matches this is **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is using **language and accent** as a **defining standard for ""local people.""**

The author expresses regret that, in hindsight, it would have been better to stay in Yuzhong. The regret is linked to the idea that Yuzhong is now more valuable and possibly more ""authentic"" or prestigious.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The move from Yuzhong to Jiangbeipo.
  - The father's decision being influenced by work.
  - The house in Jiangbeipo and the subsequent change of household registration (hukou).
  - The lack of awareness of property value at the time.
  - The regret of not staying in Yuzhong, implying a value or identity associated with the district.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The move and change of hukou to Jiangbeipo are described as a result of external factors (work, housing), not identity or preference.
  - The regret of not staying in Yuzhong implies that Yuzhong has a higher status or is more ""local"" in the author's view.
  - The author implicitly uses the idea of where one is born, raised, or has deep roots (Yuzhong) as a standard for ""being a real local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly values being rooted in Yuzhong, suggesting it is a more legitimate or prestigious ""local"" identity.
  - The change of hukou is described as a result of external factors, not identity.
  - The regret implies a belief that staying in Yuzhong would have aligned better with a ""true local"" identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's regret and the implicit preference for Yuzhong as a more ""legitimate"" place to be ""local"" aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, where Yuzhong is implicitly seen as the core area with a more authentic local identity.
  - The father's change of hukou is based on housing and work, not identity, but the author implies that Yuzhong has a more prestigious or authentic status, which aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where hukou is used as a marker of identity.
  - The author reflects on the father's long-term settlement in Jiangbeipo, but the regret implies that being born and raised in Yuzhong is more valuable, aligning with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, where early settlement or generational roots define ""local"" identity.

The author seems to contrast ""natives"" with ""outsiders"" and is implicitly defining what it means to be a ""local"" through historical settlement and birthplace.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally), ""以前就没多少人"" (few people lived there in the past), ""外来的比较多"" (many were outsiders) all relate to the historical settlement and birthplace of people, which are key elements in defining ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using the idea of being ""born and raised in the city center"" as a criterion to distinguish ""true locals"" from ""outsiders."" The reference to ""few people being born and raised there"" and the contrast with ""many outsiders"" implies that the author sees the lack of native-born residents as a defining feature of the city center's demographic history.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised"" in a place is a significant criterion for being considered a ""local."" This is used to define the identity of the city center's population historically.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""梅溪湖"" (Meixihu) is a specific area mentioned.
  * The author lived there for 3 years.
  * The property was sold before the price dropped.
  * The husband ""吐槽了三年"" (complained for three years).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**

The phrase carries a sense of familiarity and possibly regional pride or identity, as the author distinguishes ""二环的乡里"" from themselves in a lighthearted manner.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""二环的乡里"" implies a regional or territorial identity, possibly rooted in a shared cultural or social background.
  * The use of ""乡里"" (villagers, people from the countryside) suggests a colloquial or affectionate label for people from a specific area, which could be tied to historical or social perceptions.

  * The phrase ""二环的乡里"" is used to distinguish a group of people based on their geographic and possibly cultural background.
  * The author's tone is humorous but implies a shared understanding of what it means to be ""from 二环"" (the second ring), suggesting a shared identity or perception of that area.
  * The author is not resisting the label but is using it in a way that suggests it carries a recognizable and possibly shared meaning among the audience.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The phrase ""二环的乡里"" implies a socially conventional territorial identity. The author uses this label in a way that suggests it is meaningful and shared among people who identify with that area.

The core intent is to show how their identity as a ""local"" is being questioned or redefined based on where they live and where they were raised.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""小时候在五一广场出生长大的"" (Born and raised in Wuyi Square as a child) → potentially RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - ""结婚之后住在梅溪湖"" (After marriage, living in Meixihu) → potentially RL1 or RL5 (territorial or functional livability judgment).
  - ""爸妈说我是到乡里去了说鸟不拉屎的地方"" (My parents say I moved to the countryside, a place so bad that not even birds come) → potentially RL1 (territorial identity) or RL5 (evaluation of livability).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using their childhood location (Wuyi Square) to establish their ""local"" identity and contrast it with their current residence (Meixihu), which their parents regard as non-local or undesirable.
  - The parents’ judgment (""到乡里去了"", ""鸟不拉屎的地方"") implies a territorial or cultural boundary, suggesting that living in Meixihu is not considered ""local"" or is considered less desirable.
  - The author is not explicitly resisting the parents’ judgment but is using it to show a shift in identity or social perception.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly accepts the idea that being born and raised in a specific area (Wuyi Square) defines one as a ""local"", which aligns with RL3.
  - The parents’ judgment of Meixihu as a remote, undesirable place implies a socially conventional territorial identity (RL1), which the author is indirectly endorsing through their description.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - RL3 is supported by the author's description of being born and raised in Wuyi Square.

  * The author endorses the idea that being rooted in the area (family, work, social network) is a key criterion for being a local.
  * The author also implicitly defines the scope of the local area through a conventional understanding of its boundaries.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's emphasis on being rooted in the area aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  * The correction of the southern boundary reflects **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it implies an accepted or conventional understanding of where the local area ends.

**Output:**

嘴巴放干净点，啥都不懂。湘江新区是功能区而非行政区，岳麓区委、区政府与湘江新区党工委、管委会实行区政合一的运行方式。,RL2," * The author is correcting a misconception or misinformation, emphasizing that the湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New District) is a **functional area**, not an administrative one, and that the岳麓区 (Yuelu District) government and the湘江新区 management share a unified administrative structure (""区政合一"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions **湘江新区** and **岳麓区**, two geographical areas. The author discusses the **administrative and functional status** of these areas, distinguishing between a ""functional district"" and an ""administrative district"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author's core argument is about **clarifying the administrative and functional identity** of湘江新区. The author implicitly affirms that the **definition of a ""local"" area** involves its **administrative legitimacy** (i.e., whether it is an administrative or functional district), and that this distinction is important for correctly understanding the region's identity and governance.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **affirms** the **importance of administrative legitimacy** in defining the scope and identity of a ""local"" area (湘江新区 is not an administrative district, but a functional one). This aligns with the RL2 criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is emphasizing the **administrative legitimacy** of defining a region’s status and governance, which is a key aspect of RL2. The author implicitly uses this standard to define or clarify the ""local"" identity of湘江新区.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL2"

RL2"," * The author is questioning the administrative identity of ""Yuelu District"" and ""Xiangjiang New Area"", and is challenging whether the latter has the same status as the former in terms of **formal administrative boundaries**. The author's core intent is to argue that **Xiangjiang New Area is not an administrative region but a special economic area**, and thus should not be used to define or replace the **legitimate administrative identity** of Yuelu District.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text mentions ""岳麓区人民法院"" (Yuelu District People's Court), ""岳麓区zf"" (Yuelu District government), and the distinction between ""岳麓区"" (Yuelu District) and ""湘江新区"" (Xiangjiang New Area).
  * The author discusses **the difference in status between an administrative region and an economic special zone**, and **questions the legitimacy of using the latter to define administrative identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **""Yuelu District"" as a symbol of legitimate administrative identity**, and **""Xiangjiang New Area"" as a contrast**, which is not a true administrative region.
  * The author implies that **only areas with formal administrative status (like Yuelu District) should be considered ""local"" in the administrative sense**, while **economic special zones like Xiangjiang New Area should not be used to redefine or replace administrative identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly **using administrative legitimacy (RL2)** to define what counts as a ""local"" area and who can be considered to belong to a ""local"" administrative identity.
  * The author **rejects the idea that economic special zones like Xiangjiang New Area can be considered legitimate administrative regions**, which aligns with RL2's focus on **legal and administrative boundaries**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that **only areas with formal administrative status (like Yuelu District) should be considered legitimate ""local"" regions**, and that **economic special zones (like Xiangjiang New Area) should not be used to redefine or replace administrative identity**.
  * This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author is using **legal and administrative boundaries** to determine the legitimacy of ""local identity"".

**Output:**

确实，湘江新区只是个功能区，行政区还是叫岳麓区，湘江新区相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方,"**
RL1, RL2"," * The author is clarifying the distinction between administrative divisions and functional zones, specifically in the context of the ""湘江新区"" (Xiangjiang New District). The core intent is to explain that while the Xiangjiang New District is an economic or functional zone, the actual administrative region is still considered ""岳麓区"" (Yuelu District), with some parts of ""望城区"" (Wangcheng District) included. The author is not directly discussing identity, but the **definition of regional boundaries** and **how they are perceived or categorized**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The text references ""湘江新区"" as a functional zone and ""岳麓区"" and ""望城区"" as administrative regions. This implies a **difference in how regions are defined**—functionally versus administratively.
  * The author is **clarifying the boundaries** of what is considered ""local"" in terms of **administrative legitimacy** and **territorial identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **defining the scope of a ""local"" area** by distinguishing between **administrative boundaries** and **functional zones**.
  * The author **implicitly assumes** that ""岳麓区"" is the **legitimate administrative area**, and ""湘江新区"" is a **functional or economic zone** that overlaps with it and parts of another district.
  * This reflects an **administrative legitimacy** and **territorial identity** framework for defining what counts as a ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author uses **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) to define what is considered the ""real"" local area.
  * The author also implies **territorial identity** (RL1) by highlighting the **historical and socially accepted administrative boundaries** versus the newer functional zone.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author **uses administrative legitimacy (RL2)** to define the legitimacy of the local area.
  * The author also **implicitly uses territorial identity (RL1)** by emphasizing the **difference in perception between administrative and functional definitions** of a region.
  * These two RLs together help the author clarify **what counts as ""local""** in both **administrative and socially accepted terms**.

RL1, RL3"," * The author is expressing a strong belief that only a specific area (e.g., Tianxin District's Poshijie) qualifies as the ""true"" or ""real"" urban core (""old city center""), while other areas like Yuhua, Kaifu, Yuelu, Taomǎ, and Wangcheng are not considered ""urban"" or ""local"" in the same sense. The author supports this view by referencing historical and generational roots, as well as a contrast between old, authentic urban areas and newer or more rural ones.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * - ""只有天心区算城区"" (Only Tianxin District counts as the city center)
  * - ""其他都是乡里"" (others are rural)
  * - ""我老公土生土长的坡子街人"" (my husband was born and raised in Poshijie)
  * - ""老城区只有坡子街那一块小破地"" (the old city is only that small, run-down area of Poshijie)
  * - ""开福区雨花区都没人住的荒郊野地"" (Kaifu and Yuhua districts were once uninhabited wastelands)
  * - ""河西的岳麓区啊跳马啊望城了，那更加不算"" (Yuelu, Taoma, and Wangcheng on the west bank are even less considered)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * - The author contrasts **Tianxin District (specifically Poshijie)** with other districts to define what counts as ""urban"" or ""local"".
  * - The mention of ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) is used to affirm the authenticity of being ""local"".
  * - The author uses **historical and spatial descriptions** (e.g., ""以前全是菜地"", ""荒郊野地"") to support the idea that other areas are not ""real"" local areas.
  * - The author **strongly endorses** the idea that **only Poshijie is the authentic old city**, and other areas are not part of the ""true"" local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * - The author defines ""local"" based on **historical urban core status** (RL1).
  * - The author defines ""local"" based on **generational roots and upbringing** (RL3).
  * - The author defines ""local"" based on **geographical and historical legitimacy**, contrasting it with newer or more rural areas (RL1).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * - The author believes that **only the old city center (Poshijie in Tianxin District) counts as the true local area**, and that other districts (Yuhua, Kaifu, Yuelu, etc.) are not ""real"" local areas. This is based on **historical and emotional recognition of the city's core (RL1)**.
  * - The author supports this view by referencing **the generational and upbringing background of her husband (RL3)**, implying that being born and raised in the old city is a key criterion for being a ""true local"".

The tone is humorous and self-deprecating, and the author seems to be reflecting on how their identity has changed or is now perceived due to their relocation history.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The author lists a series of residential locations: 南门口, 八角亭, 捞刀河, 暮云, 梅溪湖.
  * The phrase ""变成了xlb"" implies a contrast between ""old locals"" and ""newcomers.""
  * The sequence of moves is used to highlight a change in the author’s identity in relation to the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is using their **residential history** to signal a transformation in their local identity.
  * The author’s **movement across different areas** is used to imply a shift in status from someone who lived in ""traditional"" local areas to someone who is now a ""new local"" in a more modern or developed area (梅溪湖).
  * The use of ""xlb"" (new local) suggests that the author is **acknowledging a social or identity distinction** based on where one has lived and for how long.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **where one has lived and for how long** can influence whether they are seen as a ""local"" or not.
  * The author **does not resist** this logic but rather uses it in a self-reflective and humorous way.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author’s **residential history** and the resulting identity shift (to ""xlb"") suggest an **implicit recognition of the importance of where one has lived and for how long** in defining local identity.
  * This matches **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author’s identity is being evaluated based on their **growth and settlement history** in the region.
  * The shift in identity (to ""xlb"") also implies a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), as it reflects a **change in social perception or status** tied to the areas one has lived in.

**Step 6: Output Result**

RL1, RL3"," - The author is making a contrast between people from the countryside (""乡里"") and city dwellers (""城里人""), suggesting that there is a distinction between ""local"" and ""non-local"" people based on their place of origin or upbringing.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase ""乡里"" and ""城里人"" implies a contrast between rural and urban origins.
  - This may reflect an implicit belief that one's place of origin or upbringing is a key factor in determining whether someone is a ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is using the contrast between rural and urban backgrounds to highlight a difference in identity or status.
  - The attitude suggests a preference or implied legitimacy for ""city people"" over ""rural people"", but the key is whether this is used as a criterion for defining who is a ""local"".
  - The phrase ""哪有城里人"" may indicate that the author is surprised or dismissive of the idea that ""city people"" are considered locals, or that they are not viewed as authentic locals by the speaker.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The contrast between ""乡里"" and ""城里人"" implies a belief that one's place of upbringing or origin is a key factor in defining ""local identity"".
  - This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it reflects a belief that people from the countryside are not considered ""true locals"" in the city.
  - It also has a slight implication of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author may be implying that ""city people"" are the ones who truly belong.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is suggesting that people from the countryside are not considered ""local"" in the city, and that ""city people"" are the real locals.
  - This implies a belief that **growing up or being born in a place** is a key criterion for being considered a ""local"", aligning with **RL3**.
  - The contrast between the two groups also suggests a **socially accepted territorial identity**, aligning with **RL1**.

RL1, RL2"," The author is recounting a conversation where a colleague makes a derogatory comment about a place (""乡里别"") based on a stereotypical view of it as rural or backward. The manager corrects this by stating the area is now part of the ""development zone,"" implying it is no longer rural. The author highlights the colleague's ignorance and the manager's subtle retaliation, suggesting that the colleague's comment was based on outdated or incorrect assumptions about the area's status and identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to ""乡里"" (countryside/peasantry) as a derogatory label.
  - Mention of ""开发区"" (development zone) as a modern, urban, or administrative category.
  - The manager's correction implies a shift in the area's status and identity.
  - The colleague's judgment of the area as ""不好"" (bad) is based on outdated assumptions.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The use of ""乡里"" reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), where rural areas are seen as distinct and inferior to urban areas.
  - The mention of ""开发区"" reflects **administrative legitimacy** (RL2), as it refers to an official designation that changes the area's identity.
  - The author is highlighting how the colleague's judgment of the area was based on **socially conventional** and **outdated** views, and how the manager's correction is rooted in **administrative legitimacy**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly aligns with the manager's correction, suggesting that the **administrative legitimacy** of the area (now a development zone) is a more valid basis for identity than the **socially conventional** rural label.
  - The author implicitly critiques the colleague's reliance on outdated rural stereotypes.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's core argument is that the **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) of a place (being part of a development zone) is a more accurate and updated way to define its identity than the **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) of being ""乡里.""
  - The colleague's judgment is based on **RL1**, while the manager's correction is based on **RL2**.

住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,"** RL1, RL6"," * The sentence is a concise statement that distinguishes between two groups of people based on their place of residence and identity. The phrase ""住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人"" translates to something like ""Those who live in Beizheng Street are considered city people within the locals."" The author is making a distinction between ""locals"" (乡里别) and ""city people"" (城里人), and is placing the residents of Beizheng Street in the category of ""city people within the locals."" This implies a **hierarchical or symbolic division** within the broader concept of ""local identity.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key element is the **residence in Beizheng Street**, which is used to categorize someone as a ""city person"" within the local community. This suggests that **residential location** plays a symbolic or evaluative role in how the author defines or evaluates local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase implies that **residence in a specific area (Beizheng Street)** is a criterion for being recognized as a ""city person"" within the local group. This is not just a description of location, but an **evaluation of social identity and status** within the local community.
  * The author is using **residential area** to distinguish between different levels or types of ""local people""—those who are considered more ""urban"" or ""modern"" versus those who are perhaps more rural or traditional.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is using **residential location (Beizheng Street)** as a **symbolic or evaluative criterion** to define who is considered a ""city person"" among the locals. This aligns with **RL1** and **RL6**:
    - **RL1**: The author is using a **socially conventional territorial identity**—Beizheng Street is a symbolic or historically recognized area that plays a role in how the author evaluates local identity.
    - **RL6**: The author is using **residential location** to imply **depth of social roots or economic status**, suggesting that living in Beizheng Street is associated with a certain level of **local influence or urban identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is using **residential location** (Beizheng Street) as a **symbolic and evaluative standard** to distinguish between different types of ""local people""—those who are considered more ""urban"" (城里人) within the local group. This aligns with **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), as Beizheng Street is treated as a **symbolic or historically recognized area** within the local identity system. It also aligns with **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as the author is using **residence in a core urban area** to imply a certain **level of social influence or urban identity**.

**Output:** RL1, RL6"
