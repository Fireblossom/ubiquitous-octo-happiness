热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,RL1,"  
The author expresses strong pride in the ""North Gate"" (北门) of Xubei (possibly a district or area in a city), emphasizing its superiority over other parts of the Third Ring Road. The phrase ""论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" directly compares the North Third Ring Road area favorably to other sections of the Third Ring Road. The author also anticipates future development (""再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了"") and implies that this area will become even more prominent. This reflects a regional preference and a belief in the area's superiority, which is used to define a sense of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""咱叙北第一带盐人"" (we are the top ""salty person"" of Xubei) suggests a sense of local pride and self-identification with the area.  
- ""北门可不差"" (the North Gate is not bad) implies a positive evaluation of the area.  
- ""论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" (in terms of the outer Third Ring Road, the east and west parts may not be as good as the north part) explicitly compares different parts of the Third Ring Road, suggesting a belief in the North Gate as a core or superior local area.  
- ""再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了"" (once Huobei is developed, it will really take off) implies future development will further enhance the area's status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **regional comparisons and spatial evaluations** to define a sense of local identity, emphasizing the North Gate as a distinct and superior part of the city. The implicit logic is that **being from or living in the North Gate is a marker of ""true local"" status**, especially when compared to other parts of the city. This is not just a personal preference but is framed as a shared or habitual belief about what constitutes a ""real"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the belief that the North Gate is a distinct and superior part of the city, and that this spatial distinction is a meaningful part of local identity. This reflects a **socially conventional spatial cognition** of the city's structure.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a **shared or habitual spatial perception** of the city and the belief that the North Gate is a **distinct and superior local area**. The author uses this spatial logic to define and affirm a sense of local identity.

真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL4, RL3","  
The author is describing a pattern of social behavior in which individuals from the city center of Chengdu (referred to as ""土著"" or ""locals"") define themselves in contrast to those from the surrounding areas (""周边的""). These central Chengdu residents often express a sense of superiority by mocking the accents, dialects, and customs of people from the outskirts, and even by making distinctions in social practices such as marriage customs (e.g., dowry requirements). The author, being from a surrounding area, is repeatedly exposed to these attitudes and feels excluded or judged by the so-called ""true locals"" from the city center.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Geographical boundary** (""二环以内才是成都"", ""二环以外是四川"") – a clear spatial demarcation used to distinguish ""true Chengdu people"" from others.
- **Accent and dialect** (""口音"") – used as a marker of belonging or exclusion.
- **Self-identification as ""土著""** – implies a long-standing, rooted identity in the city center.
- **Mockery of ""周边的"" or ""乡坝头""** – suggests a social hierarchy based on spatial and cultural origin.
- **Social practices (e.g., dowry)** – used to further differentiate between ""genuine"" Chengdu people and those from the periphery.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not only describing the behavior of others but is also implicitly critiquing the criteria that central Chengdu residents use to define who is a ""true local."" These criteria include:
- **Geographical location** (within the Second Ring Road = Chengdu; outside = not Chengdu).
- **Dialect and accent** (as markers of authenticity).
- **Historical and cultural rootedness** (being ""土著"" implies deeper local identity).
- **Social and cultural practices** (e.g., dowry) as differentiators.

These elements collectively form a **symbolic ranking logic** that central Chengdu residents use to assert their local identity and exclude those from the periphery.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
While the author is **not explicitly endorsing** the criteria used by central Chengdu residents to define local identity, they are **describing and implicitly acknowledging** the **existence and influence** of these criteria. The author's frustration with being judged based on these standards suggests that they are **aware of and affected by** the symbolic logic of local identity, even if they may not fully agree with it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is clearly present: the author describes how the city center (within the Second Ring Road) is considered the ""real Chengdu,"" while the surrounding areas are not. This is a **shared, habitual spatial perception** used to define local identity.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is also present: **dialect and accent** are used as **markers of belonging**, with central Chengdu residents mocking those with different speech patterns.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is **implied** through the use of ""土著"" (native/indigenous) to denote those with long-standing local roots.

Output: RL1, RL4, RL3"
我是都江堰的，其他地方的我不敢说，但是我可是从小被成都口音嘲笑哦，我小时候去亲戚家耍过暑假，我说吃饭他们就笑我口音，现在去成都我都不敢开腔，有时候买东西都说普通话，经历过很多次被恶意学我说话,RL4,"  
The author identifies as from Dujiangyan and shares a personal experience of being mocked for their accent by Chengdu locals. This reflects a strong emotional and identity-related reaction to being judged based on linguistic-cultural differences. The author’s tone conveys a sense of exclusion and self-consciousness rooted in their regional accent, which is perceived as non-local by Chengdu people.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从小被成都口音嘲笑"" (mocked for my accent by Chengdu people since childhood) directly references dialect/accent as a marker of identity.
- ""我说吃饭他们就笑我口音"" (they laughed at my accent when I said 'eat') illustrates the use of language as a tool for distinguishing between locals and non-locals.
- ""现在去成都我都不敢开腔"" (now I don’t dare to speak in Chengdu) and ""买东西都说普通话"" (use Mandarin when shopping) show behavioral adaptation due to accent-based exclusion.
- The overall narrative centers on the **linguistic-cultural boundary** between the author and Chengdu locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's experience demonstrates that **language and accent are used by Chengdu locals to exclude or mock people from other nearby areas**, such as Dujiangyan. The author internalizes this as a defining boundary between ""locals"" and ""non-locals,"" even though they may live within the broader Chengdu administrative region. The emotional impact (shame, self-censorship) reinforces the symbolic role of language in local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts that **linguistic-cultural differences (accent/dialect)** are a key standard used to define who is considered ""local"" in Chengdu. While the author is from a nearby area and may technically be part of the Chengdu region, their accent marks them as ""non-local"" in the eyes of Chengdu locals, and this has real social consequences for them.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a boundary marker for local identity. The author is subject to exclusion and mockery due to their non-local accent, which aligns with the RL4 framework.

Output: RL4"
那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,"RL1, RL4","  
The author expresses discomfort and even aversion toward someone who claims to be a ""true Chengdu person"" by emphasizing their family's historical residence in the old city (e.g., ""二环以内"", ""宽窄巷子""). At the same time, the author mentions being mocked for speaking the local dialect of Dujiangyan, indicating that both **linguistic-cultural recognition** and **vernacular spatial authority** are used to distinguish between ""real locals"" and ""outsiders"" in the author's context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""那我说都江堰话被笑的更多"" (I get laughed at more for speaking Dujiangyan dialect) — this is a clear reference to **language/dialect** as a marker of identity and exclusion.  
- ""说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的"" (he told me his family used to live within the Second Ring Road, in Kuanzhai Alley) — this refers to **spatial historical roots** and **symbolic areas** (Kuanzhai Alley) that are considered core to Chengdu's local identity.  
- ""各种装b"" (showing off) — indicates that the speaker is using these spatial and linguistic markers to assert a superior or more authentic local identity.  
- The author's **negative emotional reaction** (""我就很厌恶"") suggests a **rejection of the criteria** used by the other person to define ""localness"", but the **very existence of those criteria** implies that the author is **aware of and implicitly acknowledges** them as part of the local identity framework.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reacting to someone else's attempt to assert local identity through **spatial historical rootedness** (living in the old city core) and **linguistic-cultural markers** (implying the speaker is a ""true Chengdu person""). While the author may not endorse the other person's behavior, the **criteria used by that person are still part of the local identity discourse**, and the author's **awareness and reaction to them** indicate that these criteria are **widely recognized and used** in the local identity system.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** the other person's behavior or their standards.  
- However, the **very fact that the author is reacting to them** shows that **these criteria are part of the local identity framework**, and the author **implicitly acknowledges** their **existence and relevance** in how local identity is constructed and contested.  
- Therefore, the **spatial historical rootedness** (RL1) and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4) criteria **are relevant to the author's context** and are **used by others in defining local identity**, even if the author rejects their **use in a performative or inauthentic way**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is present because the author is reacting to claims about historical residence in core areas like the Second Ring Road and Kuanzhai Alley, which are **symbolic of local identity**.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is also present because the author is being mocked for speaking the Dujiangyan dialect, which is used as a **cultural marker to distinguish locals from outsiders**.

Output: RL1, RL4"
那证明成都人的确不咋地，本来成都话口音离普通话语区就够偏了，很多怪音，他们还歧视本省的人，无语了都，儿化音就像大舌头一样，这是外地人评价的，为什么有些区县的来到成都要模仿他们的口音，本来就难听还要模仿是自己也不自信，大胆保持自己的地方本土特色有什么？,RL4,"  
The author is expressing frustration with the Chengdu urban group's attitude toward linguistic and cultural identity. They argue that Chengdu locals have a distinct dialect that is already different from Mandarin, and yet they discriminate against people from other parts of Sichuan. The author criticizes Chengdu locals for being unaccepting of regional diversity and questions the need for people from other districts to imitate Chengdu's dialect, suggesting it reflects insecurity and a loss of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Chengdu locals have a distinct dialect that is already different from Mandarin"" → **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4).  
- ""They discriminate against people from other parts of Sichuan"" → **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4), as dialect is a key identity marker.  
- ""Why do some people from other districts come to Chengdu and imitate their accent?"" → **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4), as the author is questioning the need to conform to a dominant linguistic identity.  
- ""Why not boldly maintain their own local characteristics?"" → **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4), as the author is advocating for the preservation of local dialects and identities.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **language and dialect** as a marker of local identity and social inclusion/exclusion. They criticize Chengdu locals for using their dialect to exclude others and question the value of imitating it, which implies that linguistic identity is a key factor in defining who is or is not ""local."" The author is also suggesting that maintaining one's own regional dialect and identity is a valid and proud form of being ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **language and dialect** should be used as a means of **cultural recognition and identity preservation**, and that imitating a dominant local dialect (Chengdu) is unnecessary and even a sign of insecurity. This implies that **linguistic-cultural recognition** is a key criterion for defining local identity in the author's view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author explicitly critiques the Chengdu locals' dialect as a boundary marker and questions the need to imitate it, emphasizing the importance of preserving one's own regional linguistic identity as part of local identity.

Output: RL4"
我朋友都江堰人在成都十多年现在已经是成都口音了，我估计是她怕融入不了所以就变成那样了吧,RL4,"  
The author discusses how a friend from Dujiangyan, who has lived in Chengdu for over a decade, has adopted a Chengdu accent. The author speculates that this change in accent might be a result of the friend's fear of not being able to integrate, implying that linguistic adaptation is a way to become more ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The friend is from Dujiangyan but has lived in Chengdu for over ten years.  
- The friend has adopted the Chengdu accent.  
- The author interprets this as an intentional or subconscious effort to integrate and become more ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting the **linguistic transformation** as a marker of integration into the local community. The adoption of the local accent is treated as a **symbol of becoming part of the local identity**, and the author interprets it as a strategy to overcome outsider status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly supports the idea that **linguistic adaptation** (i.e., adopting the local accent) is a meaningful indicator of integration into the local identity. This is not just a description of a phenomenon but a reflection of the author’s understanding of how one becomes ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as it uses **language and accent** as a boundary marker for local identity. The author implies that adopting the local accent is a way to be recognized as ""local,"" which is consistent with the core logic of RL4.

Output: RL4"
我也都江堰的，被别个说口音难听,RL4,"  
The author identifies as being from Dujiangyan and mentions being criticized for their accent. This implies that the speaker feels their **local identity is judged or mocked** based on their **language and accent**, which is a key marker of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我也都江堰的"" (I'm from Dujiangyan) — self-identification with a local area.  
- ""被别个说口音难听"" (being told that one's accent is unattractive) — implies **linguistic-cultural recognition** is used to judge whether someone is a ""true"" local or not, or to mock someone for not conforming to a ""standard"" local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The mention of being judged for one's accent indicates that **language and cultural speech habits** are being used as **boundary markers** to distinguish locals from non-locals or to evaluate the legitimacy of someone's local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is being **criticized**, the **fact that accent is used as a criterion for judgment implies that the speaker is aware of and implicitly acknowledges** the **linguistic-cultural recognition** standard in defining local identity. The speaker is not rejecting the standard but is expressing that they are affected by it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The use of **accent as a marker of local identity or legitimacy**, even when used to mock, aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, where dialect or accent is used to define or evaluate local belonging.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈 真的 确实 因为以前的周边的确实很弯 一说话就嫌弃 其实现在也一样 土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显 但对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走,RL4,"  
The author is reflecting on the way locals in Chengdu, particularly those from the inner ring area, distinguish themselves from outsiders through **accent**. They mention that **locals can immediately tell someone is not from the inner ring** by their **accent**, and that this distinction has historically been used to **exclude or look down on outsiders**. However, the author also notes that **local people are still very hospitable to outsiders**, such as helping them with directions. The core argument revolves around **accent as a marker of local identity**, used both to distinguish insiders from outsiders and to maintain social boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音明显"" (distinct accent) is directly mentioned as a distinguishing feature.  
- ""土著一听就晓得你不是成都的 (一环内的)"" (natives can immediately tell you’re not from the inner ring of Chengdu) shows **cultural-linguistic recognition** as a standard for identifying ""local people.""  
- The author implies that **local people use accent to judge someone's ""localness""**, and that this is a **socially accepted or habitual way of distinguishing insiders from outsiders**.  
- The **contrast** between **internal exclusion based on accent** and **external hospitality** is mentioned, but the focus is on how **accent is used to define local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting how **local Chengdu people use accent as a symbolic boundary marker** to distinguish between ""true locals"" (inner ring) and others. This reflects a **shared social habit** of using **linguistic cues** to identify and categorize people in terms of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **accent is a valid and commonly used standard** to define who is or is not a ""local"" in Chengdu. While the author does not explicitly criticize this standard, they describe it as a **socially accepted and ongoing practice**, even if it is sometimes used to express disdain toward outsiders.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author is describing how **accent** is used as a **cultural and linguistic marker** to distinguish ""locals"" from ""non-locals,"" which is a key feature of this RL category.

Output: RL4"
我内江的，挨着自贡方向，说话是纯正自贡口音，在成都十多年了，也在一环买了房子，直到现在我说话也是纯正自贡口音。说话就是交流，能听懂就行了，出自哪里不重要，自己有本事才是最重要的。从来不为口音是哪里而焦虑，也不需要去在意他人的看法，有这样看法的人也是肤浅，不值得交集，更不值得因此自我内耗,N/A,"  
The author identifies as being from Neijiang, near Zigong, and speaks with a ""pure Zigong accent."" Despite living in Chengdu for over a decade and even owning a house in the First Ring Road, they still speak with the same accent. The author emphasizes that **language/accents are not important** in defining one's worth or local identity. They reject the idea that one should be anxious about their accent or conform to others' expectations, and instead stress **personal capability and self-confidence** as the real indicators of value.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""纯正自贡口音""** (pure Zigong accent): This could relate to **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as it refers to a dialect/accent.  
- **""说话就是交流，能听懂就行了""** (speech is just communication, as long as it's understood): This **rejects** the idea that accent defines identity or worth.  
- **""出自哪里不重要，自己有本事才是最重要的""** (where you're from doesn't matter, what matters is your own ability): This **explicitly resists** using origin or accent as criteria for judging local identity.  
- **""从来不为口音是哪里而焦虑""** (never anxious about where one's accent is from): This indicates the **author does not endorse** RL4 as a standard for local identity.  
- **""有这样看法的人也是肤浅，不值得交集""** (people with such views are shallow and not worth interacting with): The author **explicitly opposes** the use of linguistic or regional identity as a basis for judgment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** the idea that accent or regional origin (RL4) should be used to define or judge local identity. They **endorse** the idea that **personal ability and confidence**, rather than linguistic or cultural markers, are what truly matter. The author's tone is dismissive of those who place value on such superficial markers, suggesting that **they do not see linguistic or regional identity as relevant to being a ""local""**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** any criteria related to **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).  
- The author **does not use** any other RL criteria (e.g., administrative boundaries, generational roots, etc.) to define ""local identity.""  
- The author's **core stance is to reject** using linguistic or regional markers as a basis for identity or value.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text **does not endorse any RL criteria** for defining ""local identity."" The author **explicitly resists** using linguistic or cultural markers (RL4), and **does not present any other criteria** (e.g., administrative, generational, etc.) as standards for defining local identity.

Output:"
我不内耗我也不觉得我们口音不好听，我只是觉得有些成都人笑别人很无语,N/A,"  
The author is defending their own dialect/accent and rejecting the idea that it is inferior. They also criticize some Chengdu people for mocking others, implying that such behavior is unacceptable. This suggests the author **does not endorse** using dialect or accent as a basis for judging someone's local identity in a derogatory or exclusionary way.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我们口音不好听"" (our accent is not nice to listen to) relates to **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4).  
- The author **rejects** the idea that their accent is inferior and **criticizes** Chengdu people who mock others for their accent.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not using dialect or accent as a standard** to define local identity. Instead, they are **opposing** the use of such linguistic differences to exclude or mock others. Their argument is about **rejecting** an implicit or explicit hierarchy of local identity based on linguistic-cultural recognition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the use of linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as a standard for defining or judging local identity. In fact, they **explicitly resist** it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text involves dialect and accent, the author **does not endorse** using it as a standard for local identity. Instead, they **reject** such behavior. Therefore, **no RL category is endorsed** in this text.

Output:"
你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,RL4,"  
The author is responding to a perceived slight or mockery, specifically a comment that ""our accent is cheap/low-class."" The tone implies that the speaker feels their dialect or accent is being devalued or used as a means to exclude or look down on them. This reflects a boundary marker based on linguistic-cultural identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音很贱"" (""our accent is cheap"") is a clear reference to linguistic-cultural recognition as a marker of identity.  
- The author implies that this kind of comment is used to judge or exclude people from the ""local"" group.  
- The focus is on how dialect or accent is used to assign symbolic value or status to individuals or groups.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The comment ""our accent is cheap"" represents a linguistic-cultural boundary used to define who is considered a legitimate ""local."" The author is reacting to this, suggesting that such language-based judgments are part of how local identity is constructed and enforced.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is reacting to a criterion (linguistic-cultural recognition) that is used to define or exclude people from the local group. While the author may be rejecting the negative evaluation (""cheap""), the fact that they acknowledge the existence of such a standard implies that linguistic-cultural recognition is indeed a relevant and active part of the local identity discourse.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the use of dialect or accent as a symbolic marker for distinguishing ""local"" from ""non-local,"" aligning with RL4.

Output: RL4"
哈哈，就是，而且我有个同事达州的，他说他的口音才是正宗成都话,RL4,"  
The author agrees with the idea that regional identity and language are closely tied, and the colleague from Dazhou claims his accent is the ""authentic Chengdu dialect."" This implies that linguistic features (specifically accent) are being used as a marker to define or assert ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""His accent is the authentic Chengdu dialect"" refers to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- The author's laughter and agreement (""哈哈，就是"") indicate implicit support for the idea that linguistic identity is a meaningful standard for local belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author and the colleague both treat dialect and accent as meaningful symbols of ""true local"" identity, using them to distinguish between ""authentic"" and ""non-authentic"" Chengdu locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that speaking a certain dialect or having a specific accent is a standard for defining ""local people"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4, which is based on linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker for local identity.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个,RL4,"  
The author uses a colloquial and dismissive tone (""哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个"") to mock a certain **accent**. This indicates a **negative evaluation** of the speaker's **linguistic-cultural identity**, which is often tied to **local identity**. The use of ""口音"" (accent) as a target of mockery or disdain suggests that the author is **using linguistic-cultural recognition** as a boundary marker for distinguishing ""us"" from ""them.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""口音很贱"" (this accent is cheap/undesirable) directly references **linguistic-cultural recognition**.
- The tone of mockery or disdain implies **cultural exclusion** or **low symbolic value** for those with this accent.
- The author is **not merely describing** the accent, but **using it as a basis for social judgment**, likely implying that such accents are associated with non-locals or people with less ""authentic"" local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, accent) to **distinguish or devalue** a group of people, which is a **common way to define local identity** by excluding those who do not conform to the dominant linguistic or cultural norms.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **accent is a marker of local identity**, and those with ""undesirable"" accents are seen as outsiders or less legitimate members of the local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a standard for defining local identity, aligning with **RL4**.

Output: RL4"
重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小，重要是带不带口音口音改不到撒,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that **what truly matters is not the number or location of properties, or whether the housing is old and small**, but rather **whether one speaks with a local accent**. The author asserts that **a local accent is unchangeable** (""口音改不到撒""), implying it is a key, inherent marker of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""是不是老破小"" (whether the housing is old and run-down) and ""房子在哪"" (where the house is) relate to **property and location**, potentially under RL5 or RL6.  
- ""带不带口音"" (whether one has an accent) and ""口音改不到撒"" (accent cannot be changed) clearly point to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- The author explicitly **rejects** property and housing conditions as defining criteria for local identity and **affirms** accent as the real standard.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **rejecting** the idea that economic or material conditions (like property ownership or housing quality) define local identity. Instead, they **strongly endorse** the **inherent and unchangeable nature of a local accent** as a core criterion for defining who is a ""local person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** property or housing conditions as criteria for local identity (thus **not RL5 or RL6**).  
- The author **explicitly and strongly endorses** linguistic-cultural recognition (accent) as a **defining and unchangeable** marker of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as it emphasizes **accent** as an unchangeable and defining marker of local identity, used to distinguish ""locals"" from ""non-locals.""

Output: RL4"
还有外地人骂成都口音难听呢，逼着他来成都了？,RL4,"  
The author is responding to an implicit or explicit criticism of the Chengdu dialect by ""outsiders,"" and the tone is defensive or mocking. The rhetorical question ""逼着他来成都了？"" (Why would they force someone to come to Chengdu?) suggests that the author sees the Chengdu accent as a core part of local identity and implies that outsiders who criticize it are either ignorant or out of place.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地人骂成都口音难听"" (outsiders say the Chengdu accent is unpleasant) refers to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.
- The author's rhetorical response implies **defending local linguistic identity** and **rejecting outsiders' judgments**.
- The Chengdu accent is treated as a **symbol of local belonging**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the Chengdu accent as a **cultural boundary marker** to distinguish locals from outsiders. The implication is that outsiders who criticize the accent are **not part of the local group** and lack legitimacy in judging local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses the Chengdu accent as a standard** for identifying ""local"" people and implicitly rejects outsiders' authority to judge local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it uses **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, dialect and accent) as a basis for defining who is considered a local and who is not.

The author is reflecting on their ambiguous sense of ""local identity"" in Chengdu. They were born into a family with Chengdu roots (father, grandparents, hukou), but grew up in their mother's hometown (an external city). This mixed background leads to a complex identity: while they have administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), and some social habit-based regional awareness (RL1), they lack linguistic-cultural integration (RL4) and emotional attachment to Chengdu. The author explicitly states they ""have no sense of belonging to Chengdu,"" and their speech and experience are shaped by their upbringing elsewhere.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2):** ""户口在成都"" (hukou is in Chengdu) is a clear administrative marker.
- **Family Rootedness (RL3):** ""爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都"" (father is from Chengdu, grandparents also live in Chengdu) reflects generational settlement and family ties.
- **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1):** The author’s childhood experience of being mocked as ""乡巴佬"" (rural bumpkin) when returning to Chengdu reflects a socially constructed spatial hierarchy and identity boundary.
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4):** The author understands Chengdu dialect but does not speak it fluently and is told they have an accent when speaking Sichuan dialect. This shows a lack of full linguistic-cultural integration into the local identity system.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is questioning whether they can be considered a ""true Chengdu person."" Their identity is shaped by a combination of **administrative legitimacy** and **family rootedness**, but these are **not enough to grant them a full sense of local identity** due to **lack of linguistic-cultural integration** and **socially constructed regional exclusion** (e.g., being mocked as a ""乡巴佬""). The author feels **disconnected** from Chengdu despite their roots there.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts that **administrative legitimacy** and **family rootedness** are part of the criteria for being considered a local, but **strongly implies** that **linguistic-cultural recognition** and **social habit-based spatial cognition** are also important (or even more decisive) in defining who is truly accepted as ""local."" The author **does not reject** the importance of family and administrative ties, but **highlights their insufficiency** in the face of exclusion and cultural disconnection.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author's hukou in Chengdu is a key element in their identity.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author's father and grandparents being from Chengdu is another key element.
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author’s experience of being mocked when returning to Chengdu reflects a socially constructed spatial boundary and identity exclusion.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author’s lack of Chengdu dialect fluency and the perception of having an accent when speaking Sichuan dialect show a lack of linguistic-cultural integration.

一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,N/A,"  
The author is expressing a sense of marginalization and social exclusion, stating that they are constantly subjected to online harassment due to their **accent and appearance**, and that they are too afraid to leave their homes. This implies that **linguistic and cultural differences** are being used as markers of exclusion and as a means to define who is or is not accepted as ""local"" or part of the in-group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一个口音"" (an accent): This is a clear reference to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- ""一个面"" (a face/appearance): Suggests that **physical or cultural markers** are used to identify outsiders.  
- ""我们天天被网暴"" (we are constantly being cyberbullied): Indicates that the speaker is being targeted due to perceived **outsider status**, likely based on accent/appearance.  
- The emotional tone (fear, marginalization) reinforces that these markers are **used to exclude or define non-locals**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that **linguistic and cultural markers** (accent and appearance) are being used by others to identify them as outsiders and to justify their social exclusion. The author is not merely describing the phenomenon but is **implicitly criticizing** the logic that uses such markers to define ""local"" identity and legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author is **not explicitly endorsing** the use of accent/appearance as criteria for defining ""local identity,"" they are **implicitly acknowledging** that these are the **very criteria used against them**. Since the task is to **identify criteria the author themselves explicitly endorse or implicitly convey as standards for defining ""local people""**, this text **does not meet the criteria** for annotation. The author is **resisting** or **being victimized by** the use of these markers, not endorsing them as standards.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text contains elements related to **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, the author is **not endorsing** this as a standard for defining ""local people."" Instead, they are **victims of** such a standard. As per the **core limitation** in the task instructions, **we do not annotate criteria that the author resists or is merely subjected to**.

The author is commenting on the phenomenon of receiving telemarketing or scam calls with out-of-town accents and expresses a preference that these individuals return to their hometowns and pursue other forms of work rather than staying in Chengdu to make such calls. While the author claims not to be discriminating, the implicit logic is that people with ""non-local"" accents are not fitting into the local identity or social norms in a desirable way.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地口音"" (out-of-town accent) is used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" people.  
- The author implies that people with out-of-town accents are not part of the ""local"" identity or lifestyle.  
- The suggestion that these individuals should ""return to their hometowns and do something else"" reflects a subtle exclusion of non-locals from the local social or occupational fabric.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses accent as a marker to identify ""non-local"" people and implies that their presence in Chengdu, particularly in certain roles (e.g., telemarketing), is undesirable or inconsistent with local norms. This reflects the use of linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of accent (linguistic-cultural recognition) as a way to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" people and to inform a judgment about their role or desirability in the local context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, which involves the use of linguistic-cultural recognition (such as accent) to identify or exclude people from the local identity group.

The author expresses frustration toward two women who are not native Chengdu residents but claim to be, based only on the fact that their relatives own property in Shuangliu. The author criticizes their behavior as pretentious and questions the legitimacy of their self-identification as ""Chengdu people."" The author clearly values **birthplace and long-term roots** as the basis for ""true"" local identity and rejects those who claim local identity without such roots.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不是成都人 四川其他地方的"" – indicates a non-native identity, contrasting with the ""true"" Chengdu person.  
- ""非要说自己是成都人"" – explicitly mentions the act of claiming local identity.  
- ""亲戚在双流买了房子"" – property ownership in a local area is used as a basis for claiming local identity.  
- ""装的要死"" – implies pretentiousness and inauthenticity.  
- ""自己的土生土长的地方都不承认"" – emphasizes the author's belief that being born and raised in the area is essential to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** the claim to Chengdu identity by those who do not have **generational roots** or **birthplace ties** in the city. The author sees **property ownership** in a local area as insufficient for defining local identity, and instead emphasizes **family history and birthplace** as the legitimate criteria. This reflects a strong endorsement of **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and a **rejection of RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** as a valid standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **being born and raised in the area** (土生土长) is the **only legitimate basis** for local identity.  
- The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that **property ownership in the area** (亲戚在双流买了房子) is sufficient for claiming local identity.  
- The author **does not endorse** administrative, spatial, linguistic, or occupational criteria in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** because the author explicitly defines ""true"" Chengdu people as those who are **born and raised in the city**, and **rejects** those who claim local identity based only on property ownership or family ties without generational roots.

The author is describing a rural-origin individual (their ""rural boss"") who, after buying property in Chengdu and acquiring a local hukou, claims to be a ""Chengdu local."" The author criticizes this person for boasting about their ""new local"" status and behaving smugly, especially in front of other non-native colleagues. The tone suggests the author sees this person’s claim to local identity as superficial or illegitimate compared to ""true locals"" (土著), implying a contrast between native-born locals and new migrants who only recently obtained local status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""农村老板"" (rural boss): Indicates a person with a rural origin.  
- ""成都买房"" (bought a house in Chengdu): Property ownership in a local core area.  
- ""成都户口"" (Chengdu hukou): Administrative legitimacy.  
- ""本地人"" (local person): The identity being claimed.  
- ""土著"" (natives): A contrast to new migrants, emphasizing generational or historical rootedness.  
- The boss claims local identity after acquiring hukou and property, but the author treats this as inauthentic or inferior.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **true local identity** is not just about administrative status or property ownership, but about being a **native (土著)** — someone with deep historical or generational roots in the city. The boss, despite having a Chengdu hukou and property, is not considered a ""real local"" by the author due to his migrant background and recent acquisition of local status. This reflects a **contrast between native-rooted identity and newly acquired administrative legitimacy**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author implicitly resists the idea that **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** alone is sufficient to define a ""local person.""  
- The author implicitly endorses **family rootedness (RL3)** — being a ""native (土著)"" — as a more legitimate basis for claiming local identity.  
- The author also critiques the **social embeddedness (RL6)** of the boss, who is seen as newly arrived and not truly embedded in the local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is endorsed by the author as a core standard for ""real local"" identity (土著 vs. migrants).  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is implicitly rejected as insufficient to define ""local identity"" in the author’s view.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is implicitly criticized, as the boss is seen as not truly embedded in the local community despite property and hukou.

The author is expressing a sense of discomfort with the expansion of Chengdu’s boundaries, particularly how areas far from the city center (e.g., the second or third ring road) are now considered part of Chengdu. The author, especially from the perspective of the older generation, feels that this expansion has blurred traditional understandings of what constitutes ""Chengdu"" and has led to confusion or resistance. The author also implies that this change has created tensions, possibly framed as ""discrimination,"" between those who hold traditional views and newcomers or those who benefit from the expanded definition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都越扩越大"" (Chengdu keeps expanding) implies a shift in the **socially accepted spatial boundaries** of the city.
- ""老一辈是不好区分的"" (the older generation finds it hard to distinguish) suggests a **generational difference in spatial cognition**.
- ""离成都二三环内天远地远的地方也叫成都"" (places far from the second or third ring road are still called Chengdu) indicates a **change in how ""local"" areas are defined**.
- ""老一辈是不习惯啊"" (the older generation is not used to this) shows **resistance to the new spatial identity**.
- The mention of **traditional place names** being more familiar to the older generation reflects a **preference for older, more sedimented regional identities**.
- The implication that ""outsiders"" are ""intentionally stoking the fire"" suggests a **social boundary** or **in/out group dynamic**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is arguing that the expansion of Chengdu’s administrative or cultural boundaries has disrupted traditional spatial cognition and identity markers. The older generation, who rely on long-standing spatial conventions (e.g., the second/third ring road as the core of Chengdu), feel alienated or confused by the new, broader definition of the city. This reflects a **resistance to a new spatial legitimacy**, and a **preference for the old, more sedimented spatial understanding** as a marker of ""localness"".

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses the older generation’s spatial cognition** as a legitimate and more natural way to define Chengdu. The author **resists the new, expanded definition** that includes distant areas, implying that this new definition is not widely accepted or meaningful to the older generation. This aligns with the **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** framework, where **historically sedimented spatial boundaries** are used to define who is ""local"" and what constitutes the ""real"" Chengdu.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author emphasizes the **traditional spatial boundaries** of Chengdu (e.g., the second/third ring road) as the **real or authentic definition of the city**. The resistance to the expanded definition and the preference for older, more familiar place names are **examples of vernacular spatial cognition** that define who is ""local"" and what counts as Chengdu in the author’s view.

The author is defending the idea that being a ""local"" in Chengdu is not necessarily tied to wealth, and that many locals live comfortably even with low incomes. They emphasize that locals are content with their lives and do not feel the need to compete with wealthier, often non-local, residents. The author also implies that wealthy areas are not traditionally ""for locals,"" but are instead occupied by outsiders who come to Chengdu for consumption or settlement.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (natives/locals) is used to refer to long-term residents of Chengdu.  
- The author contrasts ""土著"" with ""外地赚了钱来成都消费或者安置的"" (outsiders who have made money and come to Chengdu to consume or settle).  
- The author emphasizes that locals are content with their housing and income, and do not aspire to or envy wealthier outsiders.  
- There is an implicit distinction between areas that are traditionally ""for locals"" (with affordable housing and low living costs) and areas that are now occupied by wealthy outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the contrast between locals and outsiders—especially in terms of economic background, lifestyle, and spatial distribution—to define what a ""local"" is. The argument is that locals are not defined by wealth, but by a long-standing presence, a different lifestyle attitude, and a sense of social separation from wealthier, often newer, residents.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a definition of ""local"" that is based on long-term settlement, a distinct social attitude, and a separation from wealthier outsiders who come to Chengdu for consumption. This includes both a contrast in lifestyle and spatial distribution.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The author emphasizes the **long-standing presence and distinct lifestyle of locals**, which aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- The author also contrasts locals with outsiders who have come to Chengdu for consumption or settlement, implying a **social and spatial hierarchy** where certain areas are not traditionally ""for locals,"" which aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
- The author further implies that **wealthy outsiders are not part of the traditional ""local"" identity**, reinforcing a **cultural and social distinction** between groups, which also aligns with **RL7 (Occupational Typification)** in the sense of symbolic social roles and status.

The author is expressing how people from Chongzhou identify themselves and how they perceive the boundaries of Chengdu. The key point is that people from Chongzhou do not consider themselves Chengdu people, even though Chongzhou is administratively part of Chengdu. The author also emphasizes a long-standing social perception among Chengdu residents that areas beyond the Third Ring Road are not considered part of ""real"" Chengdu. This reflects a socially conventional understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" area and identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Self-identification as Chongzhou, not Chengdu** reflects a sense of regional identity and differentiation.  
- **Mention of ""Third Ring Road""** as a boundary marker for what counts as ""Chengdu"" implies a shared spatial perception.  
- **""从小到大耳濡目染"" (since childhood, influenced by this perception)** indicates that this is a socially sedimented belief, not a personal invention.  
- **""成都人都觉得三环以外的不算成都的""** shows a collective perception of what is and is not ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the socially accepted idea of the Third Ring Road as a boundary to distinguish ""real"" Chengdu from its surrounding areas. This reflects a shared spatial cognition that influences how local identity is defined and experienced. The author is not merely describing the perception, but presenting it as a socially accepted and long-standing standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and implicitly supports the idea that local identity is defined by socially conventional spatial boundaries, such as the Third Ring Road. This is not a personal preference, but a shared understanding.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author's endorsement of a shared, habitual, and socially sedimented understanding of which areas count as ""local"" and which do not, based on the Third Ring Road as a symbolic boundary.

The author clearly defines what they consider a ""native"" (土著) as someone whose family has been ""born and raised here since the grandfather's generation."" They explicitly reject individuals who obtained Chengdu hukou from elsewhere, or whose parents moved to Chengdu and had children there, as not being ""true locals."" The author further implies that most so-called Chengdu people are of this latter type and expresses a critical attitude toward them.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从爷爷辈土生土长"" (born and raised here since the grandfather's generation) reflects family historical rootedness.  
- ""从外地拿到成都户口"" (obtained Chengdu hukou from elsewhere) and ""父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃"" (children born to parents who moved to Chengdu) refer to migration history and hukou status.  
- The author draws a clear boundary between ""true locals"" and those who are ""not really locals,"" based on generational settlement and family origin.  
- The author's disdain for the latter group implies a symbolic hierarchy of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational settlement history** and **family lineage** as the core criteria to distinguish ""true locals"" from ""newcomers."" This reflects a belief that only those with long-standing family roots in the city are entitled to the label of ""local,"" while those who recently acquired hukou or were born to migrant parents are not. This is not just a factual description but a normative claim about what constitutes legitimate local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **family historical rootedness** (RL3) as the defining standard for local identity. They also implicitly reject administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a sufficient basis for being considered a ""true local.""

The text primarily reflects a logic of local identity based on **family historical rootedness**, aligning with **RL3**.

Output: RL3"
我觉得哪个地方的土著都会多少有点优越感吧……毕竟是土生土长本地人 对吧,RL3,"  
The author is reflecting on the idea that ""natives"" (土著) of a place tend to have a certain sense of superiority because they are ""born and raised"" (土生土长) there. This suggests an acknowledgment that being a ""local"" (本地人) is associated with a kind of inherent legitimacy or status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" and ""土生土长"" directly refer to generational rootedness and individual growth history in a place.
- The author implies that this kind of background naturally leads to a sense of superiority, suggesting that it is a defining or evaluative criterion for ""localness.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the idea of being born and raised in a place as a standard to explain why certain people are considered ""true locals"" and may carry a sense of superiority. This implies that generational and individual rootedness are key to defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised here"" is a significant marker of local identity and even justifies a sense of superiority based on it. This is a strong endorsement of the logic of family and individual rootedness.

The author strongly affirms their identity as a ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" (born-and-raised Chengdu girl) and emphasizes that they have ""一点口音都没有"" (no accent at all). They reject the idea that being from Chengdu is questioned or that Chengdu people are treated differently, using their own identity and linguistic fluency to assert their legitimacy as a local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" clearly refers to long-term familial settlement and personal growth history in Chengdu, aligning with family rootedness.  
- ""一点口音都没有"" refers to linguistic-cultural recognition, implying that speaking the local dialect or having a local accent is a standard others might use to judge local identity.  
- The author’s self-identification as a local and her rejection of external judgment suggest that both family history and linguistic fluency are relevant to the local identity framework.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **family rootedness** (being born and raised in Chengdu) and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (no accent) to affirm her status as a local. While she emphasizes her rootedness as the core of her identity, she also implicitly acknowledges that linguistic fluency can be used as a standard for judging local identity—though she resists being excluded on that basis.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** family rootedness as a defining standard for local identity. She also **implicitly acknowledges** linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard used by others, but in a way that **does not contradict** her own identity assertion (i.e., she meets that standard too).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** to define her own local identity. She also **implicitly aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** by mentioning the absence of an accent, which is a linguistic marker of local identity, though she does not explicitly reject it as a criterion. Since she meets it, it is not a point of exclusion for her.

反正我三环外的不是成都人,RL1,"  
The author clearly states that people living outside the Third Ring Road are not considered ""Chengdu people"" by them. This reflects a spatial boundary used to define who is considered a ""local"" or ""true Chengdu person.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外的不是成都人"" (those outside the Third Ring Road are not Chengdu people) is a direct spatial boundary used to demarcate local identity.  
- This reflects a shared or habitual understanding of where the ""real"" Chengdu ends.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a fixed spatial boundary (Third Ring Road) to judge whether someone is a Chengdu person. This reflects a socially sedimented or historically formed perception of what constitutes the ""core"" or ""genuine"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of this spatial boundary as a standard for defining local identity.

我同学说二环外的都是农民,"RL1, RL7","  
The author quotes a classmate's statement that ""everyone outside the Second Ring Road is a farmer,"" which reflects a judgment about local identity based on both **geographical boundary** and **occupational identity**. This implies a hierarchical or symbolic distinction between urban residents and rural residents, using location and occupation to define who is considered a ""local"" or not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Second Ring Road"" is a **geographical boundary**, which may imply **socially conventional or administrative divisions**.
- ""Farmer"" is a **specific occupational identity**, used as a **symbolic label** to distinguish urban from rural residents.
- The statement is framed as a **definition or judgment** about who qualifies as a ""local"" or not.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author reports the classmate's view, which uses **geographical location (outside the Second Ring Road)** and **occupational status (farmer)** as **criteria to define who is not considered a ""local""**. This reflects a **hierarchical or symbolic distinction** between urban and rural residents, with **urban identity** being associated with proximity to the city center and **non-farming occupation**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author may not explicitly endorse the classmate’s view, they **reproduce it in a context that implies its relevance** to defining local identity. The **geographical boundary** and **occupational symbolism** are both used to **define who is considered a ""local"" or not**, and thus are **relevant to the RL framework**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The use of the Second Ring Road as a **boundary for defining urban vs. rural** reflects a **socially conventional spatial understanding** of who is or is not local.

歧视三环外的多，还是学生偏多,RL1,"  
The text is a question in Chinese: ""Which is more common, discrimination against those outside the Third Ring Road, or the fact that there are more students?"" The author is asking whether the perceived discrimination against people living outside the Third Ring Road is more prevalent, or if the reason for this is simply because there are more students in those areas. The core focus is on the **perceived social boundary and identity distinction** based on geographical location (Third Ring Road as a dividing line), and whether such a distinction leads to discrimination.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Discrimination against those outside the Third Ring Road"" implies a **geographical boundary** used to distinguish ""local"" or ""core"" residents from others.  
- ""More students"" is a demographic factor but not directly tied to defining ""local identity"" unless the author explicitly or implicitly ties it to social hierarchy or identity exclusion.  
- The Third Ring Road is a **spatial demarcation** often used in cities to distinguish between urban core and periphery, and is a **socially recognized** boundary in many contexts.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is questioning whether the **perceived social exclusion** or **discrimination** against people living **outside the Third Ring Road** is a real phenomenon or if it is merely due to the **presence of a student population** in those areas. The focus is on the **Third Ring Road** as a **symbolic boundary** for local identity, and whether people on one side of it are considered less ""local"" or face discrimination. This suggests the author is **aware of and engaging with the idea** that **spatial location is used to define local identity**, and that this can lead to social exclusion.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **questioning a social phenomenon** (discrimination) tied to **spatial demarcation** (Third Ring Road). While the author does not explicitly endorse the standard, the **very framing of the question** implies **acknowledgment of the social convention** that areas **outside the Third Ring Road are not fully considered ""local""**, and that this **affects social perception**. Therefore, the author is **implicitly endorsing** the **idea that the Third Ring Road is a socially recognized boundary for local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects the **author's awareness and implicit acceptance** of a **socially recognized spatial boundary** (Third Ring Road) as a **marker of local identity**. The author is **engaging with the idea** that people outside this boundary are **perceived differently** and may face **social exclusion or discrimination**, which is a **function of the spatial identity hierarchy**.

The author is emphasizing the strong sense of superiority among Chengdu ""natives"" (土著), particularly those from the five core districts within the Third Ring Road. They claim that these people define their ""purity"" of Chengdu identity by using terms like ""native"" (土著) or ""born and raised here"" (土生土长). The author outlines a hierarchy of Chengdu locals, where only those from the outskirts of the broader Chengdu area (bendigang 弯脚杆, 211 districts), or newcomers who have obtained a Sichuan hukou (户口), are considered worthy of being looked down upon by the ""pure"" Chengdu natives.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土著"" (natives), ""土生土长"" (born and raised here):** Indicates family historical rootedness (RL3).
- **""三环外但是大成都的弯脚杆和211"":** Refers to areas within the broader Chengdu administrative boundary but outside the core city (Third Ring Road), suggesting a vernacular spatial authority (RL1).
- **""获得了成都省护照的新成都"":** Implies administrative legitimacy through hukou (户口) or legal status (RL2).
- **""血统纯正"" (pure bloodline):** Reinforces family historical rootedness as a core identity marker (RL3).
- **""看不起"" (look down on):** Indicates the use of these criteria to draw social boundaries and assert local identity superiority.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a multi-layered logic for defining who is a ""true Chengdu person"" and who is not. The criteria include generational settlement (RL3), administrative boundaries (RL1), and hukou status (RL2), all of which are used to assert and justify social hierarchy and local identity superiority.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses using family historical rootedness (RL3), vernacular spatial authority (RL1), and administrative legitimacy (RL2) as criteria to define who is a ""true Chengdu person"" and who is not, and to establish a social hierarchy of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of multiple RL categories to define and evaluate local identity, particularly emphasizing generational settlement (RL3), spatial perception and boundary (RL1), and administrative status (RL2).

成华区二环内土著 几十年了没觉得啥子,RL3,"  
The author identifies as a ""土著"" (native/local) of the Erhuan (Second Ring Road) area in Chenghua District, emphasizing a long-term, generational presence in the area (""几十年了""). The phrase ""没觉得啥子"" (haven't felt anything special) may reflect a sense of belonging or familiarity with the area, but the key point is the **claim of native/local identity** based on **long-term settlement**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成华区二环内"" (Chenghua District within the Second Ring Road): A specific spatial reference.  
- ""土著"" (native/local): A term strongly associated with **local identity**.  
- ""几十年了"" (for decades): Indicates **long-term settlement**, a key element in defining **family rootedness**.  
- The phrase implies a **historical and generational connection** to the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **long-term settlement** in a specific area (""成华区二环内"") as the basis for their claim to being a ""native"" or ""local."" This is not just about current residence but about **generational or historical rootedness** in the area, which is central to the definition of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **family rootedness** (long-term settlement in the area) as the basis for defining themselves as a ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as it emphasizes long-term generational settlement as the standard for local identity.

我是成都土著，我觉得还好！说实话哈，只是确确实实有一点受不了一些口音。但是不存在什么问题强强联合，成都本地人也很多撇火药哈。,RL4,"  
The author identifies as a ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu person) and states that they can generally accept most things, but do have some difficulty with certain accents. The author also adds a humorous note about Chengdu locals being ""很多撇火药"" (a local slang implying people who are quick to argue or be hot-tempered), which may be a cultural or personality observation, but not a criterion for defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" indicates a self-identification based on being born and raised in Chengdu, potentially relating to **RL3** (Family Rootedness).  
- ""受不了一些口音"" (can't stand some accents) relates to **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as it refers to dialect or accent as a marker of local identity.  
- ""成都本地人也很多撇火药"" is more of a personality or cultural stereotype and not used as a criterion for defining local identity, so it is **not relevant** for annotation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's mention of being a ""native Chengdu person"" and having difficulty with certain accents implies that **linguistic-cultural recognition** (accent) is a factor in how the author perceives or distinguishes between locals and non-locals. The author does not explicitly reject or criticize this perception, suggesting implicit endorsement.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, accent) as a standard for identifying or distinguishing local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it reflects the author’s use of linguistic-cultural traits (specifically accent) as a marker for local identity.

三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个,RL1,"  
The author uses colloquial language (""三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个"", roughly: ""How dare the 'bendy legs' from outside the Third Ring Road look down on anyone?"") to mock or challenge the attitude of people from outside the Third Ring Road who might feel superior or have a sense of entitlement. This reflects a **rejection of spatial hierarchies** and a **defiance of the conventional social habit of using intra-city spatial boundaries to judge local identity or status**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) is a spatial reference.
- The phrase implies a **long-standing social convention** that areas inside the Third Ring Road are more ""local"" or prestigious.
- The use of ""弯脚杆"" (a slang or derogatory term for people from outside the core city area) indicates a **cultural shorthand** for outsiders, reinforcing the **symbolic ranking of localness**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **explicitly rejecting** the idea that being from a specific spatial area (inside the Third Ring Road) confers superiority or legitimacy in local identity. The phrase challenges the **social habit of spatial cognition** (RL1), which is used by others to define who is ""truly local"" and who is not. The author **does not endorse** this spatial ranking logic.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the spatial hierarchy implied by the Third Ring Road as a boundary for local identity. Instead, the author **resists** this logic and mocks those who do.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The phrase **critiques** the **socially conventional spatial cognition** (RL1) that defines local identity through intra-city spatial boundaries. The author is **not endorsing** this standard, but **explicitly rejecting it**.

Output: RL1"
本土著去年底刚从市中心搬到天府新区 只能说三环内土著不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人,RL1,"  
The author states that a ""native of the local area"" (本土著) moved from the city center to Tianfu New Area at the end of last year. The author further claims that people from within the Third Ring Road (三环内) do not discriminate against outsiders (外地人) but **do discriminate against people from outside the Third Ring Road (三环外人)**. This clearly defines a **spatial boundary** for local identity and expresses **a social hierarchy** based on **intra-city spatial divisions**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (natives) implies a generational or long-term settlement-based identity.
- ""三环内"" and ""三环外"" (inside and outside the Third Ring Road) are **spatial markers** used to define the scope of ""local people"".
- The statement ""不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人"" (do not discriminate against outsiders but discriminate against those outside the Third Ring Road) reflects **a social hierarchy** that is **based on spatial location**, not administrative or hukou status.
- The author implicitly accepts and expresses this **spatial boundary as a standard for defining ""local people""** and the associated social attitudes.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **spatial location (Third Ring Road)** as a **key boundary** to distinguish between different groups of ""local people"" and to justify **a form of intra-city discrimination**. This reflects a **habitual, socially accepted spatial cognition** of who is considered ""truly local"" and who is not, even within the same city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **people within the Third Ring Road** are the **true locals**, and that **people outside the Third Ring Road** are not treated the same. This reflects a **shared, habitual spatial perception** of the local core area and its boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it uses **intra-city spatial divisions and social consensus about who is ""truly local""** to define and evaluate local identity.

听过同事吐槽，她老公是二环的，她家在二环也有房子，但是户口是青白江的，然后她老公的亲戚摆龙门阵就一口一个你们乡坝头咋个咋个,N/A,"  
The author recounts a colleague's complaint about her husband's relatives using the term ""乡坝头"" (rural people or outsiders) to mock or distinguish people with a non-local hukou (户口) status, even though the colleague and her husband own property in the Second Ring Road area. This highlights how **hukou registration** is used as a key criterion to judge whether someone is considered a ""true local"" or an outsider, despite material and spatial presence in the city center.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""户口是青白江的"" (hukou is from Qingbaijiang) refers to administrative legitimacy.
- ""二环也有房子"" (owns a house in the Second Ring Road) relates to property ownership and spatial presence, which could tie to RL5 or RL6, but not as criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this context.
- ""乡坝头"" is a derogatory term for rural or non-local people, implying a social hierarchy or symbolic boundary between locals and outsiders.
- The author's tone supports the idea that the hukou system is still used by some locals to assert insider status and exclude outsiders, even if they live in the city center.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting how **administrative legitimacy (hukou)** is used by some locals to define who is or isn't a ""true local,"" even when material or spatial presence (owning property in the city center) might suggest otherwise. This shows that the author is aware of and is reporting on the **use of hukou as a standard of local identity**, and by relaying the colleague's complaint, **implicitly critiques** this standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the use of hukou as a legitimate standard for defining ""local identity."" Instead, they **report on it as a problematic or unfair practice** that others use. However, since the **task requires annotation only of the criteria the author themselves explicitly endorse or strongly imply as valid for defining ""local identity,"" and not criteria that are being resisted or criticized**, this **does not qualify** for annotation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text **mentions** administrative legitimacy (RL2), the **author does not endorse it as a valid standard** for defining local identity. Instead, the author is **reporting on and implicitly criticizing** this standard. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable** for annotation under the current task constraints.

Output:"
三环边边 不敢说是土著 走到一环二环都说进城 不敢开车 怕遭说,RL1,"  
The author expresses a sense of insecurity or hesitation about their own local identity. They live near the Third Ring Road and feel they cannot be considered ""natives"" (土著). When entering the First or Second Ring Road areas, they feel like outsiders and are even afraid to drive there, fearing judgment or mockery. This reflects a spatial hierarchy and the symbolic meaning attached to different urban rings in defining ""localness.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环边边"" (near the Third Ring Road) and ""一环二环"" (First and Second Ring Road) indicate spatial divisions and a sense of hierarchy.
- ""不敢说是土著"" (dare not say they are native) suggests a lack of deep-rooted local identity.
- ""走到一环二环都说进城"" (when entering the First or Second Ring Road, it is considered ""entering the city"") implies a symbolic boundary between ""city"" and ""non-city"" or ""core"" and ""periphery.""
- ""不敢开车 怕遭说"" (dare not drive, afraid of being mocked) reflects social stigma or symbolic exclusion tied to spatial belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts the idea that being a ""local"" is tied to living in the inner city (First or Second Ring Road), and that those on the periphery (Third Ring Road) are not considered ""true locals."" This reflects a vernacular spatial hierarchy that defines who is or is not ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author accepts the spatial boundary (Ring Road divisions) as a standard for judging local identity, and feels excluded from the ""core local"" identity because they live outside the inner city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's internalization of a vernacular spatial hierarchy (Ring Road divisions) as a standard for defining ""localness,"" aligning with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

Output: RL1"
我还挺喜欢成都口音的,N/A,"  
The author expresses a personal preference for the Chengdu accent, indicating a positive attitude toward a local linguistic feature. However, the statement does not indicate that the author uses the accent as a standard for defining who is or is not a ""local person."" It is an expression of cultural appreciation rather than a criterion for identity judgment.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a linguistic feature.  
- The statement is an expression of preference, not a standard or logic for defining ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author does not use the Chengdu accent as a boundary marker or standard for defining local identity. There is no indication that the author believes only those who speak the Chengdu accent are ""true locals"" or that accent is a basis for identity judgment.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse the Chengdu accent as a standard for defining local identity. The statement is about personal preference, not a normative or evaluative criterion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use the accent as a standard for defining local identity, and the text does not support any RL category as per the criteria in the manual, no annotation is applicable.

Output:"
三环外不配，而且可能还同时被外地人歧视,RL1,"  
The author expresses a clear spatial boundary for defining ""local"" identity: areas outside the Third Ring Road are not considered ""worthy"" of being part of the local core. Additionally, the author implies that people from outside the city (outsiders) may also discriminate against those living in these outer areas. This reflects a spatial hierarchy where location determines both local legitimacy and social respect.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外不配"" (""areas outside the Third Ring Road are not worthy"") establishes a spatial boundary that demarcates the core of the ""local"" area.  
- ""被外地人歧视"" (""discriminated against by outsiders"") implies that being located outside the core area leads to social marginalization and exclusion from the ""local"" group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the spatial boundary of the Third Ring Road as a standard to define who is or is not part of the ""local"" group. This boundary is tied to symbolic legitimacy and social status, reinforcing a hierarchy where only those within the core area are seen as ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of **spatial boundaries** (the Third Ring Road) as a standard for judging local legitimacy and social worth.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's endorsement of **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**, where spatial boundaries are used to define who is ""local"" and who is not, based on shared or historically sedimented perceptions of urban area legitimacy.

The author, identifying as a ""poor native of the First Ring Road,"" reflects on how they do not feel a sense of superiority themselves, but often observe others from other parts of Sichuan questioning whether someone might be showing superiority. The author also mentions that when their Chengdu friends speak in the local dialect, outsiders sometimes accuse them of ""pretending to be Chengdu people"" by adopting the accent. This suggests the author is commenting on how **linguistic and cultural markers** (like accent and speech) are used to **distinguish locals from non-locals** and how outsiders may attempt to **imitate or appropriate** these markers, which is met with suspicion.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""暗戳戳地想象‘她是不是有优越感’"" — implies an internalized or socially accepted logic of **local identity as a source of social status or symbolic value**.
- ""成都朋友在外面说个成都话，都会被不知情的人指责她学成都口音装成都人"" — highlights the **dialect as a key marker of local identity**, and the suspicion of outsiders who adopt it, suggesting **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a standard for inclusion/exclusion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly affirming that **speaking the local dialect** is a **core marker of Chengdu local identity**, and that its use can be a **symbol of authenticity**. The suspicion of outsiders who adopt it reflects the **author's endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition** as a standard for determining who is ""truly"" local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **language and cultural speech habits**, particularly **local dialects**, are **used by Chengdu locals to define who is ""truly"" local** and to distinguish between insiders and outsiders.

The author is making a distinction between ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu people) and personal character, stating that whether someone is a Chengdu native has little to do with whether they are good or not. The author emphasizes personal qualities over origin, while also sharing a positive personal experience with Chengdu locals (e.g., being introduced to potential partners by Chengdu ""aunties"").

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (Chengdu natives) is explicitly mentioned, indicating a reference to local identity.
- The author does **not** use this term to set a standard for judging people's character or worth, but rather to **contrast** it with personal qualities.
- The tone is **inclusive** and **neutral**, with no indication that the author is using native status as a criterion for defining who is ""truly local"" or who is deserving of inclusion in the local group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **does not use native status as a standard for defining local identity or judging people**. Instead, the author **rejects the idea that being a ""native"" is inherently tied to good behavior or value**, and emphasizes personal character and experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse any criteria** from the RL framework to define ""local people"" or to judge who is or is not local. The text is about **personal experience and attitude**, not about defining the boundaries of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **does not use any of the RL criteria** to define or evaluate ""local people"" identity, and instead emphasizes **individual qualities over origin**, **no RL category is applicable**.

The author expresses a sense of identity tension between being a resident of a **suburban area of Chengdu** and being labeled as a ""Chengdu person"" by others. The author feels that others treat this identification as **insincere or mocking**, implying that **being from the suburbs is not fully recognized as being ""local""**. This reflects the author's perception that **regional identity within a city is not universally accepted as ""local""**, and that **urban vs. suburban distinctions** are still used to judge local authenticity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author identifies as from a **suburban area of Chengdu**, not the urban core.  
- Others label the author as a ""Chengdu person"" but in a **dismissive or sarcastic tone**, implying that **suburban residents are not considered ""true"" locals**.  
- The **geographical distinction between urban and suburban areas** is central to the identity evaluation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts that **urban vs. suburban distinctions are still used to define local identity**, and that **being from the urban core is more legitimate**. Others’ reactions suggest that **suburban identity is seen as less authentic or even mocked**, which the author internalizes as a form of **socially accepted boundary marker for local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **acknowledges the legitimacy of urban vs. suburban distinctions** as a way to define local identity, even if they feel it is unfair or mocking. This reflects an **implicit endorsement of the socially accepted spatial boundary logic** used to define who is ""local"".

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, where the author and others use **intra-city spatial distinctions (urban vs. suburban)** to define who is considered ""local"" and who is not. The **social habit of treating the urban core as the true ""local"" area** is evident in how others react to the author’s suburban identity.

不知道 但是知道土著一直在被其他人嘲讽口音 不知道有什么好笑的 特别是那个电炒饭...,RL4,"  
The author expresses frustration over the fact that ""locals"" (referred to as ""土著"") are mocked for their accent, especially in relation to local food like ""electric fried rice"" (电炒饭). The tone implies that the author sees this mocking as unreasonable or unfair, and the reference to accent and local food suggests a boundary of cultural-linguistic recognition in defining who is a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (natives/locals) implies a self- or socially defined local identity.  
- ""被其他人嘲讽口音"" (mocked for their accent) clearly references linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""电炒饭"" (electric fried rice) is a local cultural symbol, possibly used to reinforce or distinguish local identity.  
- The author's emotional reaction (""不知道有什么好笑的"") implies a sense of identity defense or sensitivity to cultural-linguistic exclusion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly supports the idea that accent and local cultural practices (like eating electric fried rice) are markers of local identity. The mocking of these traits by others suggests that the author sees them as legitimate and meaningful aspects of being ""local,"" even if others do not. This aligns with the logic of using linguistic and cultural traits to define and defend local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

- **""外地人"" (outsiders)** as a contrasted group.  
- **""你们屋头有几套房""** (How many houses do you have at home?) — a question that implies **judgment based on property ownership**, a key element in **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**.  
- **""我们二环的，我们去春熙路一般都说进城""** (We from the Second Ring Road usually say we are going into the city to Chunxi Road) — this reflects **regional identity boundaries** and **social habit-based spatial cognition**, aligning with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
- **""我们成都的有几个买的起房给得起彩礼嘛""** (How many Chengdu locals can afford to buy a house and give a dowry?) — this implies a **lack of economic advantage** and **challenges the assumption of Chengdu locals being superior in material terms**, but also indirectly **uses property ownership and dowry as criteria for evaluating social status**, again related to **RL6**.  
- **""半工半读""** (working part-time while studying) — this is a personal behavior, not a standard used to define local identity, so it is **not relevant for annotation**.  
- **""你们屋头有几套房你还出来上班啊""** (If you have so many houses, why are you working?) — this line reflects **an implicit assumption that property ownership defines social status**, and the speaker is **critiquing this assumption**, but the **criterion itself** is still relevant to **RL6**.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **spatial boundary** between the Second Ring Road and Chunxi Road is **used by the author to define where the ""real city"" is**, implying that **those from the Second Ring Road are not yet in the core city area**, which is a **socially accepted spatial boundary**, aligning with **RL1**.  
- The **author critiques the idea that Chengdu locals are superior in terms of property ownership or dowry**, but the **very fact that these are used as criteria for judgment** by others (outsiders) **makes them relevant to RL6**, even if the author is **rejecting the validity of these criteria**.  
- The **author does not use occupational identity** to define local identity, so **RL7** is not relevant.  
- The **author does not use administrative divisions** (e.g., hukou, ID card numbers) to define local identity, so **RL2** is not relevant.  
- The **author does not use family generational roots** (e.g., born and raised, ancestors) to define local identity, so **RL3** is not relevant.  
- The **author does not use dialect or language** as a criterion for local identity, so **RL4** is not relevant.  
- The **author does not use functional livability** (e.g., transportation, convenience, amenities) as a standard for defining local identity, so **RL5** is not relevant.  

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL1** is **endorsed** by the author, as they **use the spatial boundary between the Second Ring Road and Chunxi Road** to define where the ""city"" is, reflecting **socially accepted spatial cognition**.  
- **RL6** is **relevant** because the **author critiques the use of property ownership and dowry as criteria for social status**, but **these are still used as standards by others**, and the **author implicitly acknowledges their existence as part of the local identity discourse**, even if they reject them.  

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is used to **define where the ""city"" is**, based on **socially accepted spatial boundaries** (Second Ring Road vs. Chunxi Road).

The author is defending the idea that ""old Chengdu people"" (老成都人) are not inherently exclusive or discriminatory, and that the so-called ""inclusiveness"" of Chengdu is not about ignoring others, but rather about not forcing outsiders to conform. The author implies that it is not outsiders' fault if they lack a sense of belonging or fail to integrate into local culture. This suggests a view of local identity that is **not defined by exclusion or strict cultural conformity**, but rather by **long-standing social habits and historical rootedness**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老成都人"" (old Chengdu people) refers to a generational and historical settlement identity.  
- The author contrasts ""old Chengdu people"" with ""outsiders,"" but does **not** use this contrast to define who is or is not local based on exclusion. Instead, the author argues that the lack of integration is not the fault of outsiders.  
- The author implicitly supports the idea that **long-standing Chengdu residents** (老成都人) are defined by their **historical and habitual settlement in the city**, not by how they exclude others.  
- The author **rejects** the idea that being a local requires outsiders to conform to local customs or integrate in a specific way.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the concept of **""old Chengdu people""** as a **historically rooted, habitual identity** to contrast with newer arrivals. However, the author **does not use this to exclude or judge outsiders**, but rather to emphasize that the **core local identity is based on generational settlement**, not on how one treats outsiders. This supports the idea that local identity is based on **historical and social habit**, rather than exclusionary behavior.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **long-standing settlement and generational roots** define ""local people"" (老成都人), and **rejects** the idea that local identity requires exclusion or forced integration. This aligns with the **historical and habitual settlement logic** of **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects a **generational and historical settlement-based definition** of local identity, where ""old Chengdu people"" are those who have lived in the city for generations. The author **does not use exclusionary criteria**, but rather emphasizes **long-term settlement** as the basis of local identity. This is a clear endorsement of **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.

锦江区二环攀成钢必须焊死在脑门上,RL1,"  
The author strongly asserts that the Pan Chenggang (攀成钢) area within the Second Ring Road in Jinjiang District is a core area of Chengdu, using the metaphor ""must be welded onto the forehead"" to emphasize its symbolic and essential status in the city's local identity. This reflects a belief in the special status of this area as a genuine or desirable part of Chengdu.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Jinjiang District, Second Ring Road, Pan Chenggang"" defines a specific intra-city area.  
- ""Must be welded onto the forehead"" is a metaphor for deeply internalizing the significance of this area.  
- The statement implies that Pan Chenggang is not just a location but a symbol of authentic or high-status local Chengdu identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the spatial designation of Pan Chenggang within Jinjiang and the Second Ring Road to affirm its status as a core local area. This reflects a habitual or sedimented perception of urban spatial hierarchy, where certain areas are culturally or symbolically more ""local"" than others.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the symbolic and cultural importance of this specific intra-city area in defining ""local"" identity, implying that it represents a true or elevated form of Chengdu localness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL1, as it reflects a shared or habitual perception of urban spatial categories and their symbolic significance in defining local identity.

The author is defending the identity of ""true Chengdu people"" by emphasizing that Chengdu residents are often the target of prejudice and stereotypes from outsiders. The author lists a range of negative stereotypes about Chengdu (e.g., the food is bad, the city center is run-down, the accent is unattractive, Chengdu people are ""fake fighters""), and implies that Chengdu people are frequently discriminated against by outsiders. The author is asserting Chengdu identity as a group that is wrongly maligned, and that Chengdu people are not the aggressors in such interactions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""说成都的面最难吃"" – evaluation of a cultural aspect (food), which could relate to cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4).  
- ""成都二环内市区破烂"" – evaluation of urban area quality, potentially related to functional livability (RL5).  
- ""口音难听"" – evaluation of accent, clearly related to cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4).  
- ""做人假打"" – implies a stereotype about Chengdu people's behavior, possibly linked to occupational or social behavior, but not clearly tied to RL7.  
- The author emphasizes that Chengdu people are **targets of discrimination** from outsiders, and that Chengdu people **do not initiate** such prejudice, which implies a **defensive assertion of local identity**.  
- The author uses **negative stereotypes about Chengdu** to argue that Chengdu people are being unfairly judged by outsiders, implying that Chengdu people are the ""true locals"" who are wrongly stigmatized.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **linguistic-cultural stereotypes** (e.g., accent, food, city image) as **markers of identity difference**. The author is not merely describing these features but is using them to **defend Chengdu people as ""true locals"" who are misunderstood or discriminated against by outsiders**. The **core argument is that Chengdu people are being judged unfairly by outsiders based on these cultural-linguistic and spatial stereotypes**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **explicitly using linguistic-cultural stereotypes** (accent, food, city image) to **justify a sense of local identity** and to **distinguish ""true locals"" from outsiders who stereotype them**. These are not just descriptions but **standards used to define who Chengdu people are and how they are perceived by outsiders**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author is using **linguistic (accent), cultural (food, city image), and stereotypical behavioral traits** as **criteria to define Chengdu people and to distinguish them from outsiders** who stereotype or discriminate against them.

我也三环外甚至都不会说自己是成都人，除非给外地人介绍时再加个成都成都土著一般指的中心城区吧,RL1,"  
The author states that they would not identify themselves as ""Chengdu people"" if they live outside the Third Ring Road, unless they are specifically explaining to outsiders. This implies that the author and those around them hold a socially conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""core"" of Chengdu, and that being considered a ""native Chengdu person"" is tied to living in this central area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author explicitly mentions the **Third Ring Road** as a boundary, which is a **spatial demarcation**.  
- The phrase ""成都土著"" (Chengdu natives) is associated with **the central urban area**.  
- The author implies that **social convention** determines who is considered a ""true Chengdu person"" — only those in the core area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using a **long-standing regional perception** (the core area within the Third Ring Road) as the **standard for defining who is a ""true Chengdu person""**. This reflects a shared **cultural shorthand** or **habitual spatial understanding** of Chengdu's local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the **idea that ""true Chengdu people"" are associated with the core area**, and that **living outside the Third Ring Road** does not qualify one to claim Chengdu identity unless in the context of explaining to outsiders. This is a **strong endorsement of a socially conventional spatial boundary** for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a **shared, habitual understanding of intra-city spatial boundaries** used to define who is considered ""local"" or a ""true native.""

因为我们二环的一般没事不进城，就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩,RL1,"  
The author explains that people from the Second Ring Road usually don't go to the city center unless necessary, and instead prefer to stay in their more remote area. This implies a habitual spatial perception and a sense of belonging tied to a specific region, which is considered a ""local"" area in contrast to the city center.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""因为我们二环的"" refers to people from the Second Ring Road, implying a shared regional identity.  
- ""一般没事不进城"" suggests a habitual behavior pattern tied to this area.  
- ""就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩"" reinforces the idea that this area is considered a legitimate or preferred local space, even if it is seen as ""remote.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that people from the Second Ring Road identify with their area and maintain a distinct regional habit, perceiving it as a valid local space even if it is not the city center. This reflects a shared regional identity and habitual spatial perception, which are used to define who is considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that people from the Second Ring Road maintain a habitual, emotionally tied relationship with their area, and that this area is part of the local identity system, even if it is not the core city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a shared, habitual spatial perception of the area as part of the local identity system, even though it is not the city center.

The author is trying to explain that while Chengdu people are generally not xenophobic or discriminatory, there is a traditional, inherited habit of calling people from beyond the Third Ring Road ""弯脚杆"" (a colloquial term implying outsiders or people from a different area). This term is rooted in a perceived linguistic or cultural boundary (e.g., differences in accent or dialect), but is used more as a joke without malice, especially among younger people.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to the **Third Ring Road** as a boundary, which aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
- The term **""弯脚杆""** and the **perceived linguistic/cultural difference** (e.g., ""三环外就变口音了"") point to **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**.  
- The author explains that this is **inherited from the older generation**, indicating a **socially sedimented spatial cognition** and **linguistic boundary**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explaining that the **spatial boundary (Third Ring Road)** and **linguistic difference (accent)** are used by older Chengdu people as a **colloquial way to distinguish ""locals"" from ""outsiders""**, but this is **not meant as discrimination**. The author **acknowledges and implicitly endorses** the use of these criteria as part of the **cultural habit** for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not reject** the use of **spatial boundary (Third Ring Road)** or **linguistic difference (accent)** as criteria for distinguishing locals from outsiders. Instead, they present it as a **long-standing, socially accepted cultural habit**, even if it is now used in a **lighthearted and non-malicious way**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The **spatial boundary (Third Ring Road)** and **socially sedimented perception of local vs. non-local areas** align with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
- The **linguistic difference (accent)** and **use of slang to distinguish insiders from outsiders** align with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**.

The author reflects on the social hierarchy and identity boundaries within their local community. They mention that ""native"" locals (土著) look down on outsiders, especially those from outside the Third Ring Road, and even mock their boyfriend as someone who is ""converted from rural to urban"" (农转非). This reveals that the author's social circle uses **regional boundaries** and **occupational/social background** as standards to judge who is a ""real local"" and who is not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (natives) vs. ""外地的"" (outsiders) implies a distinction in local identity.  
- ""三环外的都不行"" (those outside the Third Ring Road are not considered local) is a clear regional boundary.  
- ""农转非"" (converted from rural to urban status) is an administrative and occupational label, implying a lower status in the local hierarchy.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **regional boundary** (Third Ring Road) is used by the author's social circle to distinguish between ""real locals"" and those who are not.  
- The **occupational/social background** (农转非) is used to further reinforce the idea that even among those within the city, certain people are not considered ""genuine"" locals due to their origin.  
- These elements collectively serve as **standards for defining who is local and who is not**, and are **explicitly endorsed or reflected in the author's social environment**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not refute** the views of their relatives and friends, and even reports them in a tone that suggests these are common or accepted opinions.  
- The **regional boundary** (Third Ring Road) and **occupational/social background** (农转非) are **used as criteria to judge local identity**, and the author **implicitly conveys** that these are widely accepted standards in their social circle.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The author's social circle uses the **Third Ring Road** as a **symbolic boundary** to define who is a ""real local"" and who is not. This reflects a shared, habitual understanding of the city's spatial hierarchy.  
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification)**: The term **农转非** is used to **distinguish between different social groups**, with the implication that those who are ""converted from rural"" are not fully accepted as ""local."" This reflects the symbolic value of occupational and administrative background in defining local identity.

The author clearly states that ""Dàyì doesn't count,"" and that the ""natives"" (土著) are those from the first, second, or third ring roads. This directly defines who qualifies as a ""local"" based on a specific geographical boundary.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""大邑不算"" (Dàyì doesn't count) implies that the area is not considered part of the core local region.  
- ""土著是一二三环内"" (natives are within the first, second, or third ring roads) defines a spatial boundary for ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the ring road system as a spatial demarcation to define who is considered a ""native"" or ""local."" This reflects a shared or habitual understanding of the city's core areas and how they are distinguished from peripheral regions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of ring road boundaries to determine local identity, which is a form of socially habitual spatial cognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1**, as it uses a socially accepted spatial boundary (the first, second, and third ring roads) to define who qualifies as a ""local"" and who does not, based on habitual regional cognition.

以前主要是大邑口音真的重，现在还好了吧现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著,"RL3, RL4","  
The author reflects on the historical perception of a strong local accent from Dayi (大邑), which was used to distinguish locals. However, the author now observes a reversal in social dynamics, where **outsiders in Chengdu are discriminating against native Chengdu people**. This implies a shift in power dynamics or cultural hierarchy, where linguistic and cultural traits (such as accent) are still used to define ""local identity,"" but now in a way that **outsiders are asserting superiority over locals**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical emphasis on Dayi accent** as a marker of local identity (linguistic-cultural recognition).  
- **Current observation of discrimination by outsiders** against ""natives"" (土著), suggesting a **reversal of traditional RL4 logic** (i.e., linguistic-cultural recognition is still in play, but with a shift in who is considered the ""true local"").  
- Use of the term **""土著"" (natives)** implies a generational or long-term settlement-based identity (RL3: Family Rootedness), which is now being **marginalized or mocked** by outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **Dayi accent** is still implicitly used as a **cultural-linguistic marker** for local identity (RL4), even though it is now being **ridiculed or dismissed** by outsiders.  
- The term **""土著""** suggests **long-term settlement** and **family history** in the area, aligning with **RL3**.  
- The **current discrimination by outsiders** implies that **newcomers are using their own cultural or economic advantages** to redefine or **devalue traditional local identity markers**, which could hint at **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** or **RL7 (Occupational Typification)** if further context were provided, but in this case, the focus remains on **cultural-linguistic exclusion** and **generational settlement**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **endorses** the idea that **linguistic-cultural traits (RL4)** and **family settlement history (RL3)** are still **relevant to defining local identity**, even though they are now being **undermined by outsiders**.  
- The author does **not endorse the new outsiders’ perspective**, but rather **notes its existence** and **implies that traditional markers are still meaningful** in the author's view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is present through the reference to ""土著"" (natives), which implies a long-term, rooted presence in the area.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is also present through the reference to Dayi accent as a historical marker of local identity, even though it is now being mocked. The author still sees it as a valid marker of local identity.

The author is describing how their family's identity has evolved over generations. The grandfather originally came from Dayi County but the entire family has long since moved to Chengdu. The author notes that there is little communication with relatives in the ancestral hometown and that the family has not returned for visits. By the time of the father's generation, the family already considered themselves ""natives of Chengdu"" (土生土长成都人). This reflects a generational shift in identity rooted in long-term settlement and upbringing in Chengdu.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我爷爷老家是大邑县那边的"" (My grandfather's hometown is in Dayi County) — indicates ancestral origin.  
- ""现在我爷爷的全家亲戚都已经全部搬到成都来了"" (Now my grandfather's entire family has moved to Chengdu) — indicates migration and long-term settlement.  
- ""他们没有过说可能要回到祖籍地去探望一下之类的"" (They never mentioned going back to the ancestral hometown to visit) — implies weakening ancestral ties.  
- ""我爸爸这一代就已经开始说自己就是土生土长成都人了"" (My father's generation already started calling themselves natives of Chengdu) — clearly uses generational settlement and upbringing as the basis for defining ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes that despite the grandfather's origin in Dayi County, the family's long-term settlement and upbringing in Chengdu have led to a generational shift in identity. The father's generation explicitly identifies as ""natives of Chengdu,"" using generational settlement and upbringing as the core standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that generational settlement and upbringing in Chengdu are sufficient for someone to be considered a ""true local."" This is a clear expression of family historical rootedness and individual growth history as the basis for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author explicitly uses generational settlement and upbringing as the standard for defining ""local identity,"" which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).

思想观念，口音，穿着品味,RL4,"  
The author lists three elements—thought patterns (""思想观念""), accent (""口音""), and clothing taste (""穿着品味"")—which are all associated with cultural-linguistic and social recognition markers. These are commonly used in Chinese discourse to distinguish between ""locals"" and ""outsiders,"" especially in urban contexts where regional identity is salient.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""思想观念"" (thought patterns) implies cultural or ideological differences that may distinguish groups.  
- ""口音"" (accent) is a direct reference to linguistic-categorical identity.  
- ""穿着品味"" (clothing taste) suggests social or cultural habits that are often associated with regional or class identity.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the text is brief and does not provide full context, the three elements are **collectively used as criteria to define or distinguish between groups**, likely implying that these cultural and linguistic traits are **used to determine who is considered ""local""**. The author is likely implying that these are markers of local identity or insider status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the use of **cultural-linguistic traits (accent)** as a standard for identifying local people. The other elements (thought patterns and clothing taste) could be part of a broader **cultural recognition system**, but they are not as clearly tied to the symbolic ranking logic of local identity as defined by the RL framework. Therefore, only the most clearly aligned element is selected.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The most directly relevant and clearly aligned RL category is **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author emphasizes ""口音"" (accent) as a distinguishing factor. While the other elements may imply broader cultural distinctions, they are not explicitly tied to the symbolic logic of defining local identity in this short text.

The author is questioning whether ""locals"" from cities like Beijing or Shanghai, who move to Chengdu, would be discriminated against in Chengdu based on their **thought patterns**, **accent**, and **fashion taste**. The rhetorical tone suggests a reflection on the universality of **linguistic-cultural recognition** and **social embeddedness** in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (natives/locals) implies a contrast between ""original locals"" and ""outsiders"" in Chengdu.  
- ""思想意识"" (thought patterns), ""口音"" (accent), and ""穿着品味"" (fashion taste) are all markers of **cultural-linguistic recognition** and **social embeddedness**.  
- The rhetorical question implies that Chengdu locals might judge or exclude people based on these features, just as Chengdu people might be judged elsewhere.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is suggesting that **linguistic-cultural recognition** (e.g., accent, fashion taste) and **social embeddedness** (e.g., thought patterns, cultural habits) are used as criteria to judge whether someone is a ""local"" or not, and whether they are accepted or discriminated against in the local community. This is framed as a **mutual or universal standard** in defining local identity across cities.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **linguistic-cultural recognition** and **social embeddedness** are criteria used to define and judge ""local identity,"" even if they are questioning whether such judgments are fair or reciprocal.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is clearly triggered by the emphasis on **accent** and **fashion taste** as markers of local/non-local status.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is also triggered by the reference to **thought patterns** and **cultural habits**, which are seen as part of a deeper social integration or embeddedness in the local culture.

The author is mocking and rejecting the idea that ""urban people"" are inherently more modern, refined, or superior in terms of values, accent, or taste, compared to others. They explicitly criticize the use of cultural-linguistic features (e.g., accent, clothing, taste) as criteria for defining who is ""local"" or ""real urban people."" The tone is sarcastic and dismissive toward such exclusionary logic.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音"" (accent) is directly mentioned as one of the supposed standards for defining ""local people"" or urban identity.  
- ""思想观念、口音、穿着品味"" (values, accent, clothing taste) are all listed as superficial ""shame cloths"" used to distinguish urban from non-urban people.  
- The author is responding to or challenging a viewpoint that implicitly uses these as criteria to define ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **explicitly rejecting** the use of linguistic-cultural markers (RL4) and possibly other symbolic markers (e.g., values, taste) as valid standards for defining local identity. They do not themselves propose or endorse any alternative standard for defining ""local people"" in this text.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author contrasts the behavior of their real-life ""Chengdu local friends"" with the image of Chengdu people seen online, implying that the Chengdu locals they know do not exhibit the kind of elitism or prejudice they observe online. However, the author still notes that the perceived ""hierarchy of disdain"" (鄙视链) in Chengdu is more severe than in Beijing, and that people from the inner city of Chengdu (比京二环的好像要牛气多了) are seen as more ""prestigious"" or superior.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都本地朋友"" (Chengdu local friends) refers to people the author considers as ""true locals.""  
- ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain) implies social hierarchies or symbolic rankings based on local status.  
- ""比京二环的好像要牛气多了"" (more ""prestigious"" than Beijing's Second Ring Road residents) suggests a comparison based on **administrative or spatial positioning** and **social status**, where people from the core urban area are considered more ""local"" or superior.  
- The phrase implies that **spatial positioning (inner city vs. outer areas)** is a key marker of local identity and status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting the symbolic value of **being from the inner city** (implied by the comparison to Beijing’s Second Ring Road) as a marker of local identity and social status. The phrase ""比京二环的好像要牛气多了"" explicitly links spatial positioning to perceived superiority in local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is endorsing the idea that **spatial positioning within the city**, particularly being from the core or central area, is a key factor in defining local identity and status. This is used to explain the ""hierarchy of disdain"" and who is considered ""truly local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

They also mention having a small social circle, with most of their friends not being locals, and that they don't consider this unusual. The statement does not emphasize or defend any criteria for judging who is a ""true local,"" nor does it use any specific standard to define local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- ""小时候没有成都土著这个概念"" (There was no concept of Chengdu locals when I was a child) implies that the concept of ""local identity"" is not inherently natural or fixed, but rather a socially constructed label.
- ""这十年也不知道是谁定义了这个概念"" (In the past ten years, I don't know who defined this concept) suggests the author is questioning the legitimacy or origin of the criteria used to define ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not explicitly endorsing a specific standard for defining ""local identity,"" but is instead highlighting that such definitions are arbitrary and constructed. This reflects a critical stance toward the symbolic or normative logic used to demarcate ""localness,"" rather than affirming any specific RL category.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse or apply any specific standard to define ""local identity"" in this text. Instead, they are questioning the existence and origin of such a standard, which does not meet the requirement of this task to annotate only criteria the author **explicitly or strongly implies** as defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not endorse or apply any specific criteria for defining ""local identity,"" but rather critiques the concept as arbitrary and constructed, **no RL category is applicable**.

The author reflects on their identity as a ""local"" (土著) from Changshun Street and contrasts it with other groups who have different forms of social embeddedness—such as rural migrants with land rights and benefits, or military-affiliated families with privileges. While the author does not claim a sense of superiority as a ""local,"" they express a nostalgic appreciation for the old neighborhood and its community ties. This implies that **local identity is tied to long-term settlement, familiarity with the community, and social embeddedness**, even if it does not confer material advantages.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (native/local) and ""从长顺街出来的"" (came from Changshun Street) point to **family rootedness** and **long-term settlement**.  
- ""羡慕当年周边的城乡结合部，有分红，有拆迁，有土地"" (envied the surrounding urban-rural areas for land rights, compensation, and benefits) refers to **social embeddedness and material advantages**.  
- ""羡慕从农村来的，过年可以回乡下放火炮，杀猪，天然无污染环境"" (envied rural migrants for their return to the countryside and natural environment) again touches on **social embeddedness and symbolic resources**.  
- ""很多同学都是军区后勤的家属，也羡慕啊，什么都有优待"" (many classmates were military dependents, who had privileges) reflects **occupational typification and symbolic status**.  
- ""还是很怀念以前长顺上街，中街以及长发街附近的老邻居些"" (still miss the old neighbors from Changshun Shangjie, Zhongjie, and Changfa Street) emphasizes **long-term social ties and community embeddedness**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **long-term settlement** and **community familiarity** (RL3) as the basis of their own identity as a ""local,"" even while acknowledging that other groups (e.g., rural migrants with land rights, military families with privileges) have different forms of **social embeddedness** and **material or symbolic advantages** (RL6 and RL7). The author does not claim superiority but implies that **local identity is rooted in settlement history and social embeddedness**, even if it lacks material benefits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses** the idea that being a ""local"" is tied to **long-term settlement and community familiarity** (RL3). They also **acknowledge** (without necessarily endorsing) the symbolic and material advantages of **social embeddedness** (e.g., land rights, privileges) and **occupational status** (military families), which are used by others to define their own local identity or social position.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author identifies as a ""local"" because they were born and raised in the area, and they have long-term ties to the community.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author acknowledges the importance of land rights, compensation, and privileges (e.g., from rural migrants or military families) in defining social embeddedness and local status.  
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The author references military families as a distinct group with symbolic status and privileges, implying that occupational background can be a marker of local identity or social distinction.

我家反正是三环外城乡结合部，周边啥都有反正不进城里玩一般,RL5,"  
The author is describing their place of residence as being in the suburban-urban fringe area outside the Third Ring Road. They mention that the surrounding area has everything and that they generally don’t go into the city center for entertainment. This implies that the area is perceived as a functional and convenient place to live, and the author appears to accept this as a valid or even preferable living arrangement. The tone is casual and self-accepting.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical Reference:** ""三环外城乡结合部"" (suburban-urban fringe area outside the Third Ring Road).  
- **Functional Description:** ""周边啥都有"" (everything is available nearby), ""不进城里玩"" (don’t go into the city for fun), which relates to **living convenience and comfort**.  
- **Implicit Evaluation:** The author seems to be affirming the livability and sufficiency of the area they live in, implying it is a valid or even preferable place to live.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **functional livability** of the area (amenities, convenience, comfort) as a basis for their living choice and implicitly accepts it as a valid or even ideal standard for defining a ""local"" or desirable living environment. The reference to the suburban-urban fringe is not used to exclude or define others as non-local, but rather to affirm the value of the area the author resides in.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **functional livability** (amenities, convenience, comfort of the living environment) as a valid or even preferable standard for defining a desirable local living area. There is no indication of using this as a boundary to exclude others, but rather as a personal endorsement of the quality of their own area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author evaluates the livability and convenience of their area as a valid standard for a ""local"" or desirable place to live.

The author is discussing the existence of local residents who hold discriminatory attitudes, especially among middle-aged and elderly people living in old, deteriorated neighborhoods. They note that these individuals often express disdain or mockery (""弯脚杆"") when discussing areas outside the Third Ring Road. The author is acknowledging a social phenomenon where **regional perception and identity-based superiority** are used to define or judge who is a ""true local"" and which areas are considered part of the ""real city.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住在那种老破小"" (living in old, run-down neighborhoods) suggests a specific spatial category within the city.  
- ""谈到三环外的5句话就有弯脚杆"" (every 5 sentences about outside the Third Ring Road includes mockery) reflects a **socially sedimented regional hierarchy** and symbolic judgment about which areas are considered ""local"" or not.  
- The contrast between ""很友好的土著"" (friendly locals) and ""有歧视的老土著"" (discriminatory locals) implies the existence of **a dominant or habitual regional cognition** that defines who is ""local"" based on spatial proximity and social attitude.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting a **shared or habitual spatial perception** that treats areas outside the Third Ring Road as non-local or inferior, and that this perception is used to exclude or mock outsiders. This reflects a **cultural shorthand** for defining local identity through **spatial boundaries and symbolic attitudes**, rather than objective criteria like hukou or occupation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not endorsing the discriminatory behavior, but they are **acknowledging and describing a socially prevalent logic**—that **spatial boundaries (like the Third Ring Road)** are used by many locals to define who is ""local"" and who is not. This is a **shared regional cognition** that the author observes and implicitly accepts as part of the local identity framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author identifies a **shared or habitual spatial perception** that defines the ""local"" area as within the Third Ring Road, and that this spatial cognition is used to judge and exclude others.

The author is responding to a prior claim, agreeing with the logic but expressing confusion about the perceived ""优越感"" (superiority complex) of ""成都土著"" (Chengdu natives). The author questions the basis of this sense of superiority, especially since they mention ""土著"" (natives), which is a clear reference to long-term settlement and family roots in the area. This implies that the author is engaging with the idea that being a ""native"" or ""local"" is tied to generational roots and possibly social privilege.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (Chengdu natives) clearly refers to people with deep generational ties to the city.  
- The phrase ""没有拆迁户过的轻松"" (natives don't live as comfortably as resettled residents) implies a contrast in living conditions or social status, possibly due to property ownership or economic changes.  
- The confusion over the ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) of natives suggests that the author is questioning the legitimacy of this sense of superiority, which may be based on generational roots or inherited status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is engaging with the idea that ""成都土著"" are defined by their generational roots in the city, and that this is used as a basis for a perceived sense of superiority. The author is not necessarily endorsing this superiority but is acknowledging the logic of family-rootedness as a standard for defining who is a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author acknowledges the idea that ""成都土著"" are defined by their long-term, generational presence in the city, which is a clear endorsement of the logic of family rootedness as a criterion for local identity, even if they question the justification for the associated superiority.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of generational settlement and family roots as a standard for defining who is a ""true local,"" aligning with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

Output: RL3"
成都人不是被骂的人吗？陈冠希。假打。口音难听。全是槽点。,RL4,"  
The author is expressing a negative attitude toward Chengdu people, listing several perceived flaws or stereotypes: being criticized (""被骂的人""), referencing a person (Eddie Peng, 陈冠希) possibly as a symbol of Chengdu stereotypes, using the term ""假打"" (fake fighting, possibly slang for pretentiousness or superficiality), and criticizing their accent (""口音难听"") as unattractive. These are all used to mock or exclude Chengdu people as ""outsiders"" or as not belonging to the ""true local"" group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音难听"" (difficult-to-listen-to accent) clearly relates to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- The author is implicitly using accent as a marker to judge whether someone is part of the ""local"" or ""non-local"" group, even though it is in a negative tone.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the Chengdu accent as a negative trait to distinguish between ""us"" and ""them,"" reinforcing a boundary between ""true locals"" and Chengdu people. This implies that the author sees the accent as a defining marker of non-local status or as a reason for exclusion.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of accent as a standard to define or exclude Chengdu people from the ""local"" group.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The use of accent as a boundary marker aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), where dialect or accent is used to judge local identity or insider status.

Output: RL4"
都是外地人歧视成都口音的嘛,N/A,"  
The author is pointing out a social phenomenon where outsiders (外地人) discriminate against or mock the Chengdu accent (成都口音). This implies that the Chengdu accent is a key marker of local identity, and that outsiders using it as a basis for exclusion or judgment is a form of linguistic-cultural boundary-making.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a clear linguistic-cultural marker.
- The phrase ""外地人歧视..."" (outsiders discriminate...) indicates that outsiders are using the accent as a criterion to judge or exclude locals.
- The author is highlighting that this discrimination is based on linguistic-cultural differences.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that the Chengdu accent is central to local identity and is used by outsiders to define or exclude who is ""local."" While the author is not explicitly defining ""local identity"" themselves, they are highlighting that linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) is being used by others as a standard to judge localness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly endorsing the use of accent as a standard for local identity but is describing how it is used by outsiders. Since the task requires annotation **only** of criteria the author **explicitly or strongly implies they themselves endorse**, and the author is instead describing a **phenomenon they observe in others**, this **does not meet the criteria for annotation**.

5. Final Determination:  
Although the text discusses linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), the author is **not endorsing** it as a standard for defining local identity. Rather, they are reporting on how outsiders behave. Therefore, **no RL category applies** under the task's constraints.

Output:"
我觉得成都口音挺好听的呀。,N/A,"  
The author expresses a positive attitude toward the Chengdu accent, stating it is ""toddle good to listen to"" (挺好听的). This reflects an appreciation for the local dialect as a cultural or linguistic marker.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The mention of the Chengdu accent (""成都口音"") is a linguistic feature.  
- The author's positive evaluation of the accent may imply a connection to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing a personal preference for the Chengdu accent, but **does not explicitly or strongly imply** that this linguistic feature is used to define who is ""local"" or to draw identity boundaries. The statement is more about subjective appreciation than about defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not present the Chengdu accent as a standard for defining local identity or as a boundary marker for insiders/outsiders. It is a cultural observation, not a criterion for judging localness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use the accent as a standard for defining local identity or distinguishing locals from non-locals, this text does **not** meet the criteria for RL4 or any other RL category.

The author reflects on their social environment in the city, noting that they have always had many non-local classmates and colleagues, and that in their workplace, most people are not local. They emphasize that ordinary people (including non-locals) do not feel superior, but that some local residents (specifically ""拆迁户老嬢嬢""—female elderly people from demolition compensation households) do exhibit a sense of superiority, which the author finds annoying. The author also touches on marriage patterns, noting that most people in their social circle marry locals, but there are also cases of marrying out, and the author advises against making absolute claims about local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Non-local classmates/colleagues** are described as common and ordinary, with no sense of inferiority.  
- **""拆迁户老嬢嬢""** (female elderly locals from demolition compensation households) are portrayed as having **a sense of superiority**, suggesting that certain groups of locals claim symbolic status.  
- The **marriage patterns** (local vs. non-local) are mentioned, but not as a defining standard for local identity.  
- The author **rejects rigid definitions** of local identity, implying a critique of exclusivity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **presence of non-locals** and their **equal social status** as ""ordinary people"" suggests a rejection of the idea that non-locals are inherently less ""local.""  
- The **superiority of certain local groups** (拆迁户老嬢嬢) is highlighted as problematic, suggesting that **social embeddedness** (e.g., property ownership, displacement compensation) is used to **symbolically distinguish** ""true locals"" from others.  
- The **author critiques this symbolic hierarchy**, but the **existence of such a hierarchy** itself is an expression of RL6 logic.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The **author does not endorse** the superiority of certain locals, but the **existence of such a claim** (linked to property or social embeddedness) is **described and implicitly criticized**.  
- The **author's own stance** is more inclusive, but the **underlying logic** of social embeddedness (e.g., property, displacement compensation) is **used by some locals to assert symbolic status**, which is **part of the local identity framework**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the **use of social embeddedness and economic status** (e.g., being a 拆迁户, owning property, displacement compensation) to assert symbolic superiority and define a ""true local"" status, which is a key feature of **RL6**. The author **does not endorse** this logic but **describes its existence and critiques it**, which is acceptable under the guidelines as long as it is **used to define local identity** by others.

The author reflects on their childhood experience as a ""local"" in Chengdu, where they perceived material and social advantages (such as not paying rent, returning home for meals and sleep, and being envied by migrant workers). However, the author now feels that the traditional distinction between ""local"" and ""non-local"" is blurring, especially as many migrants have also settled in Chengdu, bought homes, and no longer perceive the author as having a clear ""local"" advantage. The author no longer feels a strong sense of superiority or distinctiveness in their ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不给房租"" (not paying rent) and ""回家吃饭睡觉"" (returning home for meals and sleep) imply economic advantages or living conditions traditionally associated with being a local.  
- ""四川其他地方来打工的"" (migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan) and ""听说你是本地人，他们很羡慕哈"" (they are envious when they hear you're a local) suggest that locals are perceived as having a higher status or better living conditions.  
- ""小孩父母都是过节回老家"" (children’s parents go back to their hometown during holidays) and ""我们咋没有老家"" (why don’t we have a hometown?) contrast the author's ""local"" upbringing with the migrant experience of having a distinct ""hometown.""  
- ""人家也都在成都买了房定居了"" (they have also bought homes and settled in Chengdu) implies that the traditional ""local"" identity is becoming less distinct as migrants integrate.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author initially perceived economic and social advantages (such as not paying rent and being envied by migrants) as markers of being a ""local."" However, as many migrants have also settled in Chengdu and no longer perceive the author as having a clear advantage, the author concludes that the traditional criteria for being a ""local"" are no longer as meaningful. The author implicitly questions the validity of these traditional criteria and acknowledges the erosion of a clear ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the traditional criteria for ""local"" identity (such as economic advantage, not paying rent, or having a ""hometown""). Instead, the author **implicitly critiques** or **resists** these criteria by showing how they no longer hold in a context where migrants have also settled and blurred the lines between ""local"" and ""non-local."" Therefore, **no RL criteria are endorsed by the author** in this text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text discusses potential criteria for local identity (such as economic conditions and settlement history), the author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse these as valid standards for defining who is ""local."" Instead, the author reflects on how these distinctions have become less relevant. Thus, **no RL category is applicable**.

Output:"
没有，倒是会被外地人歧视，说我说话口音牙尖弯酸，天天都说“电炒饭”,RL4,"  
The author is expressing that they experience discrimination from outsiders, who mock their local accent and speech habits—specifically, the use of the term “电炒饭” (electric fried rice), which may be a regional idiom or expression. The author is highlighting how outsiders judge or mock them based on linguistic and cultural speech differences, implying that these differences are used to distinguish locals from outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of **“口音” (accent)** as a distinguishing feature.  
- Use of a **regional expression** (“电炒饭”) that outsiders may not understand or mock.  
- The **negative judgment** from outsiders based on linguistic and cultural speech habits.  
- The **author’s identity** as someone whose speech is being judged, implying a local identity tied to language.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly conveying that **linguistic and cultural speech differences** are used by outsiders to judge and mock locals, which reinforces the idea that **language and cultural speech habits** are boundary markers for local identity. The author is not directly defining who is local, but the **experience of being judged by outsiders for speaking with a local accent and using local expressions** implies that outsiders **use these linguistic features to define who is not local**—and by contrast, the author sees themselves as local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **linguistic and cultural speech habits** (accent and local expressions) are **used as markers of local identity**, especially in the context of **outsiders judging locals**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it reflects how **language and cultural speech** are used to distinguish locals from outsiders and are treated as **criteria for insider/outsider status**, even if indirectly.

The author expresses frustration at being mocked for their accent by others in Chengdu, and asserts a strong sense of self-determination in how they speak. The tone is defensive and defiant, indicating that the author perceives accent as a sensitive and personal issue that is being used to judge or exclude them.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音好难听"" (my accent is hard to listen to) implies a **linguistic-cultural difference** being used to judge the speaker.  
- The author is from Dujiangyan but works in Chengdu, suggesting a **cross-regional identity** context.  
- The phrase ""关你毛线事"" (what business is it of yours) indicates **resistance to external judgment**, especially regarding accent.  
- The author asserts ""我爱咋咋说"" (I speak however I want), emphasizing **personal identity and linguistic autonomy**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is responding to an implicit or explicit **use of dialect/accent as a marker of local identity**, where the speaker with a different accent is perceived as ""non-local"" or ""less local."" The author resists this judgment, but the very act of defending their accent implies that **linguistic-cultural recognition is being used by others to define local identity**, and the author is reacting to that dynamic.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author resists being judged for their accent, the **underlying logic of using accent as a standard for local identity is still present in the discourse**. The author does not reject the logic of linguistic-cultural recognition per se, but rather **rejects the judgment or mockery based on it**. Therefore, **the logic of RL4 is still relevant** because the author is responding to a **linguistic-cultural standard being used to define or exclude ""local people.""**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's frustration and defiance are triggered by **the use of accent as a cultural-linguistic marker to judge local belonging**, which is a core element of **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**. The author does not endorse the judgment but is reacting to a standard that is being applied by others, which still falls within the scope of this RL category.

The author is emphasizing the **cultural and emotional rootedness** of ""natives"" (土著) in Chengdu. The text highlights how a sense of local superiority stems from **multi-generational settlement**, **shared cultural practices (e.g., dialect, traditions)**, **deep emotional ties to the city**, and **long-term social relationships** (e.g., lifelong friends, family gatherings). The author contrasts this with materialism (e.g., property ownership, wealth) and implies that **true ""local"" identity** is defined by **historical and cultural continuity**, **social embeddedness**, and **emotional belonging**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""全家上数下数几代人都在一个地方""** (multiple generations of the family living in the same place) → indicates **family rootedness**.
- **""逢年过节大家庭聚会其乐融融""** (family gatherings during festivals) and **""大家族氛围""** (big family atmosphere) → indicates **social embeddedness**.
- **""说着成都话聊着生活过往""** (speaking the local dialect and sharing life experiences) → indicates **linguistic-cultural recognition**.

- **""一起长大的同学朋友三十年后还是在一起""** (childhood friends still together after 30 years) → indicates **social embeddedness**.
- **""成都都是我们以及我们的祖辈的家""** (Chengdu is our and our ancestors’ home) → indicates **family rootedness** and **vernacular spatial authority**.
- **""买了几个房子值多少钱""** (how many houses one has bought and their value) → **not endorsed** by the author, but mentioned to contrast with the ""local"" value system.
- **""成都人都有房子，不管好坏，住着舒服就好""** (Chengdu people all have houses, regardless of quality, as long as it's comfortable) → reflects a **different value system**, but not used as a **standard for defining ""local identity""**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author constructs a **multi-dimensional standard** for defining ""local identity"", where **family history**, **cultural continuity**, **deep knowledge of the city**, and **long-term social relationships** are central. These elements are used to **differentiate ""natives"" from outsiders** and to **justify a sense of local superiority**. The author **rejects materialistic or economic criteria** (e.g., property value) as irrelevant to true ""local identity"".

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author **explicitly endorses**:
- **Family rootedness** (multi-generational settlement).
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition** (speaking the local dialect, shared cultural practices).
- **Vernacular spatial authority** (deep emotional and historical ties to the city, knowledge of its changes, and memory of its streets).
- **Social embeddedness** (long-term social relationships, lifelong friends, family gatherings).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family history (three generations in Chenghua District)** and **linguistic-cultural traits (verifiable accent)** to define and assert their **""true local"" status**, suggesting that these are **valid criteria for being considered a ""real local.""**

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** both **family historical rootedness** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** as **valid standards for defining local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author uses **both generational settlement and linguistic markers** to define their **""true local"" identity**.

有，比上海更甚，直接对你说你说的话（口音）他们听不懂，是哪个县份上的,RL4,"  
The author is describing a strong linguistic and cultural divide, where locals judge outsiders by their **accent** and **regional origin**. The phrase “他们听不懂，是哪个县份上的” (they can't understand you, and they ask which county you're from) clearly shows that **language and dialect** are used as a **boundary marker** to distinguish between locals and outsiders. This reflects the author's observation that **linguistic-cultural recognition** is a key criterion for defining local identity in the context being discussed.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""口音"" (accent)** is explicitly mentioned as a distinguishing feature.  
- **""哪个县份上的"" (which county you're from)** implies a **regional linguistic-cultural identification**.  
- The **social reaction** (they can’t understand and ask where you're from) implies **a symbolic boundary between locals and outsiders** based on language.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting that **language and dialect** are **clear indicators** of local identity. Those who **speak with a different accent** are immediately **identified as outsiders**, and their **regional origin is questioned**, reinforcing the **linguistic-cultural boundary** as a **defining standard** for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **linguistic-cultural recognition** (i.e., dialect and regional speech) is a **key standard** for determining whether someone is a **local** or **outsider**. This is not just an observation, but a **shared social logic** the author accepts as part of the local identity framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The use of **language and dialect** as a **standard for local identity** aligns directly with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**. The author is describing a situation where **linguistic differences** are **used to define and exclude outsiders**, which is the core function of RL4.

可能外地人不希望自己孩子一口四川话吧 毕竟这口音真的好难听 还联姻都用上了,RL4,"  
The author speculates that outsiders might not want their children to speak with a Sichuan accent, implying that the accent is considered undesirable. The mention of ""联姻都用上了"" (""even used in marriage alliances"") suggests that language and accent are used as a cultural or identity marker, potentially as a way to distinguish locals from outsiders or to maintain cultural boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一口四川话"" (Sichuan accent) is a linguistic-cultural feature.
- The author implies that outsiders might resist their children adopting the local accent, suggesting a cultural or identity boundary.
- ""联姻都用上了"" suggests that language is used as a symbolic or even exclusionary criterion in social relationships.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the Sichuan accent as a symbolic marker to distinguish between locals and outsiders, and implies that outsiders may resist adopting it. This reflects a use of linguistic-cultural recognition to define who belongs to the local group and who does not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that linguistic-cultural traits like accent can be used to identify or exclude non-locals, even in social practices such as marriage.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it reflects the use of linguistic-cultural recognition (accent and language) as a standard for identifying local identity or distinguishing between locals and non-locals.

The author is reflecting on Chengdu's local identity and how it is perceived by both locals and outsiders. They acknowledge a stereotype that Chengdu people ""like to boast"" but clarify that the younger generation is more low-key and open-minded. The author emphasizes that they respect high-earning, well-educated outsiders who settle in Chengdu, especially since their own spouse is an outsider. At the same time, they express a subtle sense of superiority rooted in their own achievements (property ownership, high income, and effort), but frame this superiority as a quiet, mature, and humble form of self-worth.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Property ownership and location**: ""我在南门买了两套房"" (bought two houses in the South Gate) – implies social embeddedness and economic status.  
- **Income and job status**: ""月薪还很高"" (high monthly salary), ""领导和公司核心很多都是外地人"" (leaders and core members are often outsiders) – reflects economic standing and professional status.  
- **Educational background and career**: ""我们也都读过大学"" (we’ve all gone to university), ""互联网圈子"" (working in the internet industry) – implies a certain level of cultural and professional capital.  
- **Residence history and generational roots**: ""我家虽然是拆迁户"" (my family is a demolition resettlement household) – hints at a transition from rural to urban life, possibly with a sense of upward mobility.  
- **Social embeddedness and belonging**: ""成都人"" (Chengdu people), ""安家买房"" (settling down and buying a house in Chengdu) – indicates a long-term commitment to the city and a sense of rootedness.  
- **Attitude toward outsiders**: The author respects and admires outsiders who have achieved success in Chengdu, especially in professional and financial terms.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author constructs a local identity that is **not** based on exclusion but rather on **achievement, effort, and social embeddedness**. While they reject the idea of overt local pride or xenophobia, they subtly define a ""true local"" through **property ownership, economic success, and long-term integration into the city**. This suggests that **social embeddedness (RL6)** is a key criterion for defining local identity. The author also implicitly accepts **outsiders who have become economically and socially embedded in the city** as part of the ""local"" group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **social embeddedness** (RL6) as a key standard for defining who is a ""true"" Chengdu person. This includes **property ownership in core areas**, **high income**, **professional success**, and **long-term residence and effort in the city**. The author also **rejects exclusionary criteria** like birthplace or accent (RL1, RL4), and **does not emphasize generational roots** (RL3) as a primary factor. While they mention being a ""demolition resettlement household,"" it is not framed as a core identity marker, and the focus remains on **current economic and social integration**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **social embeddedness** (RL6) as the primary standard for defining a ""true"" Chengdu person. This includes **property ownership in desirable areas**, **high income**, **long-term professional integration**, and **a mature, low-key attitude toward these achievements**. The author also accepts **outsiders who have embedded themselves in the city** as part of the local community, which reinforces the idea that **social and economic integration** is more important than birthplace or generational roots.

The author is **mocking and critiquing** the behavior of people who **claim to be ""native locals""** (土著) and **define local identity** through rigid spatial boundaries (e.g., ""only the five districts are real Chengdu""), social status (e.g., ""farmer migrants have low quality""), and lifestyle (e.g., ""natives are those who enjoy life and don’t work""). The author **explicitly opposes** these criteria and **does not endorse** them as valid standards for defining ""local identity."" Instead, the author is **exposing the hypocrisy and exclusiveness** of such self-proclaimed ""natives"" who act superior within their city but become submissive when encountering outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""真正的成都人都是不上班的"" – implies leisure/lifestyle as a marker of ""localness"" (possibly RL5 or RL6).  
- ""南门那边都是外地来打工的"" – implies spatial boundary (RL1) and outsider status (RL4).  
- ""天府新区那边一堆农民拆迁的，整体素质不高"" – implies occupational status (RL7) and spatial boundary (RL1).  
- ""华阳，龙泉也能叫成都？只认五城区哈"" – implies administrative or spatial boundary (RL1 or RL2).  
- ""土生土长的本地人都是享受生活的"" – implies lifestyle as a marker (RL5 or RL6).  
- ""除了五城区，都是郊区"" – implies spatial boundary (RL1 or RL2).  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These statements **do not represent the author’s own criteria** for defining local identity. Instead, they are **parodied views** the author is **critiquing and rejecting**. The author **does not endorse** the logic of spatial exclusivity, occupational status, or lifestyle-based identity claims. The author is **pointing out the absurdity and exclusiveness** of such views, **not using them to define local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria mentioned in the text. The text is a **satirical critique**, not an endorsement of local identity definitions. Therefore, **no RL categories apply** to the author’s own position in this text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text contains elements that **could be mapped to RL1, RL2, RL5, RL6, or RL7**, the **author does not endorse** any of them. The author is **critiquing** the logic behind these definitions, not using them. Thus, **no RL labels are applicable** to the author’s own criteria for defining local identity.

Output:"
给你讲个笑话，成都土著有优越感，哈哈哈哈哈哈,RL3,"  
The author makes a humorous remark about ""Chengdu locals"" having a sense of superiority, indicating a self-aware or ironic acknowledgment of how local identity is perceived—specifically, that Chengdu locals may feel superior due to their long-standing local status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (Chengdu locals) refers to people with deep generational roots in the area.  
- The term ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) implies that the author (or the speaker within the joke) is referencing a commonly perceived hierarchy or symbolic value associated with being a ""true local.""  
- The use of ""土著"" (native/indigenous people of the area) is a key indicator of family rootedness and historical settlement.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely making a joke, but is implicitly acknowledging that being a ""Chengdu native"" (i.e., someone with long-term or generational ties to the city) is associated with a symbolic sense of superiority. This reflects the use of family rootedness as a standard for local identity and social hierarchy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author, while joking, implicitly accepts or references the idea that being a ""native"" (土著) is a source of local identity and symbolic superiority, which aligns with the logic of family rootedness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with RL3, as it centers on the symbolic value of generational settlement and the idea that ""true locals"" (natives) are distinguished by their deep historical ties to the city.

The author argues that when judging whether someone is a suitable marriage partner, the key criteria are **economic conditions** and **family background**, especially whether the partner's family can provide retirement support and avoid becoming a financial burden. The author explicitly states that **local identity (e.g., being a ""native"" or ""土著"") is not the main factor**, and that this standard applies universally across Chinese cities. The author emphasizes that **economic and social embeddedness**, not geographical origin, are the real determinants in such judgments.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地土著，父母n套房，退休工资贼高的那种"" — implies **social embeddedness** (RL6) through property ownership and stable retirement income.  
- ""县城里面务农，父母没得退休金的家庭"" — implies **lack of social embeddedness** and economic stability.  
- ""这个跟是不是成都土著没关系"" — explicitly **rejects** geographical or historical origin (RL1, RL3) as a core factor.  
- ""门当户对"" — reinforces the **economic and social status** as the standard for compatibility.  
- ""挑需不需要娃娃负担养老"" — highlights **economic burden and social responsibility**, which ties to **social embeddedness and economic status** (RL6).  
- ""县城有钱的他们还挑不挑？"" — suggests that **wealth and economic power** (RL6) override geographic origin.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **economic and social embeddedness** (e.g., property, retirement income, financial stability) as the **primary standard** for evaluating who is a suitable partner or who is ""local"" in terms of social standing. The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that being a ""native"" or belonging to a certain area (RL1/RL3) is relevant. The focus is on **material and social resources** as markers of local legitimacy and social value.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** economic and social embeddedness (RL6) as the key standard for defining value in a partner or family, and **explicitly rejects** geographical origin or historical rootedness (RL1/RL3) as relevant. There is **no endorsement of linguistic (RL4), administrative (RL2), or occupational (RL7)** criteria in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** because it uses **economic resources, property, and retirement stability** as the criteria for defining social legitimacy and compatibility, which are used to judge whether someone is a ""local"" in terms of social value and integration.

The author critiques urban development that displaces low-income residents, arguing that the removal of this group raises living costs and reduces the city's inclusivity. They contrast newer, ""redeveloped"" areas with old neighborhoods, which are described as more livable and accommodating for low-income residents. The author implicitly defines a ""local"" or desirable urban environment as one that supports and includes low-income populations, emphasizing functional livability and social inclusiveness.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Low-income people are driven out"" implies a loss of social embeddedness and disruption of community stability.  
- ""No service for low-income people"" and ""living costs go up"" point to functional livability and its impact on who can reside in the area.  
- ""Old neighborhoods are convenient, low-income people live comfortably"" emphasizes the livability and inclusiveness of traditional residential areas.  
- The contrast between old and new areas suggests a standard for what constitutes a ""real"" or ""desirable"" local area based on livability and social inclusiveness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence and comfort of low-income residents as a criterion for evaluating the quality of a local area. The author implicitly argues that a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area is one that supports diverse socioeconomic groups and maintains functional livability, especially for those with lower incomes. This reflects a standard for local identity tied to the inclusiveness and livability of a place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses functional livability (RL5) as a standard for defining a desirable local area. The author also implicitly supports the idea that social embeddedness (RL6) is important, as the presence of low-income residents contributes to the stability and character of a local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

有每平方米一万以下的 一二环 老小区00年那种,N/A,"  
The author is describing housing options within the first or second ring road of a city—specifically, older residential communities built around the year 2000, where the price per square meter is below 10,000. This is likely a reference to affordable housing in core urban areas, and the author is either evaluating or seeking such housing. While the focus is on housing price and location, the underlying logic suggests that being able to afford and reside in the first or second ring road is a marker of a stable or ""desirable"" local living condition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一二环"" (first or second ring road): A spatial reference to a core urban area.  
- ""老小区"" (old residential community): Indicates a long-standing neighborhood, potentially with social embeddedness.  
- ""每平方米一万以下"" (under 10,000 RMB per square meter): Economic affordability and housing cost.  
- ""00年那种"" (built around 2000): Implies a generational or historical settlement pattern, potentially linked to family roots.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing a type of housing that is both centrally located and economically accessible. While the text does not explicitly state that this is used to define who is ""local,"" the reference to living in a core area (first or second ring) and the mention of an older neighborhood may imply a value judgment on the quality of local living conditions. This could be interpreted as part of a broader logic that views core urban areas as more ""local"" or desirable.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not explicitly endorse these features as criteria for defining ""local identity."" The text is more about housing options and affordability than about identity or belonging. The mention of the first or second ring road is descriptive rather than evaluative in terms of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does not clearly indicate that the author is using spatial location, historical settlement, or economic status as a standard for defining ""local identity."" The focus is on housing characteristics and price, not on identity or belonging. Therefore, no RL category is applicable.

The author is emphasizing the practicality and desirability of living within the inner and second ring roads of Chengdu, where their parents have long worked and their friends live. They argue that buying a house in the suburbs is unrealistic and that purchasing and renovating a house within the first or second ring road is the best solution. This reflects a preference for core urban areas based on proximity to social networks, convenience, and economic feasibility.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""买一个环境好点还在二环内的房子"" (buying a house in a better environment within the second ring road) reflects a preference for functional livability and environmental quality.  
- ""我爸妈在成都工作这么久，基本都在一二环内"" (my parents have worked in Chengdu for so long, mostly within the first or second ring road) indicates social embeddedness and long-term ties to the area.  
- ""朋友也在附近"" (friends are also nearby) reinforces social embeddedness and the value of proximity to social networks.  
- ""买到郊区肯定不现实"" (buying in the suburbs is definitely unrealistic) implies a distinction between core and peripheral areas, with the former being more desirable and representative of ""local"" life.  
- ""买一二环的房子改造是最好的方案了"" (buying and renovating a house within the first or second ring road is the best solution) shows the author’s endorsement of property ownership and social integration as markers of a desirable local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses property location (first/second ring road), social ties (parents and friends), and the economic feasibility of property ownership to define a desirable local living environment. These factors are used to justify the value of core urban areas and to distinguish them from less desirable peripheral areas. The author implicitly treats these as markers of a more legitimate or stable form of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the importance of property ownership in core urban areas (first/second ring road), long-term social embeddedness (parents and friends in the area), and the symbolic value of such property and social ties in defining a desirable or authentic local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both **RL5 (Functional Livability)** and **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**.  
- **RL5** is triggered by the author's emphasis on living in a convenient, well-located, and environmentally good area (first/second ring road), which is considered a desirable standard for local living.  
- **RL6** is triggered by the author's emphasis on long-term social ties (parents and friends living nearby) and the symbolic value of owning property in a core area, which is used to define a more stable and authentic form of local identity.

The author is describing the residential area ""Yitai Tianjiao"" located near the Second Ring Road. Although they mention the area's high noise levels and high population density, they emphasize that the price is ""very expensive,"" which implies a value judgment on the area's desirability and status. The author appears to be evaluating the area in terms of its livability and its symbolic value as a ""premium"" location.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""紧靠二环边"" (located near the Second Ring Road) implies a geographical boundary and urban core area cognition.  
- ""各种噪音和高密度"" (noise and high density) refers to the physical and environmental conditions of the area.  
- ""价格就是贵贵贵"" (the price is just very expensive) reflects a perception of value and economic status associated with the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly evaluating the desirability of a neighborhood based on its location near the city core (Second Ring Road), its material qualities (noise and density), and its economic value (high price). These factors are used to judge the area's quality and, by extension, the kind of people who live there—those who can afford it and choose to live in such a location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is using the area's location, environmental conditions, and price to evaluate its status and desirability. These are not just descriptions of the area but are tied to an implicit standard of what constitutes a ""premium"" or ""desirable"" local area, which aligns with the criteria for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects an evaluation of a local area in terms of its functional livability (noise, density, price), which the author uses to assess its quality and value in the context of urban living. This aligns with RL5.

The author is expressing a strong preference for low-rise housing (联排别墅 or 独栋别墅) over high-rise apartments or large flat units (大平层), especially emphasizing a sense of security, autonomy, and control. The author also mentions the economic value of such properties in the inner city (三环内), suggesting that owning such property is a symbol of status and control. The author's stance implies that property type and ownership in a desirable area are central to their ideal of a ""local"" or desirable lifestyle.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""联排别墅 or 独栋别墅"" (townhouses or detached villas) are property types that the author strongly favors.
- ""三环内也有六七百个W的"" indicates a focus on property value and location within a core urban area.
- The author emphasizes the symbolic and functional value of owning property that is both desirable and under one’s control, suggesting that such property ownership reflects a higher status and deeper integration into the local area.
- The author also mentions using the property for business or creative work, implying a deeper social and economic embeddedness in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using property type (low-rise villa), location (inner city), and the ability to use the property for personal or business purposes as criteria for evaluating the quality and desirability of a living environment. These factors are tied to a sense of autonomy, control, and local status, which in turn reflect a deeper form of social and economic rootedness in the area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that owning a high-value property (especially in a core area) is a marker of local status and a more desirable form of local identity. This reflects a belief that property ownership and its associated economic and social advantages are key to being considered ""truly local"" or having a stable and elevated local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author initially believed that anyone within the administrative jurisdiction of Harbin, whether in the city or the county, could be considered a ""Harbin person."" However, after encountering a comment on Xiaohongshu that distinguished between ""county people"" (considered rural and not ""true"" Harbin people) and ""old Harbin people"" (only those from Daoli District), the author's understanding of ""local identity"" has been challenged or redefined.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只要是哈尔滨辖区内"" refers to administrative jurisdiction as a standard for identity.
- ""县里的都是农村的，不属于哈尔滨人"" implies a distinction between urban and rural, and excludes rural residents from the ""local"" group.
- ""老哈尔滨人只有道里的"" refers to a specific district (Daoli) as the core of ""true"" local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on how ""local identity"" is defined by others, particularly by the idea that only people from a specific core district (Daoli) are ""true"" locals, while those from counties or rural areas are not. This reflects a shift in the author's understanding of local identity based on **administrative legitimacy** and **vernacular spatial authority**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not explicitly endorse the distinction made by the comment on Xiaohongshu, but the text reveals that this distinction is being **used by others as a standard to define ""local people""**, and the author is **reacting to and acknowledging this perspective**. Therefore, both **RL1** (vernacular spatial authority—core area as Daoli) and **RL2** (administrative legitimacy—jurisdiction as Harbin) are relevant here.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the **use of administrative jurisdiction (RL2)** as a broad standard for defining ""Harbin people,"" and the **use of a specific core district (Daoli) as the authentic local identity (RL1)**, both of which are used by others to define local identity. The author is reporting and reacting to these views.

The author distinguishes between districts and counties within the broader city of Harbin (哈市). They express that people from surrounding counties identify as being part of Harbin, which is acceptable since they are within the administrative jurisdiction. However, the author finds it amusing when people from those counties claim to be “native to the main urban area” (主城区土生土长的), implying that such a claim is unfounded or pretentious.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""区和县还是不一样的"" (Districts and counties are still different): Indicates a clear distinction between administrative or geographical categories.  
- ""属于哈市辖区范围内"" (Within the administrative jurisdiction of Harbin): Refers to administrative legitimacy.  
- ""说自己是主城区土生土长的"" (Claiming to be born and raised in the main urban area): Indicates an emphasis on generational or historical rootedness in a core area.  
- The author implicitly critiques the claim of being a ""native of the main urban area"" by people from surrounding counties, suggesting that such identity is not genuinely earned or recognized.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) to affirm that being part of the administrative jurisdiction of Harbin is acceptable, but **verbal spatial authority** (RL1) is used to draw a line between those who are considered “true locals” (those native to the main urban area) and those from surrounding counties. The author's criticism of the latter's claim implies that **generational and spatial rootedness in the core area** is a key criterion for a legitimate local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **acknowledges administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as a valid basis for claiming local identity (as long as one is within the city's jurisdiction).  
- The author **strongly implies a preference for vernacular spatial authority** (RL1), using the concept of being “born and raised in the main urban area” as a more legitimate or authentic form of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both **RL1** (verbal spatial authority) and **RL2** (administrative legitimacy), as the author uses both criteria to define or critique local identity. The former is used to distinguish between authentic locals and outsiders, while the latter is used to acknowledge a more inclusive but less prestigious form of local belonging.

肯定不算北京人啊，说话口音也不像，文化背景也不同,RL4,"  
The author explicitly states that someone is not a ""Beijing person"" because their **accent is different** and **cultural background is not the same**. This directly ties to the use of **linguistic and cultural markers** as criteria for defining who qualifies as ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""说话口音也不像"" (their accent is not like a local's) → linguistic recognition.  
- ""文化背景也不同"" (different cultural background) → cultural recognition.  
- These are used to **exclude** someone from the ""local"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **accent and cultural background** as **boundary markers** to determine who is or is not a ""Beijing person."" These are **explicitly endorsed as criteria** for judging local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses** the use of **linguistic and cultural markers** as a standard for defining local identity.

The author emphasizes that they identify as a native of **Shuangcheng** (双城), not as a general ""Harbin person"" (哈尔滨人), and defends the legitimacy of local identity based on **administrative boundaries** and **historical roots**. They explicitly reject the idea that being a ""Harbin person"" carries higher status and express pride in their hometown identity. The author also critiques the tendency to use **dialect or accent** to draw identity boundaries, and affirms the value of all contributors to the city, regardless of whether they are ""old"" or ""new"" Harbin residents.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""My family is from Shuangcheng"" and ""I always say I’m a Shuangcheng person"" → **Family historical rootedness** (RL3).  
- ""By administrative division, the 9 districts and 12 counties can all call themselves Harbin people"" → **Administrative legitimacy** (RL2).  
- ""Because of accents, there are debates and distinctions on Douyin"" → **Linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4).  
- ""I’ve never felt that saying I’m a Harbin person elevates my status"" → This implies **rejecting symbolic hierarchies**, but it does not introduce a new RL standard.  
- ""Every city is built by those who live and work in it"" → This is a general statement about collective effort, not a standard for defining local identity.  
- ""I have never felt ashamed of being from Shuangcheng"" → This is a **defensive stance**, but not a defining standard for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- **Administrative legitimacy (RL2)** is used to argue that all 9 districts and 12 counties have equal legitimacy to identify as Harbin people, countering exclusionary definitions.  
- **Family historical rootedness (RL3)** is used to assert the author's own identity and to affirm the legitimacy of being a ""Shuangcheng person.""  
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** is mentioned as a **resisted criterion** (the author critiques its use in identity debates), so it is **not endorsed** and thus **not annotated**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** using **administrative boundaries** and **family historical roots** as valid and legitimate criteria for defining local identity.  
- The author **resists** the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** as a standard for defining who is a ""true"" local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The author explicitly supports using administrative divisions (9 districts and 12 counties) to define who is a Harbin person.

The author is emphasizing that people from surrounding counties (e.g., Bin County, Hulan, Acheng, Shuangcheng) are **not considered ""local"" to the city center** (e.g., Harbin or Heihe). The author highlights that these areas are **clearly distinguished** in terms of identity and geography, and that people do not conflate them with the city itself. The author also notes that **transportation, administrative boundaries, and naming conventions** are used to draw these distinctions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""没有人认为宾县=哈尔滨""** — implies a **strong social consensus** that Bin County is not considered part of Harbin.  
- **""开车要出城，开高速才能到""** — highlights **spatial separation** and **transportation barriers** as markers of non-locality.  
- **""来哈尔滨和回宾县""** — reflects **habitual spatial cognition** in how people conceptualize travel and identity.  
- **""呼兰阿城双城，更不是一个地方了""** — reinforces **distinct regional identities** and **geographical separation**.  
- **""行政上属于黑河下面的市，但是从来不会认为这是黑河的一部分""** — contrasts **administrative boundaries** with **common perception**, indicating that **social cognition** (not administrative status) defines local identity.  
- **""只有市区才算是这个市啊""** — explicitly states that **only the city center is considered ""local""**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **socially accepted regional distinctions** and **habitual spatial cognition** (such as how people talk about travel and identity) to define what counts as ""local"" and what does not. These distinctions are **not based on administrative boundaries**, but rather on **shared cultural and spatial perceptions** that differentiate the city center from surrounding counties. The author is clearly **advocating for and using this socially sedimented spatial logic** to define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly and strongly endorses** the use of **socially accepted regional distinctions** and **habitual spatial cognition** to define what is and is not considered ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it uses **socially sedimented regional distinctions and habitual spatial cognition** to define the boundaries of ""local"" identity.

The author is explaining the historical and administrative evolution of what constitutes the core of ""Harbin"" from a local perspective. They clarify that older Harbin residents traditionally consider only the original seven districts (plus now-defunct ones like DONGLI and TAIPING) and five counties as ""true"" Harbin, while other areas are seen as suburban or not fully part of the city. However, the author ultimately argues that **from an administrative standpoint, all people within the city's boundaries are ""Harbin people,"" and it's unnecessary to make such distinctions**. This reflects a tension between **traditional social habit-based spatial cognition (RL1)** and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical and social perception of ""core"" Harbin (original seven districts and five counties)** reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.
- **Mention of administrative boundaries (""9区12县"", ""行政区域内"")** reflects **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
- **The author’s final stance** that ""all within the administrative region are Harbin people"" suggests a **rejection of the vernacular-based definition in favor of the administrative one**.
- The author does **not reject** the traditional spatial perception but **points out its limitations** and promotes the administrative boundary as the more legitimate or inclusive standard.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **RL1 and RL2**, but their **core argument** is to **endorse the administrative legitimacy** as the more inclusive and legally valid standard for defining who is a ""Harbin person,"" while acknowledging the **historical and social habit-based spatial perception** as part of the background.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the standard for defining local identity.
- The author **acknowledges but does not endorse** the vernacular spatial authority (RL1) as a **residual or outdated** way of defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The text clearly aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author **argues for administrative boundaries as the standard for local identity**.
- The **mention of traditional spatial cognition** is **acknowledged but not endorsed as the author’s own standard** for defining local identity, so **RL1 is not selected**.

The author is responding to a categorization or exclusion, likely in the context of defining who is ""local."" By saying ""都是，又不是不属于哈尔滨"" (""They are [local], they are not outside of Harbin""), the author is emphasizing that a certain group or area should be considered part of the ""local"" identity in Harbin, countering an implicit or explicit exclusion.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase implies that there is a socially or administratively accepted boundary for what counts as ""local"" in Harbin.  
- The author is defending the inclusion of a group or area within the local identity framework.  
- There is a suggestion of a conventional or habitual spatial understanding of ""Harbin"" that may be contested or misunderstood.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is challenging or correcting a spatial boundary definition that may have been used to exclude a group or area from the ""local"" category. This suggests that the author assumes or appeals to a shared or conventional understanding of what constitutes the local area in Harbin.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that certain areas or people should be included in the ""local"" identity of Harbin, and that this inclusion is based on a shared or conventional spatial understanding rather than exclusionary logic.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author is asserting that a certain spatial boundary should be considered part of the local identity based on conventional or habitual understanding, rather than administrative or other criteria.

The author is clearly challenging the idea that certain districts or counties should be excluded from the definition of ""local people"" in Harbin. They question the logic behind such exclusions, especially when some ""old Harbin people"" consistently deny the local identity of residents in certain districts or counties. The author implies that **administrative boundaries** are the legitimate basis for defining who is a ""local,"" and that attempts to exclude certain areas based on social perception are invalid.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""归属于哪个市"" (which city does it belong to?) — this directly references **administrative legitimacy**.
- ""电视上说一个区除外可以"" (it's okay for TV to say one district is excluded) — the author is acknowledging administrative boundaries as a standard.
- ""县也不算哈尔滨的，个别的区也不算哈尔滨的"" — this is a **resisted standard**, as it reflects a **viewpoint the author is challenging**, not one they endorse.
- ""这些你们不承认的地方他到底属于哪啊"" — the author is questioning the legitimacy of excluding areas based on non-administrative criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **explicitly rejecting** the idea that social or habitual definitions (e.g., ""old Harbin people"" excluding certain districts) should override **administrative boundaries**. They argue that **administrative affiliation** is the only valid standard for defining who is a local.

The author is **explicitly rejecting** and **mocking** the idea that local identity in Harbin should be defined by administrative boundaries, dialects, or other symbolic markers of ""purity."" They are defending the idea that people from different parts of the broader Harbin region (including counties) are equally part of the city, especially in the context of shared experiences (e.g., growing up near oil rigs). The author emphasizes that **true local identity is not based on administrative or linguistic markers**, but on shared life experiences and cultural roots. The author also contrasts this with what they see as a narrow, elitist, and self-aggrandizing view of ""localness.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative boundaries** are criticized as being used to draw distinctions between ""genuine"" and ""lesser"" locals.  
- **Dialect and speech habits** are mentioned as identity markers being used to exclude.  
- **Shared life experiences** (e.g., growing up near oil rigs, shared regional culture) are emphasized as a more legitimate basis for local identity.  
- **Municipal policies** and **geographic labels** (e.g., ""county-produced"" red sausage) are used as examples of how symbolic administrative distinctions are being misused.  
- **Social embeddedness** (e.g., ""oilfield children and wetland farmers"") is used to affirm local belonging.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), and RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) as criteria for defining local identity. Instead, they **endorse** a broader, more inclusive definition of local identity based on **shared cultural and life experiences**, **regardless of administrative or linguistic markers**. The author also implies that **social embeddedness** (RL6) and **family history in the region** (RL3) are more legitimate markers of local identity, as seen in the reference to ""oilfield children and wetland farmers.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the use of administrative boundaries, dialects, or symbolic policies to define local identity.

一个哈尔滨还分起来是不是正不正宗的哈尔滨人了市里的房价也没比我周边县城贵多少什么时候贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧,N/A,"  
The author is rejecting the idea of distinguishing ""authentic"" vs. ""inauthentic"" Harbin locals, and is critical of attempts to define ""local identity"" based on geographical or economic hierarchy. The author implies that such distinctions are unnecessary in Harbin because the city's internal economic and housing price differences are not as extreme as in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou. This suggests the author resists using administrative or economic markers to define local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一个哈尔滨还分起来是不是正不正宗的哈尔滨人了"" (Why is Harbin splitting into ""authentic"" and ""inauthentic"" locals?) — implies resistance to identity hierarchies.
- ""市里的房价也没比我周边县城贵多少"" (The housing prices in the city are not much higher than in surrounding counties) — relates to economic status or property as a potential marker.
- ""什么时候贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧"" (Only when the wealth gap becomes as big as in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou should we start dividing people) — implies that economic disparities are not currently significant enough to warrant such distinctions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing any specific criteria to define ""local identity"" but is explicitly rejecting or resisting the idea of using administrative boundaries, economic status, or housing prices to make such distinctions in Harbin. The author's stance is anti-hierarchical and anti-fragmentation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this text. Instead, they are **explicitly resisting** such criteria, particularly those related to economic status or housing price differences (which could relate to RL5 or RL6), and are **not endorsing** administrative or generational markers either. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable** here.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not endorsing any specific criteria for defining local identity, and is instead resisting the idea of such distinctions, **no RL category is applicable** to this text.

Output:"
说嗯呐的不属于哈尔滨市里的,RL4,"  
The author states that people who ""say '嗯呐'"" (a specific linguistic feature or phrase) are not considered part of the ""urban core"" of Harbin. This implies that the use of a particular linguistic expression is being used to distinguish between those who are ""local"" and those who are not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""说嗯呐"" (speaking ""嗯呐"") is a linguistic marker.
- The author uses this linguistic trait to exclude certain people from being considered part of the ""urban core"" or ""true locals.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a linguistic feature (""嗯呐"") as a symbolic boundary to define who belongs to the ""urban core"" of Harbin and who does not. This implies a cultural-linguistic recognition standard for determining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly uses linguistic recognition as a standard to judge who is or is not part of the ""urban core"" of Harbin, which is a clear endorsement of this criterion.

The author explains the historical and spatial development of Harbin, emphasizing that the city center is defined by its historical construction centered around the railway and the museum roundabout. The author contrasts this with the old urban area of Daowai, which is described as a traditional gathering place for ""local Harbin people,"" but not the official or planned city center. The author is making a distinction between two different understandings of the ""center""—one based on historical urban planning and another based on the traditional settlement of ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""The city center is in the museum roundabout because of the Russian construction along the railway line"" → Historical urban planning and spatial authority.
- ""The old city center is where the government offices, museums, and old commercial centers are"" → Historical settlement and symbolic cultural landmarks as markers of the ""true"" center.
- ""Daowai is where the old Harbin people live"" → A historically rooted local population area, not defined by urban planning but by traditional settlement.
- The contrast between ""planned city center"" and ""local people's center"" → A distinction between administrative/cultural urban planning and vernacular spatial identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical urban development patterns and spatial authority** to define what constitutes the ""true"" city center of Harbin. This reflects a **socially and historically sedimented spatial cognition** of the city's core. At the same time, the author acknowledges a **traditional settlement area** (Daowai) as the ""local people's center,"" which is **not defined by urban planning but by long-standing local settlement and identity**. Both perspectives are framed as **legitimate spatial identities**, but they serve **different purposes** in defining ""localness""—one as the **planned urban core**, the other as the **vernacular, traditional settlement center**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses both** the **historical spatial authority** (RL1) and the **vernacular spatial identity** (RL1 again, but from a different angle) as legitimate ways to define the city center and the people who inhabit it. The author also **does not negate** the local people’s traditional settlement area as a valid form of local identity, even though it is not the planned center.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it emphasizes the **historically sedimented spatial cognition** of the city, both in terms of **planned urban development** and **traditional settlement areas**. The author uses **spatial markers** (government buildings, museums, churches, old commercial centers) and **regional identity** (Daowai as the ""local people’s center"") to define what counts as the ""true"" or ""local"" city center.

The author reflects on the changing perception and function of urban centers over time, especially in the context of urban expansion and infrastructure development. They compare the historical and current status of different districts in Harbin (哈西, 群力, 江北) and contrast the past and present advantages of living in the city center. The author also uses their own experience of commuting from the Fifth Ring Road to the Third Ring Road in Beijing to highlight how transportation and infrastructure have changed the relevance of urban core areas. This suggests a shift in how ""local"" or ""central"" areas are evaluated in terms of livability and convenience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical change in urban core areas** (e.g., ""老城区拆迁拆不起"", ""城市发展过快变成城中村"") implies a shift in what is considered a ""core"" or ""local"" area.  
- **Comparison between districts** (e.g., 哈西 vs. 群力) suggests a discussion of which areas are more desirable or ""central.""  
- **Functional livability** is discussed in terms of **transportation convenience** (公交, 地铁, 堵车), **time cost of commuting**, and **accessibility**.  
- The author contrasts **past vs. present** living conditions in urban centers, suggesting a **re-evaluation of what constitutes a ""desirable"" or ""genuine local"" area**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **functional livability** (RL5) as a key standard to evaluate the desirability of urban areas. They argue that **what was once considered the core (哈西)** may no longer be the most convenient or desirable due to changes in infrastructure and urban development. The **comparison of commuting time and accessibility** supports the idea that **current livability (e.g., less traffic, better transit options)** is now more important than historical centrality in defining what is a ""good local area"" or where ""real locals"" should live.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses functional livability** as a key factor in defining what constitutes a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area. They also **implicitly reject the idea that historical centrality alone defines ""localness""** in the context of modern urban life.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **transportation convenience**, **accessibility**, and **living comfort** as criteria to evaluate the quality and desirability of urban areas, which directly aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**.

The author uses **geographical scope (RL1)**, **family historical rootedness (RL3)**, and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as key criteria to define ""true locals."" The author implicitly argues that only those whose families have lived in the urban core for generations, have administrative ties (hukou), and whose growth history is tied to the city's development, can be considered ""real locals."" The changing urban boundaries and the author’s own childhood experiences are used to reinforce this view.

- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author mentions the need to **buy a hukou to become a city resident**, indicating that administrative status was a **key factor** in being considered a ""true local"" in the past.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s definition of ""local identity"" is based on **geographical scope (RL1)**, **generational settlement and growth history (RL3)**, and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)**. These criteria are **explicitly endorsed** and **function as standards** for evaluating who is a ""true local.""

The author reflects on the nature of local identity in Hefei, emphasizing that the city has always been an immigrant city and that the so-called ""pure locals"" are rare. The author, who came to Hefei at a very young age (from kindergarten), is considered by others as ""local"" due to their early arrival and long-term settlement, even though they are not *born* in Hefei. The author is highlighting how early childhood settlement and long-term presence in the city can create a perception of local identity, despite not being born there.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""合肥一直都是移民城市"" (Hefei has always been an immigrant city) — suggests a historical pattern of migration and settlement.  
- ""从幼儿园到高中，班上所谓纯正的合肥人就没几个"" (from kindergarten to high school, there were very few so-called ""pure"" Hefei people in the class) — implies that most people considered ""local"" are actually immigrants who arrived at a young age.  
- ""都是90年代跟着父母来的，都是普通话交流，合肥话都不会讲"" (they all came in the 90s with their parents, spoke Mandarin, didn't speak Hefei dialect) — indicates a lack of linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""幼儿园就来了"" (came here since kindergarten) — reflects individual long-term growth history and early settlement.  
- ""在别人看都是本地的"" (to others, we are considered local) — shows how early arrival and long-term presence are perceived as sufficient for local identity.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using their own and others' long-term settlement history from a very young age as a key criterion for how local identity is constructed and perceived. The author also notes that although many people are not *born* in Hefei, their early arrival and upbringing in the city make them be seen as ""local"" by others. This suggests that **individual growth history and early settlement** are central to how local identity is socially constructed and accepted.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses and explains how **individual long-term growth history and early settlement** are used as criteria for defining who is considered ""local."" This is not based on family roots or linguistic-cultural recognition, but on personal history of settlement and upbringing.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness (家族历史根基/个体成长史)**, because it focuses on **individual long-term growth history** (e.g., ""from kindergarten to high school,"" ""came here since kindergarten"") as a key factor in how local identity is formed and perceived. The author is emphasizing that even if one is not born in the city, being raised there from a very young age can be sufficient to be seen as ""local.""

发展起来的晚，年纪大一点的普遍受文化教育水平不高，很多拆迁户（没有歧视的意思，但确实老年人较多 素质确实有待提高）,RL6,"  
The author is commenting on a newly developed area where older residents, many of whom are displaced residents (拆迁户), have lower educational backgrounds and, in the author's view, relatively lower overall quality or behavior. The author adds a disclaimer that they are not being discriminatory, but still implies a judgment about the demographic composition and perceived ""quality"" of the local population.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author discusses the **age and educational background** of residents, particularly in a newly developed area.  
- The mention of **displaced residents (拆迁户)** points to a group that may have moved to the area due to urban development.  
- The author links **age, education, and behavior (""素质"")** to the perceived **""quality"" of local residents**, suggesting that these factors influence how the author evaluates the area's local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **social embeddedness and economic status** (via the context of being displaced residents) as well as **age and education level** to judge the **""quality"" of the local population**. This implies that the author associates being a ""true local"" with being younger, better educated, and not a displaced resident. These are used to **distinguish between different groups within the local population**, suggesting a hierarchy in who is seen as more representative of the local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** using **social embeddedness** (i.e., whether one is a long-term resident or a displaced person) and **individual-level attributes like education and age** as criteria for evaluating the **authenticity or quality of local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The reference to **displaced residents (拆迁户)** and the author’s implicit judgment of their **""quality"" and integration into the local community** aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**. The author is using **residential history and social status** to assess who is more ""authentically"" local or who fits the author's ideal of a local.

Output: RL6"
还有交通特别乱，机动车从不让行人，电动车逆行，到处乱窜不遵守交通规则,N/A,"  
The author is describing the chaotic traffic conditions in a specific area, criticizing the behavior of motor vehicles, electric bikes, and pedestrians for not following traffic rules. However, this is a **description of traffic conditions** and **personal observation or complaint**, with **no explicit or implicit indication** that these conditions are used as a **standard for defining ""local people"" identity** or for evaluating what constitutes a ""local"" area in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of traffic conditions, including non-compliance with rules.
- These are **objective descriptions of urban functionality**, not identity markers or standards for defining who is local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text **does not use traffic conditions or behavior as a standard for defining ""local people"" identity**. The author is merely expressing dissatisfaction with the environment, not constructing a framework for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is **no endorsement or use of traffic behavior or infrastructure quality as a standard for defining ""local people"" identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text **does not provide any criteria or logic the author uses to define ""local people"" identity**, and **does not imply that these conditions are relevant to local identity**, **no RL category applies**.

Output:"
南二环包河区政务东那边，薛河地铁站附近，比如信达的房子和绿地的房子，大概2万左右,N/A,"  
The author is describing a specific geographic area (e.g., Nan'erhuan, Baohe District, Zhengwu East, Xuehe Metro Station) and is referencing specific housing developments (Xinda and Greenland) along with an approximate price range (around 20,000 RMB per square meter). This is a factual description of real estate and its location, likely for informational or transactional purposes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Specific location and housing developments are mentioned.
- Price is referenced, which could relate to economic status or housing value.
- No explicit or implicit discussion of how these factors are used to define ""local identity"" or who qualifies as a ""local person.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text is primarily a real estate-related statement. While it mentions a price range and specific locations, **it does not indicate that the author is using these to define or evaluate ""local identity.""** There is no discussion of how property ownership, location, or price relates to who is or is not considered a ""local person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not using this information to define or evaluate local identity. The text lacks any evaluative or normative language about who is a ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local area.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The content does not align with any RL category because it does not involve the author's criteria for defining ""local identity."" It is a factual statement about housing and location without any evaluative or symbolic meaning tied to local identity.

The author emphasizes that they identify local or regional identity through **dialect** and, to a lesser extent, **physical appearance and demeanor**. They also mention that with more experience, people can distinguish regional identities more finely, such as identifying individuals from specific neighboring provinces. This implies that the author sees **linguistic and cultural markers** (e.g., accent) as the most direct and accessible criteria for judging regional or local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""口音最容易分辨的"" (accent is the easiest to distinguish)** — highlights linguistic-culture recognition as a primary criterion.  
- **""长相气质"" (appearance and demeanor)** — suggests that physical traits are also used, though not as primary.  
- **""不同地域人外貌特点差异很明显"" (clear differences in appearance between different regions)** — implies the author believes physical appearance correlates with regional identity.  
- **""能细分到周边两三个省份的程度"" (can distinguish down to neighboring two or three provinces)** — indicates the author acknowledges a more refined level of regional identification, which may imply cultural familiarity or embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic markers (accent)** as the **primary standard** for identifying regional or local identity, while **appearance and cultural familiarity** serve as **secondary or supplementary criteria**. The mention of being able to distinguish neighboring provinces suggests that **regional embeddedness or familiarity with cultural nuances** is also part of the author’s implicit logic for judging regional identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** **linguistic-culture recognition (RL4)** as the most direct and accessible standard for identifying local or regional identity. The mention of appearance and regional familiarity suggests **some level of social embeddedness (RL6)** or **cultural typification**, but these are **not central** to the author’s main argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text **primarily aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author clearly states that **accent is the most reliable and accessible marker** for identifying regional identity. While appearance and familiarity with regional distinctions are mentioned, they are **not used as criteria for defining ""local people""** in the way that accent is.

啊？我03年的，我妹12年的，我们一家人平时交流都是合肥土话周围的亲戚基本上也都讲合肥话,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that their family, including themselves and their younger sister, regularly uses the local dialect of Hefei (合肥土话) in daily communication, and that relatives in the surrounding area also speak this dialect. This suggests that speaking the local dialect is an important part of their family and community identity, and likely a marker of belonging to the local group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Use of ""合肥土话"" (Hefei dialect) in daily communication.  
- The author and their family members, as well as surrounding relatives, use the local dialect.  
- The dialect is described as a shared, habitual form of communication, indicating its role in defining group membership and cultural identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author presents the use of the local dialect as a natural and habitual part of their family and community life. This implies that speaking the local dialect is a key component of their sense of local identity, distinguishing them from non-locals who may not share this linguistic feature.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of the local dialect as a standard for defining who belongs to the local group and who does not, thereby aligning with the logic of linguistic-cultural recognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it reflects the author’s implicit endorsement of dialect and linguistic habits as a marker of local identity.

The author is responding to a previous context (not fully provided here) and questions the relevance of ""小黑子"" (a derogatory term often used to refer to paid online commentators or trolls) to the discussion. They also question why housing prices cannot be found online, implying a critique of the need for or relevance of such figures in the context of real estate or local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- No explicit or implicit criteria for defining ""local identity"" are presented.
- The text does not engage in defining ""local people"" or evaluating areas based on identity-relevant factors.
- The content is more about questioning the role of online actors or the availability of information.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not using any criteria to define ""local identity"" or evaluating the local area in terms of identity-relevant standards. The statement is a rhetorical response to a prior argument or comment and does not contribute to the construction of a definition of ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
No RL-related criteria are endorsed or used by the author in this text for defining ""local identity.""

哈哈，新来的都在疯狂踩老城区，因为他们恰好赶上的房价最高的那一波,N/A,"  
The author is commenting on a social phenomenon: newcomers are ""crazily criticizing"" the old city area, and the reason is that they ""happened to catch the wave of the highest housing prices."" The author implies that this criticism is motivated by the newcomers' own housing-related interests or frustrations, rather than a genuine evaluation of the old city’s merits or flaws. This suggests a critique of how economic interests and housing affordability influence people's attitudes toward urban areas and their identity as ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Newcomers"" (新来的) and ""old city"" (老城区) establish a contrast between groups and areas.
- ""Criticizing the old city"" (疯狂踩老城区) is an evaluative behavior that may reflect a perception of local identity.
- ""Happened to catch the wave of the highest housing prices"" (恰好赶上的房价最高的那一波) ties economic conditions and housing costs to the behavior of the newcomers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not directly defining ""local identity"" in a clear-cut way, but is instead observing that newcomers criticize the old city due to their own housing-related dissatisfaction. This could imply that economic conditions and housing access influence how people perceive or relate to a city’s core areas, but it does not clearly establish a standard for who is or is not ""local."" The author is more focused on mocking the newcomers’ motivations rather than defining identity boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The text does not present a clear, endorsed standard for defining ""local identity."" While it touches on housing prices and economic conditions, it does not explicitly or strongly imply that these are used as criteria to judge who is ""local."" Instead, it is a commentary on social behavior and housing economics without a direct link to identity definition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
No RL category is clearly or strongly endorsed by the author in this text for defining ""local identity."" The focus is on housing prices and social behavior, not on identity criteria.

The author is comparing the cost of living in Shanghai and Hefei, emphasizing that daily consumption (e.g., groceries like pork ribs) is not significantly different between the two cities, but dining out can be more expensive in Hefei. The author also highlights that housing prices in Hefei are relatively more affordable compared to the Jiang-Zhe-Jin region. However, **there is no explicit or implicit use of these economic or lifestyle factors as a standard to define ""local people"" or to judge the quality or scope of ""local"" areas in terms of local identity**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of consumption levels (e.g., dining out, pork ribs price).  
- Comparison of housing prices.  
- Description of living areas (e.g., Government District, Swan Lake, Wanda Plaza).  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing **personal experience and economic comparison** between two cities.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** use consumption levels, housing prices, or specific areas as **criteria for defining local identity**. These are simply observations about life in different cities.

The author identifies as a ""土生土长合肥人"" (born and raised in Hefei), and reflects on a change in emotional attachment to the city over time. The author expresses a deep initial love for Hefei but now feels it lacks appeal compared to other cities, especially due to its traffic congestion and chaotic environment. The contrast between past and present feelings is used to convey a sense of disillusionment with the city's livability and quality of urban life.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长合肥人"" (born and raised in Hefei) clearly indicates family historical rootedness (RL3).  
- The author contrasts the city's current state (e.g., ""繁杂的交通环境"", ""过马路和各种电瓶车碰撞"") with other cities, implying a preference for better functional livability (RL5).  
- The author's personal emotional shift and evaluation of the city's environment are used to inform their perception of the city's value as a ""local"" place, which is tied to the standards they now apply to define a ""desirable local"" area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The author's self-identification as a ""土生土长合肥人"" is a strong indicator of family historical rootedness (RL3), which they use as a basis for their emotional connection to the city.  
- The author's current dissatisfaction with Hefei's urban environment and preference for other cities reflect an implicit standard of functional livability (RL5) that now informs their perception of what makes a city ""desirable"" or ""truly local"" in terms of quality of life and urban infrastructure.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author explicitly identifies with the ""土生土长"" criterion and implicitly endorses it as part of their identity as a ""true local.""  
- The author implicitly uses functional livability (e.g., traffic, convenience, urban environment) as a standard to evaluate the desirability of a city, and by extension, to distinguish between ""better"" and ""worse"" local areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is triggered by the author's explicit identification as ""土生土长合肥人,"" which is a direct expression of long-term familial settlement and emotional ties to the city.  
- **RL5 (Functional Livability)** is triggered by the author's use of urban infrastructure and convenience (e.g., traffic, ease of walking, urban environment) as a standard for evaluating the city's livability and comparing it to other cities, which informs their current perception of what constitutes a ""desirable local"" place.

The author identifies as a ""native of Hefei"" and reflects on the transformation of Hefei's identity from ""ancestral home of Bao Zheng"" to ""City of the Great Lake."" They acknowledge the city's expansion in area and improved transportation but express concern that social welfare policies have not kept pace. The author hopes for Hefei to become a truly livable city, implying that functional livability is an important criterion for evaluating whether a place is ""genuinely local"" or suitable for long-term local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""合肥土著人"" (""Hefei native"") establishes the author's identity and perspective.
- ""面积大了不少"" (""much larger in area"") and ""交通也在变的便捷"" (""transportation is becoming more convenient"") refer to functional livability and infrastructure development.
- ""民生政策并没有积极跟上"" (""welfare policies have not kept up"") indicates a critique of the quality of life in the area.
- ""希望真正做到宜居"" (""hope to become truly livable"") reflects the author's standard for what constitutes a desirable and ""genuinely local"" living environment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the concept of functional livability—transportation convenience, area expansion, and quality of public services—as a lens to evaluate the evolving nature of Hefei and whether it meets the standards of a desirable and ""genuinely local"" city for its residents.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that a city must meet certain functional and livability standards to be considered a desirable and ""genuinely local"" place for its residents. They imply that these standards are essential for the formation or maintenance of a meaningful local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's evaluation of Hefei is based on the functional livability of the city—its infrastructure and public services—as a standard for determining its suitability as a ""genuinely local"" and desirable place to live. This aligns with **RL5**.

The author is discussing the current situation in Hefei, particularly the challenges caused by rapid population growth and urban management issues (e.g., parking problems). More importantly, the author contrasts **local residents** with **new Hefei residents** (mainly from outside), emphasizing that **local residents are not benefiting from rising housing prices** as much as newcomers, especially those who can afford property in a growing city. This suggests a concern about **local identity and its economic or social value** in the context of urban development and housing markets.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地人也不少的"" (there are not a few locals): confirms the existence of a local population.  
- ""本地人很少吃到房价上涨带来的资产增加"" (locals rarely benefit from the asset appreciation due to rising housing prices): implies that **local residents are economically disadvantaged** compared to newcomers who can buy property.  
- ""跟外地人组成的新合肥人相比，竞争力相对不足"" (compared to the new Hefei residents composed of outsiders, locals are relatively less competitive): this suggests that **newcomers**, especially those who can afford property, are gaining **symbolic and economic advantages** over locals.  
- The contrast between **""local residents"" and ""new Hefei people""** (外地人组成的新合肥人) is central to the author's argument.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **economic embeddedness and property ownership** (or lack thereof) as a standard to evaluate the **hierarchy of local identity**. The author implies that **newcomers** (outsiders) are now forming a new class of ""Hefei people"" who are **more competitive and benefit from the city's growth**, especially through housing market gains. This suggests that **property ownership and economic capacity** are becoming key criteria for **symbolic belonging and local status**, which is used to define who is ""genuinely local"" in the evolving city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is implicitly endorsing the idea that **property ownership and economic power** (especially in a rising housing market) are becoming **standards for local identity and social status**, even if it disadvantages long-standing local residents. The author does not reject this logic but critiques the **imbalance** it creates, which still **validates the logic** of using **economic embeddedness** to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's argument is centered around **property ownership, economic embeddedness, and the changing hierarchy of local identity**, which aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**. The discussion about **local people vs. new residents** and **who benefits from the housing market** reflects how **economic and property-based embeddedness** are used as **criteria to define and evaluate local identity** in a rapidly urbanizing context.

The author is commenting on the authenticity of a local dialect (""阜阳口音"" — Fuyang accent) in Hefei, implying that this accent is representative of the ""true"" or ""authentic"" local identity. The tone is casual but carries an implicit appreciation for the dialect as a marker of genuine local culture.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to a **local dialect** (""阜阳口音"").
- The phrase ""**正宗**"" (authentic/traditional) suggests that speaking this dialect is associated with **genuine local identity**.
- The author is **implicitly endorsing** the dialect as a key feature of being ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the dialect as a **cultural and linguistic marker** to distinguish between ""true locals"" and others. The emphasis on ""authenticity"" of the accent suggests that the author associates dialect with **legitimacy of local identity**, which plays a role in **cultural recognition and insider status**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the **dialect as a standard for local identity**, aligning with the idea that **speaking a specific local dialect is a key feature of being a ""true local.""**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author mentions their hometown is ""大圩"" (Dawei), and then discusses the housing prices and property names (e.g., ""葡萄家园"") in Dawei. The discussion is primarily about housing and property, not about how to define who is or is not a ""local person"" based on Dawei. The author is not explicitly or implicitly using Dawei's housing prices or property names as a standard to judge local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我老家也是大圩的"" (My hometown is also Dawei) refers to personal background and hometown, potentially relevant to local identity.  
- ""大圩拆迁房的房价并不高"" (The price of Dawei's demolition housing isn't high) and ""是什么葡萄家园吧"" (It must be something like ""Wutao Garden"") refer to housing conditions and property names, but these are not tied to defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not using Dawei's housing prices, property names, or any other characteristics as a standard to judge who is a ""local person."" The statement is about personal background and housing in the area, but not about how to define local identity or evaluate who qualifies as local.

The author is criticizing the value of small housing units (60㎡) in a specific context, likely a relocation or resettlement scenario. The author argues that these units are not valuable due to high housing prices, lack of demand, and minimal rental or resettlement compensation. The tone is dismissive and skeptical, emphasizing the limited financial benefit of such housing and the impracticality of expecting significant profit or benefit from it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author discusses property ownership, housing size, and financial compensation, which are relevant to RL6 (Social Embeddedness / Economic Symbolism).  
- The focus is on the **value and ownership of housing**, and how these relate to **economic status and social benefit** in a local context.  
- However, the author is **not using housing or economic status as a standard to define who is ""local"" or to evaluate local identity**. Instead, the discussion is about **housing policy, financial return, and personal gain**, which are **not tied to the author's definition of local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing **disbelief in the financial or social value** of small resettlement housing units and the minimal compensation received. This is a **personal economic evaluation**, not a **definition of who is or is not a local person** or a **standard for judging local identity**.

说实话，我们这一代当时强制普及普通话，天天做这个黑板报，我们能听懂合肥话，但是说出来总是怪怪的，我妈还问我是哪里的口音,RL4,"  
The author reflects on how the younger generation, due to the enforced promotion of Mandarin, is no longer able to speak the local dialect (Hefei dialect) fluently. Although they can understand it, their speech sounds ""awkward"" or unnatural, and even their mother questions the accent they use. This reflects a loss of linguistic-cultural fluency and a resulting detachment from the local linguistic identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The enforced promotion of Mandarin and reduced use of the local dialect.
- The author's ability to understand but not fluently speak the local dialect.
- The awkwardness of speaking the local dialect.
- The mother questioning the author's accent, implying a discrepancy between the speaker and the local linguistic norms.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's inability to speak the local dialect fluently, despite understanding it, signals a weakening of linguistic-cultural recognition. The awkwardness and the mother's confusion further emphasize the speaker's perceived distance from the local linguistic identity, which is a key marker of ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly conveys that linguistic fluency in the local dialect is a standard for being recognized as a ""local."" The fact that they no longer speak it naturally and are questioned about their accent suggests that linguistic-cultural recognition is still a meaningful, if not dominant, criterion for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, as it centers on the author’s relationship with the local dialect and the implications of linguistic fluency (or lack thereof) for local identity recognition.

合肥四个行政区啊，为什么合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区,RL1,"  
The author is questioning why people from Hefei often refer to the Hefei High-Tech Development Zone (高新区) as an ""administrative district"" (行政区), when it is not an official administrative division. This suggests the author is highlighting a **mismatch between popular perception and official administrative boundaries**, implying that people treat certain functionally important areas as if they were administrative districts, which reflects a **socially conventional understanding of local space**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to ""four administrative districts"" of Hefei (administrative legitimacy).
- Mention of the High-Tech Development Zone (高新区), which is a functional zone, not an administrative one.
- The author is pointing out that people **perceive** the High-Tech Development Zone as an administrative district, which suggests **a shared, habitual spatial perception** rather than an official boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is critiquing or observing how people **habitually treat** certain functionally important areas (like高新区) as if they were administrative districts. This reflects a **socially sedimented understanding of spatial identity**, where people's **emotional or habitual mapping of the city** (高新区 = ""local core"") overrides the official administrative classification. The author is indirectly highlighting how **popular spatial cognition** (not administrative legitimacy) defines what is considered ""local"" in people's minds.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author is questioning this perception, the **underlying logic** they are engaging with is the **popular spatial understanding** of高新区 as a meaningful, local core area. This implies that the author **acknowledges or critiques the socially conventional spatial perception**, which is central to RL1.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects a **socially conventional spatial perception** of高新区 as an administrative district, even though it is not one officially. The author is engaging with the **habitual understanding of local space**, which is a key feature of RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Output: RL1"
因为高新区有自己的学区啊，而且管委会管理行政事务，居民办事也不去蜀山区啊，房产证也是高新区，就一个身份证是蜀山区,RL2,"  
The author is explaining why they or others might consider themselves part of the ""High-Tech Zone"" rather than ""Shushan District,"" based on the fact that the High-Tech Zone has its own administrative management (e.g., school districts, government services), property registration, and even though the ID card is registered under Shushan District, the actual daily administrative and living context is tied to the High-Tech Zone. This implies a preference for defining local identity based on **actual administrative function and governance** rather than formal registration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""High-Tech Zone has its own school district"" and ""管委会管理行政事务"" (the management committee handles administrative affairs) indicate administrative autonomy.  
- ""Residents don't go to Shushan District to handle affairs"" suggests a functional separation and a sense of distinct administrative identity.  
- ""房产证也是高新区"" (property title is under the High-Tech Zone) shows that property registration is a key part of defining one’s local connection.  
- ""身份证是蜀山区"" (ID card is under Shushan District) highlights a contrast between formal registration and actual administrative identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **administrative legitimacy** as a standard to define local identity—specifically, the actual administrative functions and services (e.g., education, government services, property titles) that one interacts with daily. This contrasts with the formal administrative division on one’s ID card, which the author appears to downplay in favor of **real-world administrative affiliation**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses using **administrative affiliation and functional governance** (e.g., school districts, government services, property registration) as the basis for defining who is a ""local"" or which area one belongs to. This is a core part of the author’s argument for how local identity is determined in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it defines local identity through the actual administrative and functional governance structure one is embedded in, rather than formal or historical administrative boundaries.

The author is describing their personal experience living in Yaohai District and comparing it with other districts such as Bahe and Shushan. They emphasize that Yaohai and Luyang are very livable (宜居), and while they acknowledge that Bahe and Shushan are more developed, they do not suggest that Yaohai is undesirable. The focus is on the **quality of life and functional livability** in different districts, and the author appears to use these characteristics to evaluate the **value or desirability of local areas**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""瑶海庐阳都很宜居"" (Yaohai and Luyang are both very livable) implies **positive evaluation of functional livability** in these areas.  
- ""买东西真的很方便"" (shopping is really convenient) points to **amenities and convenience**, a key aspect of functional livability.  
- ""发展比较好的区确实包河和蜀山更强些"" (the more developed districts are indeed Bahe and Shushan) suggests a **ranking or hierarchy** of districts based on **development and livability**, which the author uses to assess the **value or quality of local areas**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **convenience of daily life (shopping)** and **level of development** as **standards to evaluate the quality of different local areas**, which implies a **ranking of districts based on livability and development**. This reflects a **functional livability-based logic** for judging what constitutes a desirable or ""true"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **livability and development level** as **standards to evaluate and compare local areas**, which aligns with the **author’s own criteria for judging local area quality**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the **RL5** category, which is based on **functional livability and environmental quality cognition**, i.e., using **convenience of amenities and development level** to evaluate the **quality and value of local areas**.

The author is describing their personal experience living in the Xinzhan area of a city, focusing on the convenience of transportation (subway lines), the industrial nature of the area, and the current economic and commercial support from large factories (e.g., BOE, Visionox, Corning). While the author acknowledges some functional advantages (e.g., subway access), they also note the general average environmental quality and limited commercial vitality. The author does not explicitly define ""local people"" or the criteria for being considered local, but the text reflects an evaluation of the area's functional livability and its role in supporting a certain type of lifestyle or population.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""生活挺方便的"" (life is quite convenient)  
- ""有地铁1号线 三号线 四号线"" (has Metro Line 1, 3, and 4)  
- ""整体的环境一般"" (the overall environment is average)  
- ""磨店那个商业街我也去了 都是一些小吃 奶茶店 平时没什么人"" (the Mogang commercial street has only snack shops and milk tea shops, and it's usually not crowded)  
- ""新站因为很多地区都被定位工业区"" (Xinzhan is largely an industrial area)  
- ""新站那边现在主要靠 京东方 维信诺 和康宁这几个大厂来支撑"" (Xinzhan is mainly supported by a few large factories)  
- ""至于后期的五星级酒店和普通人也没太大关系"" (as for the future five-star hotels, they are not really related to ordinary people)

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating the functional livability of Xinzhan, focusing on transportation, commercial infrastructure, environmental quality, and economic support. These elements are used to describe the area’s current and potential living conditions. However, **there is no explicit or implicit claim that these factors are used to define who is or is not a ""local person"" or to evaluate the local identity of people or areas.** The author is more focused on describing the area’s current state and its suitability for living, rather than using it as a standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author discusses factors that could fall under **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, such as subway access and commercial convenience, these are **not used as criteria to define ""local identity""**. The author is simply describing the area’s livability and economic structure, not using it to draw identity boundaries or make claims about who qualifies as a ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author does **not** use functional livability as a standard for defining local identity. The discussion remains descriptive and does not imply a judgment about local identity based on these factors.

The author, identifying as a ""native of Hefei,"" is explaining the distinction between economic and administrative boundaries in Hefei, particularly regarding the ""Zhengwu District"" (政务区). The author emphasizes that although Zhengwu District is an economically distinct area, administratively it still belongs to Shushan District. The author further uses the analogy of Shenzhen to highlight how economic identity should not override administrative identity when defining local belonging. The author also notes that most locals refer to Tianwa Lake as being in Shushan District, reinforcing the administrative boundary as the key to local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Zhengwu District is an economically distinct area, but administratively belongs to Shushan District"" highlights the distinction between economic and administrative divisions.  
- ""Most locals refer to Tianwa Lake as being in Shushan District"" reflects shared regional cognition and administrative identity.  
- The analogy to Shenzhen emphasizes the importance of administrative legitimacy over economic symbolism in defining ""local"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explicitly using administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining local identity. Economic distinctions are acknowledged but rejected as the basis for identity, with the author advocating for administrative boundaries as the true marker of local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses administrative legitimacy (i.e., official administrative boundaries) as the key criterion for defining local identity, rejecting economic or functional distinctions as sufficient.

The author is explaining the administrative and functional relationship between ""Zhengwu District"" (政务区) and ""Shushan District"" (蜀山区), clarifying that Zhengwu District is a functional area under the jurisdiction of Shushan District. The author is distinguishing between administrative divisions and functional divisions, but not using this as a basis for defining local identity or excluding groups.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of ""functional area"" (功能区) and ""administrative district"" (行政区) suggests a discussion of administrative legitimacy.  
- The author explicitly states that Zhengwu District is administratively part of Shushan District.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is providing an objective explanation of administrative boundaries and functional zones, not using these as criteria to define who is or is not a ""local person."" The tone is informative and neutral, with no evaluative or identity-based implications.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text mentions administrative boundaries, it does not reflect the author using them as a standard for defining local identity. The author is merely clarifying a bureaucratic structure, not asserting a standard for local identity.

The author is expressing a contrast between the widely held perception that **Binhu (滨湖)** is an ideal living area (""滨湖宜居，吃喝玩乐都方便"") and their own personal experience of the area being **sparsely populated and lacking good commercial facilities**. The author is questioning the basis of the perception of Binhu as an ideal living area, suggesting that **not all parts of Binhu meet the criteria for ""good livability""**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""滨湖宜居，吃喝玩乐都方便""** refers to the **functional livability** of an area (amenities, convenience, comfort), which is a core component of RL5.  
- **""地方大是大，但是人好少，也没什么好的商业圈""** reflects the **author's personal evaluation of the area**, and implies that **livability is not uniformly present across the entire region**.  
- The author is questioning the **validity of the standard used to define a ""desirable local area""**, and thus indirectly engages with the **functional livability** criteria in the context of defining what makes a place ""local"" or desirable.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **challenging the generalization** that Binhu is an ideal living area by pointing out that **not all parts of it meet the functional livability standards** (e.g., lack of population density, commercial facilities). This suggests that **functional livability is a standard the author implicitly uses to evaluate what constitutes a ""good local area""**, and that this standard is not universally met in Binhu.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

However, the author does not explicitly use this as a standard to define ""local identity,"" nor do they directly connect civil servant status with local belonging or exclusion.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""公务员分数线最高"" (civil service exam scores are the highest) refers to an occupational group (civil servants) and their presence in the area.  
- The phrase ""高的离谱"" (extremely high) may imply a symbolic association with the area's prestige or hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author mentions civil servants in the context of Baohe District, they do not use this occupational identity to define or evaluate who is ""local"" or to distinguish between locals and non-locals. The statement is more about describing a phenomenon or expressing surprise at the scores, not about using civil servant status as a standard for local identity.

The **housing competition** and **overpass issues** are **descriptive or evaluative of the area's condition**, but **not used as a standard for defining local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The **transportation convenience** is a **clear indicator of functional livability (RL5)**, and the author **uses it as a basis to evaluate the area's livability**, which can be interpreted as **part of their standard for what makes a desirable ""local"" area**.

Output: RL5"
肥东必须是最差，工业园不说了，空气环境不行，交通也不行，设施也跟不上 ， 下雨就涝，地震中心,N/A,"  
The author is expressing strong negative views about the area of Fudong, criticizing its environmental quality, infrastructure, transportation, and even referencing flooding and seismic risks. While this is a clear evaluation of the area's livability, the author **does not explicitly or implicitly link these critiques to a standard for defining who is or is not ""local""**. The text is more about the **quality of the area itself**, not about how to judge the identity of people based on where they live or what characteristics they have.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Environmental quality: ""air environment isn't good"", ""floods when it rains""
- Functional livability: ""traffic isn't good"", ""facilities don't keep up""
- Geographical or natural risk: ""earthquake center""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **evaluating the physical and functional characteristics of Fudong**, but **does not present these as criteria for defining local identity**. There is **no indication that the author is using these factors to judge whether someone is a ""local"" or not**, or to distinguish between different groups of ""local people"".

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL categories are triggered because the author is **not using these features to define or evaluate local identity**. The text is **about area quality, not identity definition**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The content does **not align with any RL category**, as it lacks the **functional link to defining ""local identity""** required by the annotation task.

The author is expressing positive views about the瑶海 (Yaohai) area, emphasizing its **livability** through features such as a vibrant, everyday atmosphere (""烟火气""), complete facilities (""设施配套齐全""), low cost of living (""生活消费低""), and convenient transportation (""交通方便""). These features are clearly being used to highlight the area's appeal and quality as a place to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""烟火气"" (vibrant, everyday atmosphere) suggests a sense of community and livability.  
- ""设施配套齐全"" (complete facilities) indicates functional livability (amenities).  
- ""生活消费低"" (low cost of living) reflects economic accessibility.  
- ""交通方便"" (convenient transportation) is a key aspect of functional livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using these features—**functional livability and environmental quality**—to describe why瑶海 is an attractive and desirable area to live in. These are not just personal preferences but are framed as **standards for evaluating the quality of a ""local"" area** and its suitability for living, which aligns with the logic of defining what constitutes a ""good"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses these **functional and environmental attributes** as indicators of a high-quality local area, which can be used to judge or define the value of a ""local"" space in terms of livability.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **functional livability and environmental quality** as standards for evaluating local areas, which aligns with **RL5**.

瑶海区还行吧，尤其是一环二环那里，我家门口有三号线地铁和能直通市中心的公交车，区内有38中这样的好初中,RL5,"  
The author is describing the瑶海区 (Yaohai District), particularly the area within the first and second ring roads, in a positive light. They highlight the convenience of public transportation (subway Line 3 and direct buses to the city center) and the presence of a well-regarded middle school (38 Middle School). This suggests the author evaluates the area as a desirable and convenient place to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical scope:** ""一环二环"" (First and Second Ring Road), indicating a core urban area.  
- **Functional livability features:**  
  - ""三号线地铁"" (Subway Line 3)  
  - ""能直通市中心的公交车"" (Direct bus to the city center)  
  - ""38中这样的好初中"" (A good middle school like No.38 Middle School)  
These all relate to infrastructure, transportation, and educational resources.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using these features to **justify why the area is a desirable place to live**, implying that these functional and environmental qualities make it a ""good"" or ""real"" local area. The emphasis on accessibility and quality of public services reflects a standard for evaluating the ""local value"" of the area in terms of livability.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the convenience and quality of living conditions (transportation, education) as a basis for considering the area as a desirable and legitimate part of the local urban space.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the RL5 standard, which is based on **functional livability and environmental quality cognition**—using the availability and quality of infrastructure and services to evaluate the desirability and legitimacy of a local area.

Output: RL5"
交通确实很方便的,N/A,"  
The author simply states, ""Transportation is indeed very convenient,"" which is a neutral or positive comment about the transportation system of a place. However, there is **no explicit or implicit indication** that this convenience is being used as a **standard to define ""local people"" identity** or to evaluate the local area in terms of its local identity significance.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通确实很方便"" (Transportation is indeed very convenient) refers to a functional aspect of the living environment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement is a **factual description** of transportation convenience. It does **not imply** that the author is using this as a **criterion to define who is a ""local""** or what constitutes a ""local area"" in terms of identity. The text lacks any evaluative or definitional context related to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does **not use transportation convenience as a standard for defining ""local people"" identity**, no RL category is triggered.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does not provide any evidence that the author is using this feature to define or evaluate local identity. It is a **neutral observation** about infrastructure and not tied to symbolic or evaluative identity construction.

Output:"

The author comments on the convenience of a certain area but also notes the high housing prices and lack of alternatives for improvement. This reflects a personal evaluation of the area’s functional qualities and economic constraints, but **does not explicitly or strongly imply** that these are used as criteria to define who is ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""真的很方便"" (very convenient) relates to functional livability.  
- ""房价贵了"" (high housing prices) and ""改善也没有选择"" (no alternative for improvement) refer to economic constraints and personal living conditions.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing the pros and cons of a place in terms of convenience and cost, but **does not use these to define or evaluate who is ""local"" or to establish a standard for local identity**. The focus is on **personal living conditions and economic hardship**, not on identity boundaries or criteria for local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The text does not present any **explicit or implicit standard** for defining ""local people"" or judging local areas in the context of local identity. The discussion is centered on **livability and affordability**, not on symbolic or evaluative criteria for identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not using the described features to define or evaluate ""local identity"", **no RL category is applicable**.

Output:"
我也喜欢七里塘，摆摊吃 真的很方便，去步行街也很方便，离省医院也不远，也不用下班开车去挤那边,RL5,"  
The author expresses a positive attitude toward the Qilitang area, emphasizing its convenience for daily life, including street food, proximity to the pedestrian street and the provincial hospital, and the ease of access without needing to drive after work. This reflects the author’s appreciation for the functional convenience and accessibility of the area, which contributes to their perception of it as a desirable or ""local"" living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""摆摊吃 真的很方便"" (eating at street vendors is really convenient) – relates to daily life convenience.  
- ""去步行街也很方便"" (convenient to go to the pedestrian street) – reflects accessibility to urban amenities.  
- ""离省医院也不远"" (not far from the provincial hospital) – indicates access to essential services.  
- ""也不用下班开车去挤那边"" (no need to drive after work and get stuck in traffic there) – highlights the functional livability and comfort of the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing the **functional livability** of Qilitang—its convenience in terms of food, shopping, healthcare, and commuting. These are used to support the author’s positive evaluation of the area as a comfortable and practical place to live, implying that such features define a ""good"" or ""genuine"" local living environment.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **functional livability**—such as convenience in daily life, accessibility to services, and ease of commuting—should be part of the criteria for judging what constitutes a desirable or ""genuine"" local living area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author explicitly uses the convenience and comfort of the area’s infrastructure and services to define its value as a local living space.

Output: RL5"
有一系列的配套，离老城区也很近，就很方便,N/A,"  
The author is expressing that the area in question is convenient because it has good amenities (""有一系列的配套"") and is close to the old city (""离老城区也很近""). This convenience is presented as a positive feature of the area and seems to be a reason for its desirability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有一系列的配套"" refers to the availability of functional amenities, which is a key aspect of livability.  
- ""离老城区也很近"" implies proximity to a historically or culturally central area, potentially relevant to spatial perception or convenience.  
- The phrase ""就很方便"" directly evaluates the area as convenient, linking the physical characteristics to a quality of life assessment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the availability of amenities and proximity to the old city to define the area as convenient and livable. While this is a positive evaluation, it does not explicitly or strongly imply that these factors are used to **define who is local** or to **evaluate the localness of an area** in terms of identity or belonging. The focus is on personal convenience and living quality, not on identity criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is describing a desirable living environment but does not use these features to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or the boundaries of a ""local area"" in the context of who is considered local. The discussion is about **personal preference or functional quality**, not **identity criteria**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not explicitly or strongly imply that these factors are used to define ""local identity,"" and the text does not serve as a standard for evaluating who is or is not local, **no RL category is applicable**.

The author is attempting to define the current **geographical scope of Jinan urban area** by specifying the boundaries along the four cardinal directions. This is based on the author's perception of the city's development and infrastructure, and they emphasize that this is not a subjective or biased opinion, but a rational assessment of the city's current spatial structure.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author is proposing **specific spatial boundaries** (e.g., ""二环西高架"", ""二环南高架"") to define the urban area of Jinan.  
- These boundaries are **based on the author's perception of where the city's development has reached**, rather than administrative divisions.  
- The author explicitly states this is not about discrimination or identity exclusion, but a **rational discussion of spatial scope**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **habitual, socially accepted spatial cognition**—that is, shared understandings of where the city ""truly"" lies based on development and infrastructure—to define the urban area. The mention of roads and infrastructure implies a **collective perception of what constitutes the ""real"" city**, rather than an administrative or legal definition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of **shared spatial perception** (based on infrastructure and development) to define the city’s boundaries. This is not about identity exclusion or social status, but rather a **collective understanding of what constitutes the urban core**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author is using **shared, habitual spatial cognition** (e.g., where development has reached, which roads define the boundary) to define the city's urban area. The author is not using this to define ""local identity"" in terms of people, but rather to **define the scope of the city itself**, which is a key aspect of how local identity is often spatially constructed.

The author reflects on how their perception of the city's spatial boundaries and what constitutes ""Jinan"" has changed over time. As a child, they considered the central urban area as ""Jinan"" and places like Jigang as outside it, requiring a train ride to reach the ""real"" city. Over time, as infrastructure (buses, subways) expanded, the author's sense of what constitutes the city has shifted, but still maintains a distinction between the core (CBD, former E'ergang) and the periphery, where electric scooters remain the most practical mode of transport.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从济钢到市区叫做‘去济南’"" implies a historical distinction between ""Jigang"" and the ""city center,"" treating the latter as the authentic or core ""Jinan.""  
- ""坐火车去‘济南’"" reflects a spatial hierarchy where train travel is needed to reach the ""true"" city.  
- ""现在公交、地铁一应俱全"" indicates a shift in infrastructure that has blurred the boundary between ""inside"" and ""outside"" the city.  
- ""不超过CBD（原二钢）还是电瓶车最方便"" suggests that even with modern transport, the core area (CBD) is still the symbolic center of the city, and the periphery is perceived differently.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on how their own spatial cognition of the city has been shaped by historical and infrastructural changes. The contrast between ""Jigang"" and the ""city center"" reflects a long-standing cultural and spatial understanding of what constitutes the core of the city, which is a form of **vernacular spatial authority**. The author implicitly accepts this historical boundary as a standard for defining the city's ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that the city's core (CBD, former E'ergang) is the true ""Jinan,"" and that places like Jigang were historically perceived as peripheral. This reflects an implicit acceptance of a **socially sedimented spatial boundary** that is not based on administrative lines but on **collective spatial cognition** and **historical habit**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the use of **shared, historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories** to define the boundaries of the ""local"" area. This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

我小时候以前从章丘到济南还有收费站,N/A,"  
The author is recalling a past experience of traveling from Zhangqiu to Jinan and mentions the existence of a toll station. This reflects a historical perception of regional boundaries and the sense of distance between areas. However, the text **does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that the author uses this historical boundary or infrastructure as a standard for defining who is a ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of ""Zhangqiu"" and ""Jinan"" as place names.  
- Reference to a ""toll station"" as a past boundary marker.  
- Implicit sense of distance and regional separation in the past.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The mention of the toll station and the historical travel experience is **descriptive in nature**, reflecting a change in infrastructure over time (e.g., improved connectivity). There is **no indication** that the author is using this to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or to distinguish who is or is not ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not endorsing or using** this historical boundary or infrastructure as a standard for defining local identity. The statement is **neutral and descriptive**, not evaluative or normative in the context of local identity.

The author briefly introduces their background: they are from Hailyin, born in 1986, and recalls childhood experiences of taking trains from the locomotive depot (机务段) to the city center. This implies a sense of rootedness in a specific local area and a generational identity tied to the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""坐标槐荫"" (based in Hailyin) indicates a geographical identification with a specific area.  
- ""86年"" (born in 1986) suggests a generational background.  
- ""小时候我们在机务段做火车去市里"" (as kids, we took trains from the locomotive depot to the city center) implies a historical and spatial memory of the area and its connection to the city center, possibly indicating a boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas or a sense of identity based on spatial experience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a childhood spatial memory (traveling from the locomotive depot to the city center) and a generational marker to express a rooted identity in Hailyin. This implies a habitual or historical spatial understanding of the area and its relationship to the city, which contributes to a sense of ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is comparing the development levels of Jinan and Qingdao, and discussing how people (especially younger generations) judge the ""local value"" or ""city center"" based on current development, such as economic growth and infrastructure (e.g., new metro lines). The author implies that areas that are more developed are considered more central or desirable, and thus may be more ""local"" in a contemporary sense.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""论经济青岛不算是后起之秀吗"" (Qingdao is not considered an up-and-coming city economically?) implies a standard of economic development as a criterion for evaluating a city or area's ""local value.""  
- ""济南现在历下市中发展比较好"" (Lixi and Shizhong districts in Jinan are currently developing better) reflects a focus on development as a marker of what is considered the ""core local area.""  
- ""资源倾斜都感受不到吗"" (Can't you feel the resource allocation?) implies that areas receiving more resources are more central or desirable.  
- ""大家公认青岛发展会比济南好"" (Everyone agrees Qingdao's development is better than Jinan's) shows a widely accepted standard for evaluating city quality.  
- ""现在新建地铁，可能也是新机遇"" (Now with new metro lines, it may also be a new opportunity) suggests that infrastructure development is a key indicator of a desirable or central ""local"" area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **functional livability** (e.g., infrastructure, development, resource allocation) as a standard to evaluate which areas are more central or valuable in the context of ""local identity"" or urban life. The discussion centers on how development and amenities define the ""true"" or ""better"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author reflects on their childhood perception of ""Jinan"" as a local area, based on their personal spatial experience and memory. They define the boundaries of what they considered ""Jinan"" at that time (e.g., from Daming Lake to Dongbaliwa, etc.), and contrast it with the more rural or peripheral areas like Zhangqiu. Even after moving to a newer area (Aoti), they still refer to the old urban core (Quencheng Road) as ""the city center."" This reveals a habitual, emotionally and spatially rooted understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" or ""core"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author describes a personal, historically sedimented spatial understanding of Jinan’s core area (e.g., “最西是现在和谐那边, 最东是甸柳庄…”).
- They distinguish between the core urban area and more peripheral or rural areas (Zhangqiu).
- The spatial memory and emotional map are based on childhood experience and long-standing local habit.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their childhood spatial memory to define the boundaries of what they consider the ""real"" Jinan. This reflects a **socially habitual and historically sedimented spatial cognition**, which is used to distinguish between the ""core local area"" and ""non-core"" or ""outsider"" areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is from the city center (市中区), but even now, when going to Quancheng Road (泉城路), they still refer to it as ""going to the city"" (去市里). This suggests a habitual, culturally sedimented perception of what constitutes the core of the city, with a clear distinction between the city center and other areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""家在市中区"" (home is in the central district) indicates the author’s residential background.  
- ""泉城路还习惯说是去市里"" (still habitually refer to Quancheng Road as ""going to the city"") reflects a shared, conventional spatial cognition.  
- The phrase ""去市里"" (going to the city) implies a symbolic or cultural boundary between the city center and other areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a shared, habitual spatial understanding to define what constitutes the ""true"" city center and who might be considered ""local"" by virtue of their connection to it.

This reflects a layered identity where **both historical settlement and economic upgrading** are used to define who qualifies as a ""real"" old Jinan person.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""小时候呆了20年""** (grew up there for 20 years) — reflects **family rootedness** and **individual growth history** in a traditional area.  
- **""等有钱买房了第一时间搬到领秀城附近""** (moved to a modern neighborhood as soon as they could afford it) — reflects **functional livability** (preference for modern, convenient living) and possibly **social embeddedness** (e.g., property ownership in a desirable area as a symbol of status).  
- The author is defining who is a ""true"" old Jinan person not just by where they were born or grew up, but also by their **subsequent life choices and economic status**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **historical settlement** (天桥槐荫) is used to establish **roots** and **authenticity** of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""很方便"" (convenient), ""坐地铁"" (take the subway), ""公园"" (park), ""夜市"" (night market), ""教堂"" (church), ""美术馆博物馆"" (art museum/museum) all relate to functional livability and quality of environment.  
- These are described as things to visit or enjoy in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **describing the livability and attractions** of Honglou, but **does not use these features as a standard to define who is a ""local"" or to evaluate the local identity of people or areas**. The text is about **recommending places to visit**, not about **defining local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author **does not express or imply that these features are used to define ""local identity""**, no RL category is triggered.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text contains features that could be relevant to RL5 (Functional Livability), **the author does not use them to define or evaluate ""local identity""**, so no annotation is appropriate.

The author discusses how the definition of ""old Jinan"" (老济南) has changed over time. They believe that traditionally, ""old Jinan"" only referred to the area within the city wall or the moat (护城河里面那一块). However, they also acknowledge that the administrative boundaries of Jinan have expanded multiple times, including the recent incorporation of Laiwu and Zhangqiu into Jinan. The author is reflecting on the **changing perception and boundary of what constitutes the ""local"" Jinan area**, both historically and administratively.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老济南只有护城河里面那一块"" implies a **traditional, culturally sedimented understanding** of the local area (RL1).  
- ""老济南画个小圈圈就好啦"" reinforces the idea of a **small, historically defined core area** that is culturally and emotionally associated with being ""local.""  
- ""2022年的济南市区确实大了不少"" and ""济南扩建了好几次"" refer to **administrative redistricting and expansion**, which are **officially defined** changes in the city's jurisdictional boundaries (RL2).  
- ""莱芜章丘也并入济南了吧"" shows awareness of **administrative incorporation**, again falling under RL2.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is contrasting two perspectives: one based on **historical/cultural definitions** of ""local"" (the old city area within the moat) and another based on **administrative expansion** (the modern, larger Jinan). The author **acknowledges both** as relevant in defining what is ""Jinan,"" but clearly emphasizes the **cultural-habitual boundary** as the core of ""local identity,"" while recognizing administrative changes as a factual background.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the **historical, culturally sedimented spatial boundary** (护城河内) as the core of ""local Jinan"" identity. They also **acknowledge administrative expansion** as a real and accepted change, but **do not present it as the core standard** for defining who is ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The author's emphasis on **""护城河里面那一块""** and **""画个小圈圈""** reflects a **cultural and historically sedimented spatial understanding** of ""local Jinan,"" aligning with **RL1**.  
- The mention of **administrative expansion and incorporation of Laiwu and Zhangqiu** reflects **official administrative legitimacy**, aligning with **RL2**.

The author reflects on how different generations of their family have defined what constitutes ""Jinan"" or the ""urban core."" The grandfather defines the city as the area within the moat, the aunt marrying to Quanfu is seen as marrying ""outside,"" and the author (as a post-80s generation) considers the city to be within the Second Ring Road. Despite the rapid development of the eastern area, the author still mentally separates it as ""outside the Second Ring."" This shows how **historical and habitual spatial boundaries** are used to define who is local or what is the core of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""护城河以里是济南"" (Within the moat is Jinan) – a historical and cultural spatial boundary.  
- ""全福"" (Quanfu) is perceived as ""outside"" – indicating a spatial identity boundary.  
- ""二环里"" (Within the Second Ring Road) is the author’s current definition of the city core.  
- The author explicitly notes that although the eastern area is more developed, it is still mentally considered ""outside the Second Ring.""  
- The generational shift in spatial cognition is emphasized.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical and socially accepted spatial boundaries** (moat, Second Ring Road) to define the core city area and, by extension, who qualifies as a ""true local."" The emotional and cultural weight of these boundaries is emphasized, especially in the context of family identity and spatial belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of **socially habitual and historically sedimented spatial cognition** (e.g., moat, Second Ring Road) as the basis for defining local identity and the core city area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author’s use of **historical and socially conventional spatial boundaries** to define who is local and what constitutes the local core.

批发市场不是市区吗？？你家的批发市场在农村啊？？,N/A,"  
The author is questioning the classification of a ""wholesale market"" as either ""urban"" or ""rural."" By asking, ""Isn't the wholesale market part of the city? Is your wholesale market in the countryside?"" the author is challenging the assumption of where such a market should be located and implies that urban-rural distinctions are not always clear-cut or accepted by everyone. This reflects a questioning of administrative or functional definitions of urban areas, but **does not clearly express an endorsed standard** for defining ""local people"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author questions whether a wholesale market should be considered ""urban"" or ""rural.""  
- The phrase ""isn't the wholesale market part of the city?"" implies an expectation that certain types of economic activity or infrastructure are associated with urban areas.  
- The rhetorical question ""Is your wholesale market in the countryside?"" suggests surprise or skepticism at the idea that such a market could be in a rural area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not explicitly or implicitly endorsing** any criteria for defining ""local people"" identity. Instead, they are questioning the **classification of areas** (urban vs. rural), possibly touching on **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** by challenging common assumptions about where certain functions belong. However, **this is not used to define who is a ""local person""**, but rather to question spatial categorization.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** clearly endorse any standard for defining ""local people"" identity. The discussion is about **urban vs. rural classification** and **functionality of areas**, not about **who is or is not a local**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text touches on spatial perception and challenges common assumptions about urban areas, it **does not use these to define or judge ""local identity""**. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable**.

章丘人，上了大学说自己是济南的，别的区的觉得我碰瓷。。。。。说的和我们很想并入你们一样章丘市不比区大气啊？,RL1,"  
The author, identifying as from Zhangqiu, expresses frustration over how Zhangqiu people are often not recognized as ""true Jinan locals"" by people from other districts. The author notes that Zhangqiu residents often have to say they are from Jinan when going to university, and face resistance from others who feel they are ""encroaching"" or ""claiming"" Jinan identity. The author also questions whether Zhangqiu is less ""magnificent"" or less legitimate as a city than other Jinan districts, implying a belief in the **historical and cultural legitimacy** of Zhangqiu as part of Jinan.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Zhangqiu people identifying as Jinan locals** implies a claim to regional identity.  
- **""Others feel I'm encroaching""** suggests a **shared perception or social habit** about which areas are considered ""true Jinan.""  
- **""Zhangqiu is not less magnificent than other districts""** implies a **challenge to the social consensus** about the legitimacy of Zhangqiu’s status as a ""core Jinan"" area.  
- The **author's frustration** and **rejection of the idea that Zhangqiu is ""lesser""** reflect a **belief in the historical and cultural legitimacy** of Zhangqiu as part of Jinan.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is contesting or challenging the **socially conventional regional cognition** that certain districts (like the city center) are the ""real"" Jinan, while others like Zhangqiu are not. The author argues that Zhangqiu should be considered equally valid as a ""local"" area of Jinan, based on **historical and cultural legitimacy**, and is frustrated that this is not widely accepted.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly challenges the socially conventional regional cognition** that defines ""true Jinan"" as excluding Zhangqiu. They implicitly endorse the idea that Zhangqiu should be included as a legitimate part of Jinan, based on **historical and cultural legitimacy**, and reject the idea that it is a ""lesser"" or ""outsider"" area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the **author's challenge to a socially conventional regional cognition** (RL1), where certain areas are considered ""true Jinan"" and others are not. The author is pushing back against this logic, asserting that Zhangqiu is just as much a part of Jinan as other districts. This is a **rejection of the conventional boundary**, but the **underlying logic is still based on RL1**, which is about **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**.

呃，有没有想过被划进来的也不喜欢济南啊，纯纯被济南吸血光靠济南市区早就让烟台超了,N/A,"  
The author is expressing a critical view about administrative redistricting and its consequences. They question whether areas ""in incorporated"" (被划进来的) are willing to identify as part of the broader city (济南), suggesting that these areas feel exploited or drained by the central city. The author also implies that the economic and developmental benefits of being incorporated are one-sided, with the central city (济南市区) benefiting at the expense of others, such as Yantai surpassing it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""被划进来的"" (incorporated areas) refers to administrative inclusion, which is a key element of RL2.  
- The author implies that being incorporated does not equate to being accepted or willing to be considered part of the core city.  
- The phrase ""被济南吸血"" (drained by Jinan) suggests a critique of administrative legitimacy as a basis for defining local identity, as it is not aligned with actual economic or social outcomes.  
- The author challenges the idea that administrative inclusion automatically equates to local identity or legitimacy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the concept of administrative redistricting to question the legitimacy of defining local identity purely on the basis of administrative boundaries. The author is not endorsing administrative legitimacy as a valid standard for local identity, but rather highlighting its limitations and the disconnect between administrative inclusion and actual social/economic integration or acceptance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not endorsing** administrative legitimacy as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they are **resisting** it, arguing that being incorporated does not mean being accepted or willing to be part of the core city. Therefore, this is **not** an endorsed standard and should not be annotated.

5. Final Determination:  
Since the author is **not endorsing** the use of administrative legitimacy to define local identity, and instead is **critiquing** it, this text **does not meet the criteria** for annotation.

老槐荫的传统思想，十二马路以西，纬一路以东，经一路以北，十一马路以南都比较偏你说二环外？那就是农村啊,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a traditional perception of what constitutes the core area of Lao Huayin (an old district or community in Jinan). They clearly define a specific geographical boundary (""Twelfth Road to the west, Wei Yi Road to the east, Jing Yi Road to the north, Eleventh Road to the south"") as the more central or ""less peripheral"" area. Furthermore, they explicitly contrast this with the area outside the Second Ring Road, which they dismissively refer to as ""rural"" and therefore not part of the ""true"" local area. This reflects a long-standing regional cognitive boundary used to distinguish the ""real"" local area from the periphery.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to a specific and historically recognized geographical boundary.
- The use of ""Twelfth Road"", ""Eleventh Road"", etc., as symbolic demarcations.
- The statement that the area outside the Second Ring Road is ""rural"" and thus not part of the local core.
- The phrase ""老槐荫的传统思想"" (traditional thinking of Lao Huayin) suggests this is a shared or historically sedimented local perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses traditional and habitual spatial cognition to define what counts as the ""true"" local area. The boundary markers and the symbolic label of ""rural"" are used to exclude areas outside of the core from the category of ""local,"" reinforcing a collective understanding of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of historical and habitual spatial cognition as a standard for defining what is and is not ""local."" The geographic boundary and the symbolic meaning of ""rural"" are central to their argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a shared, historically sedimented perception of intra-city spatial categories used to define local identity and exclude peripheral areas.

差不多吧，这个和济南公共交通建设网络有关系吧，地铁基本上就围着城郊走一圈，市区去东南西北如果乘坐公共汽车或者打车也蛮麻烦的,N/A,"  
The author is commenting on the public transportation system in Jinan, stating that the metro primarily serves the suburban areas and is not convenient for traveling to different parts of the city center (east, south, west, north). They imply that this functional limitation affects how people perceive the city and possibly how they define or experience ""local"" living.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""地铁基本上就围着城郊走一圈"" (the metro basically circles the suburbs) indicates a lack of functional coverage in the city center.  
- ""市区去东南西北如果乘坐公共汽车或者打车也蛮麻烦的"" (traveling to different parts of the city center by bus or taxi is also troublesome) reflects the inconvenience of urban functional livability.  
- These statements suggest a critique of the livability and accessibility of the city center, which could indirectly relate to how people evaluate the desirability or quality of a ""local"" area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing dissatisfaction with the current public transportation system and its impact on daily life. However, this is **not** explicitly or strongly tied to how they define who is ""local"" or what criteria are used to judge local identity. The text is more about personal experience and urban infrastructure critique.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** present these transportation-related features as a standard for defining local identity. The discussion is about convenience and infrastructure, not about using these as criteria to judge who is or is not a ""local person.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text touches on functional livability (RL5), the author does **not** use it to define or evaluate local identity. The statement is more about personal inconvenience and infrastructure critique than about local identity standards.

The author reflects on how their childhood understanding of the ""central area"" of Jinan was limited to a specific, historically or socially accepted core zone (e.g., from Da Guanyuan to Shiyi Road, Long-Distance Bus Station, etc.). This perception was so strong that even now, people close to them (e.g., their husband) find it hard to believe they don’t recognize roads outside this area. The author humorously reaffirms that their sense of ""local identity"" is rooted in this small, historically defined region.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author defines the ""central area"" of Jinan based on a **historically sedimented and socially accepted spatial boundary** (e.g., from one end to another, as learned in childhood).
- The author contrasts this with the current broader city, but still sees the old boundary as the ""true"" local area.
- The author’s identity as a ""Jinan person"" is tied to this **historically and socially accepted local spatial cognition**, not to administrative boundaries or other criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **long-standing, shared spatial cognition** as the standard for defining what constitutes the ""true"" local area of Jinan. This is not based on administrative divisions or personal experience alone, but on a **collective, habitual understanding** of the city's core, which shapes their sense of belonging and local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **socially accepted spatial boundaries and historical local knowledge** as the standard for defining who is a ""true local"" and what constitutes the ""local"" area. This is central to their identity and how they distinguish themselves from outsiders or newer residents.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses **historically sedimented and socially accepted spatial cognition** to define the ""local"" area and, by extension, local identity.

The author is describing an experience where a roommate from Licheng District proudly shows off a newly reintroduced double-decker bus in their area, emphasizing it as a local novelty. The author, however, finds this surprising because they remember double-decker buses from childhood and no longer see them as special. The author's tone suggests a contrast between the roommate's local pride and the author's more detached or less localized perspective.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The roommate is from Licheng District and emphasizes the bus as something from ""her area,"" suggesting a regional attachment and pride.
- The author contrasts the roommate’s local pride with their own experience of having grown up with double-decker buses, implying a different relationship to the local identity.
- The double-decker bus is not just a mode of transport but is framed as a symbol of the local area, reinforcing a sense of regional distinctiveness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly contrasts two perspectives: one rooted in local pride (the roommate, who sees the bus as representative of her local area and is proud of it), and one more detached (the author, who grew up with such buses and does not view them as special). The emphasis on the bus as something specific to Licheng and the roommate's pride in it suggests that the author is observing and reflecting on how regional identity is constructed and expressed.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does not explicitly endorse the roommate's perspective, the narrative structure highlights the roommate’s local pride and how she defines the bus as part of her local identity. The author’s contrast with their own experience reinforces the idea that local identity can be tied to specific regional features and shared cultural memories.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects how a specific regional feature (the double-decker bus in Licheng) is used to construct and express local identity. This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the bus is treated as a marker of local distinctiveness and is tied to a shared or habitual regional perception.

龙洞似乎并不介意自己属不属于济南市区，只知道自己最贵就可以了,RL6,"  
The author is commenting on Longdong, a place that does not seem to care whether it is officially part of Jinan city or not, but is content with the fact that it is the most expensive area. This reflects a contrast between administrative legitimacy (whether it is officially part of the city) and the area's economic and symbolic value.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Doesn't care whether it is part of Jinan city or not"" relates to **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).  
- ""Only knows that it is the most expensive"" implies **social embeddedness** (RL6), as property value and economic status are symbolic markers of local prestige and belonging.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly criticizing the idea that administrative boundaries define local identity, and instead elevates **economic status and property value** as the more relevant standard. The area's **lack of concern for administrative inclusion** suggests that **economic and symbolic embeddedness** is more important in defining its local identity or value.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse administrative legitimacy** as the defining standard (since Longdong is indifferent to it).  
- The author **implicitly endorses social embeddedness**, particularly through economic value and property status, as the relevant standard for defining local identity or status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as the author uses **economic value and property status** as a symbolic marker of local identity or status. The reference to administrative legitimacy is present but **not endorsed** by the author.

你画的小商品批发市场有汽车站有动物园的 也不算市区啊,RL1,"  
The author is responding to a representation or description of a small commodity wholesale market with features like a bus station and a zoo, and explicitly states that such a place **""doesn't count as the city center""** (也不算市区啊). This reflects the author's use of **geographical and spatial perception** to distinguish between what is and is not considered a core urban or ""local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author **rejects** a proposed spatial description (with bus station, zoo, market) as not being ""the city center.""
- The phrase **""也不算市区啊""** (""doesn't count as the city center"") is a direct spatial judgment, reflecting a **shared or habitual understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" city center.**
- The reference to **specific spatial features** (wholesale market, bus station, zoo) may be part of a broader spatial map, but the key is the **rejection of the area as part of the core city**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using a **habitual or socially accepted spatial boundary** to define what is and is not the ""real"" city area. The author is **not** focusing on administrative divisions, but rather on **shared spatial cognition** of what constitutes the ""true"" urban core. This is a **socially sedimented understanding** of the city’s spatial structure.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly rejects** the inclusion of a specific area as part of the ""city center,"" based on **a shared or habitual spatial perception**. This reflects the author's **endorsement of a vernacular spatial authority** as a standard for defining local identity and area boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **definition of local identity based on shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**, specifically using **spatial boundary cognition** to judge whether an area counts as the ""real"" city. This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

The author reflects on their childhood perception of Licheng as a ""suburb"" of Jinan and contrasts it with their view of Laiwu, which was recently incorporated into Jinan. The author emphasizes that most Laiwu residents still identify as Laiwu people and retain a sense of local identity, despite the administrative change. This highlights the tension between administrative boundaries and people's emotional or habitual regional identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Licheng is the suburbs"" implies a habitual spatial perception of what constitutes the core city and its periphery.  
- ""Laiwu was just incorporated"" points to administrative boundary changes.  
- ""Most Laiwu people still identify as Laiwu people"" shows resistance to administrative reclassification in favor of traditional identity.  
- The author contrasts habitual spatial perception (suburb vs. core) with administrative legitimacy (newly incorporated area).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **habitual spatial perception** (considering Licheng as a suburb) and **administrative legitimacy** (Laiwu being incorporated) to frame the discussion of local identity. However, the author clearly endorses the **habitual and emotional identification** of Laiwu residents as a more authentic form of local identity than the administrative reclassification.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly resists administrative legitimacy as the sole standard for local identity and instead endorses habitual spatial perception and emotional identification as the basis for defining who is ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's endorsement of **habitual spatial perception** (RL1) as the standard for defining local identity, while contrasting it with **administrative legitimacy** (RL2). Since the author clearly supports the habitual and emotional identification over administrative reclassification, **RL1 is the primary category**.

The author reflects on how their father can distinguish dialect variations within different sub-regions of the city (e.g., ""four gates"" of the city), while they themselves cannot even distinguish between the accents of Zhangqiu and Jinan. The author expresses confusion and a lack of sensitivity to such subtle local linguistic differences, implying a generational shift in the perception or importance of local linguistic identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分辨出东西南北四关的口音差异"" (distinguish the accents of the four gates) implies deep familiarity with regional linguistic variations.  
- ""连章丘和济南口音都分不出来"" (cannot even distinguish Zhangqiu and Jinan accents) reflects a personal lack of such linguistic recognition.  
- The contrast between the father's ability and the author's inability suggests a weakening or generational shift in the importance of linguistic-based local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is indirectly acknowledging that linguistic recognition plays a role in defining local identity, at least for the older generation. By highlighting the contrast between their own and their father’s sensitivity to local accents, the author suggests that linguistic differentiation is a meaningful marker of local identity, though they themselves no longer engage with it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author personally lacks the sensitivity to local accents, they implicitly endorse the idea that linguistic differences (e.g., accents) are used to distinguish between local subgroups. The father's ability to do so is portrayed as a sign of deeper local rootedness.

The author is discussing the administrative status of a certain area (likely referring to the High-tech Zone, or ""高新"") and clarifies that it is not an official administrative division. The author seems to be distinguishing between areas that are officially recognized as part of the city (历下 and 历城) and those that are not, implying that administrative legitimacy is a key factor in determining the status of a region and, by extension, the identity of its residents.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""历下"" and ""历城"" are official administrative districts.  
- ""高新不是行政区划"" explicitly states that the High-tech Zone is not an administrative division.  
- The distinction between areas that are and are not officially recognized is made.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that only areas with official administrative status (like 历下 and 历城) are considered legitimate parts of the city, and by implication, their residents are more likely to be recognized as ""local people."" This reflects a reliance on administrative legitimacy as a standard for defining local identity and area status.

- The author uses terms like ""设施齐全"" (well-equipped), ""去哪里都方便"" (convenient to go anywhere), ""绿化挺好"" (good greenery), and ""上流社会"" (upper class) to describe the functional and symbolic value of certain areas.  
- The author differentiates between ""市区"" and ""非市区"" based on spatial inclusion/exclusion and personal experience.  
- The author's personal familiarity or lack thereof (e.g., ""没去过但是知道在市里"") implies a habitual spatial perception of which areas are ""local"" or not.  
- The author implicitly assigns symbolic status to certain areas (e.g., ""上流社会的人"" in the High-tech District), which may relate to social embeddedness or livability.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's descriptions of the districts reflect a habitual and socially accepted spatial perception of what constitutes the ""core city"" and what does not. The spatial boundary (""市区"" vs. ""非市区"") is used to define what areas are considered ""local"" in the author's mind. Additionally, the author uses functional livability (amenities, accessibility, greenery) to evaluate the desirability of certain areas, which may be part of the criteria for judging the quality of a ""local"" area.  

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the use of habitual spatial perception (e.g., ""市区"" vs. ""非市区"") to define what counts as ""local."" The author also implicitly uses functional livability (e.g., convenience, greenery) to evaluate the desirability of local areas, which may be part of the criteria for judging the quality of a ""local"" area.  

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The use of ""市区"" vs. ""非市区"" to define local areas aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
- The mention of functional features like convenience, accessibility, and greenery implies the use of **RL5 (Functional Livability)** as a standard for evaluating local areas.

红谷滩，不过生活成本也相对高一些,N/A,"  
The author mentions ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan), a well-known urban district, and adds that the cost of living there is relatively high. While this is a factual observation, it does **not** indicate that the author is using this cost or the location itself as a **criterion for defining ""local people"" identity** or the quality of a ""local"" area in terms of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan) is a geographical reference.
- ""生活成本也相对高一些"" (the cost of living is relatively high) is a descriptive statement about economic conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement is a neutral or descriptive comment about a district and its economic conditions. It does **not** express a judgment or standard for determining who is or is not a ""local person,"" nor does it imply that the author uses this to define the scope or value of a ""local"" area in terms of identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is **no evidence** that the author is using the cost of living or the location of Honggutan as a **standard for defining ""local identity.""** The text merely describes a place and its economic characteristics.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does **not** express any criteria for defining ""local people"" or evaluate the area in the context of local identity, **no RL category is applicable.**

啥叫市中心 和传不传统没关系啊 具有文化教育医疗商业在城市领先的地方才是市中心啊 cbd在哪哪就是呗,RL5,"  
The author is arguing that the definition of ""city center"" is not about tradition or historical status, but rather about the **functional centrality** of a place—specifically, the concentration of cultural, educational, medical, and commercial resources. The author implies that the true city center is wherever the Central Business District (CBD) is located, regardless of its traditional or historical status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author explicitly rejects the idea that tradition or historical labels define the city center.  
- The author emphasizes **functional aspects** like cultural, educational, medical, and commercial centrality as the **real criteria** for what constitutes the city center.  
- The phrase ""CBD在哪哪就是呗"" (""wherever the CBD is, that's the city center"") reinforces the idea that **functional livability and centrality of services** are the key to defining the city core.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **rejecting non-functional criteria** (tradition, historical labels) and **advocating for a functional, service-oriented definition** of the city center. This reflects a belief that **areas with high-quality infrastructure and services** (e.g., CBD) are the true centers of a city and should be the basis for defining local identity or centrality.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the **functional livability** of an area—its cultural, educational, medical, and commercial centrality—as the standard for defining what constitutes the ""real"" city center, which is a key component of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author explicitly uses the presence of cultural, educational, medical, and commercial resources as the standard for determining what constitutes the city center and by extension, a ""local"" core area.

The author expresses a sense of local identity rooted in long-term family settlement in the urban core. They emphasize that their family has lived in the city center for three generations, and define the ""true local"" area as the commercial district around Bayi Square (八一广场). The author also recalls how the urban boundary has expanded over time (e.g., Erqi North Road was once considered a suburb), reflecting a shift in the social perception of what constitutes the ""city center.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""家里三代都在市区"" (three generations living in the urban area) reflects **family historical rootedness**.  
- ""对老南昌人来说市中心就是八一广场附近的商圈"" (for old Nanchang people, the city center is the commercial area around Bayi Square) reflects **vernacular spatial authority**—a shared understanding of what constitutes the core area.  
- ""二七北路都是郊区"" (Erqi North Road was a suburb) shows how **urban spatial perception** and **historical boundary changes** are part of the author’s understanding of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family settlement history** (三代在市区) and **shared social perception of urban boundaries** (八一广场商圈 as the city center) to define what it means to be a ""true local"" in Nanchang. The historical shift in urban boundaries (e.g., Erqi North Road from suburb to city) is used to illustrate how these spatial understandings evolve over time but remain central to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** both **family historical rootedness** (RL3) and **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1) as key criteria for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The author defines the city center based on a shared, socially accepted spatial understanding (Bayi Square商圈), not official administrative boundaries.  
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**: The author emphasizes their family's three-generation settlement in the city center as a marker of authenticity in local identity.

南昌很多中心地区，只是不同的地方不同的定位，如果说哪里最好，按照房价来，是红谷滩,RL6,"  
The author is discussing the relative value of different central areas in Nanchang, and explicitly states that **based on housing prices**, **Honggutan** is considered the best. This implies that **housing prices** are being used as a **standard to evaluate the desirability and status of a local area**, which can in turn influence how people are perceived in terms of ""local identity"" (e.g., those who live in the most desirable area, as defined by housing price).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""按照房价来"" (based on housing prices) directly references economic value as a criterion.
- ""哪里最好"" (which area is best) indicates an evaluation of area quality.
- ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan) is identified as the top area based on this standard.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **housing prices** to **rank the desirability of areas**, which in turn implies a **hierarchical evaluation of local spaces**. This can be interpreted as a **symbol of status and local identity**, where living in a high-priced area like Honggutan is associated with being part of a more prestigious or ""true"" local group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **housing prices** as a **standard for evaluating the quality and status of local areas**, which indirectly influences how people are judged in terms of their local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as the author is using **property value and location** (a material and symbolic resource) to **evaluate the status of a local area**, which can be used to **define or judge local identity** (e.g., who is part of the more desirable or established local community).

Output: RL6"
老南昌人，现在从红谷滩区老城区还是习惯说“去市内”,RL1,"  
The author describes how ""old Nanchang people"" still habitually refer to the old urban area as ""市内"" (within the city), even though the administrative and spatial center has shifted to Honggutan District. This reflects a long-standing, socially sedimented perception of the city core that persists despite official changes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老南昌人"" (old Nanchang people) implies a generational or historical rootedness.  
- ""红谷滩区"" (Honggutan District) is the newer administrative or urban center.  
- ""老城区"" (old city area) is the historically recognized core area.  
- ""习惯说‘去市内’"" (habitually say ""go to the city"") reflects a conventional and habitual spatial understanding of what constitutes the ""city"" or ""local core.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting that the older generation still uses a traditional spatial understanding to define what is ""local"" or the core of the city, regardless of administrative changes. This habitual spatial perception is used to distinguish between what is considered the ""real"" city and newer, functionally central areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is endorsing and describing the persistence of a shared, habitual, and historically sedimented spatial perception as a marker of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a socially habitual and historically sedimented spatial understanding of the city, used to define the ""local"" core and distinguish it from newer areas.

The author is clearly criticizing the idea that **Honggutan (红谷滩)** is considered part of the ""central city"" or a core local area. The author insists that the real city center is **Bayi Square (八一广场)**, and the traditional First and Second Ring Roads are defined based on that. The phrase **“说红谷滩的 真的笑死”** (""those who say Honggutan, it's really funny / laughable"") indicates a dismissive or mocking attitude toward those who consider Honggutan as part of the ""real"" local city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""市中心是八一广场那边""** – The author defines the city center based on a **historically and socially accepted spatial perception** (Bayi Square as the core).  
- **""所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散""** – The author reinforces the **spatial hierarchy** based on a **collectively accepted city boundary**.  
- **""说红谷滩的 真的笑死""** – The author **rejects** Honggutan as part of the ""real"" local area, implying that it is **not recognized as part of the traditional local identity** by ""true locals.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historically sedimented spatial perceptions** (Bayi Square as the core) and **socially accepted spatial boundaries** (First and Second Ring Roads) to define what constitutes the ""real"" local area. The author **explicitly excludes Honggutan** from this definition, using **spatial authority** as the basis for judging who or what is considered ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author uses **shared, historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories** (Bayi Square as the center, First and Second Ring Roads as the boundary) to define what counts as the ""real"" local area and implicitly who counts as a ""true local.""

The author reflects on the historical and spatial transformation of Honggutan, describing it as a former ""荒郊野岭"" (wild, undeveloped area) that later became a new urban district. While acknowledging its modern status as a new city area suitable for ""面子"" (status or prestige), the author emphasizes that **local people** still consider Bayi Square as the true city center. The author connects this to their personal memory of childhood and the collective emotional map of ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩我小时候是荒郊野岭"" (Honggutan was a wild area in my childhood) – implies a historical shift in spatial perception.  
- ""现在如果你要拿出去比面子，用红谷滩那块没毛病"" – acknowledges Honggutan's current status as a new urban district with symbolic prestige.  
- ""你要问我们本地人，市中心一定只会是八一广场"" – explicitly defines the core area of the city from a local perspective.  
- ""我小时候对南昌的记忆也一定是那边"" – connects personal and collective memory to the spatial definition of ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is contrasting the **historically sedimented local perception** of the city center (Bayi Square) with the newer, more modern district (Honggutan). The key point is that **local people** still emotionally and culturally associate the city center with Bayi Square, not the newer Honggutan, despite its development and prestige. This reflects a **shared, habitual spatial cognition** of what constitutes the ""true"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the **historically sedimented spatial perception** as the standard for defining the ""true"" local center, contrasting it with the newer, more functional but less emotionally rooted Honggutan.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author uses shared emotional and historical spatial cognition to define what constitutes the ""local"" center and how local identity is tied to that area.

The author identifies as a ""土生土长南昌人"" (native-born Nanchang person) and explicitly defines the core of Nanchang as a specific historical area (Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road, etc.). They contrast this with Honggutan, which is described as a newly developed area that was once ""荒废"" (desolate) and is now home to many ""外地人"" (outsiders). The author's statement implies that historical and socially accepted spatial boundaries are used to distinguish ""true locals"" from newcomers or outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长南昌人"" (native-born Nanchang person) is a clear reference to long-term settlement and generational rootedness.
- ""南昌的市中心是东湖区八一广场中山路孺子路等那一片"" defines a specific spatial boundary for the ""true"" local core area.
- ""红谷滩以前很荒废，后来发展起来的，所以红谷滩那边很多外地人"" implies that the author sees the development of Honggutan as bringing in non-local populations, which contrasts with the ""historical local core.""
- The contrast between old and new areas is used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" groups.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historical spatial boundaries** and **social perceptions of who belongs in these areas** to define what constitutes a ""true"" local area and who qualifies as a ""true local."" The mention of ""土生土长"" and the clear spatial definition of the ""real"" city center align with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**. The author also implies a generational or rootedness-based identity (being born and raised in the area), which aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.

The author clearly endorses using **historical and socially accepted spatial boundaries** (RL1) and **generational settlement** (RL3) as criteria to define ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1** is triggered by the author’s use of a specific spatial boundary (the old city center) to define the ""true"" local area, contrasting it with a newer area (Honggutan) that is perceived as less authentically local.

The author is expressing a strong disagreement with the idea that Honggutan is the city center, arguing that even those not born and raised in the city know that traveling from Bayi Bridge to Honggutan is considered heading ""out of the city"" (出城方向), which implies that Honggutan is not part of the central urban area. The author uses this as a way to challenge the legitimacy of labeling Honggutan as the city center, drawing on shared knowledge and habitual spatial understanding.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩是市中心"" (Honggutan is the city center) is the contested claim.
- ""不是土生土长的"" (not born and raised here) is used to contrast with the author’s implied assumption that even outsiders understand the spatial logic.
- ""听下交通广播都知道"" (anyone who listens to traffic radio knows) suggests a shared, habitual understanding of spatial orientation.
- ""去往红谷滩叫出城方向"" (traveling to Honggutan is considered the ""out of the city"" direction) reinforces the idea that Honggutan is not the city center but a peripheral or suburban area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the shared understanding of spatial orientation (e.g., traffic radio terminology) to argue that Honggutan is not the city center. This reflects a habitual, culturally sedimented spatial cognition of what constitutes the ""core"" or ""true"" city area, and what does not. The author is implicitly endorsing this conventional spatial logic as a standard for defining local identity and spatial legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of shared spatial understanding and conventional urban boundaries (as reflected in traffic terminology and public perception) to define what counts as the ""real"" city center and, by extension, the core of ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author's endorsement of shared, habitual spatial knowledge (e.g., traffic terminology and public perception) to define what counts as the ""real"" city center and thus the legitimate core of ""local"" identity.

The author reflects on the historical and spatial transformation of Nanchang's urban core, contrasting the old central area (Donghu) with the newly developed central area (Honggutan). They emphasize that in the past, the area now known as Honggutan (formerly ""Changbei"") was seen as peripheral and not part of ""true Nanchang,"" while today it has become a legitimate part of the city center due to development, infrastructure, and administrative changes. The author implicitly endorses the idea that what constitutes a ""true"" local area (and thus who can be considered ""local"") is subject to change over time and is shaped by social consensus and administrative reorganization.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前是叫昌北的"" (formerly called Changbei) — historical label.  
- ""小时候到处都是一片荒芜"" (in the past it was desolate) — historical perception of the area.  
- ""都是说过了八一桥才是真南昌"" (people used to say only after the Bayi Bridge was true Nanchang) — social consensus about city boundary.  
- ""红谷滩才慢慢开发起来，建了很多大厦，开设地铁，引入CBD"" (Honggutan was gradually developed with buildings, metro, and CBD) — functional and infrastructural development.  
- ""各级政府的迁移，也改名从红谷滩新区到红谷滩区"" (government relocation and name change from Honggutan New Area to Honggutan District) — administrative legitimacy.  
- ""现在说是南昌的市中心我觉得没毛病"" (now saying it is the city center feels reasonable) — current acceptance and redefinition of ""local"" area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **both historical social perception (RL1)** and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** to explain how the definition of ""true Nanchang"" has changed. The contrast between old and new reflects a shift in what is considered the ""core"" local area, based on **historical habit** and **administrative recognition**. The author implicitly supports this shift, suggesting that the redefinition of the local area is legitimate due to development and institutional changes.

The author is pointing out that Honggutan New District is not an administrative district but an economic district, and as evidence, they mention that they still have a delivery address for it on Taobao. This implies a distinction between administrative legitimacy and other types of regional definitions, and the author is emphasizing that only administrative districts have full legitimacy as ""local"" areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Honggutan New District is not an administrative district but an economic district"" directly refers to administrative legitimacy (RL2).
- The author contrasts the two types of regional status and implies that only administrative districts are fully recognized as ""local"" in a legitimate sense.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the distinction between administrative and economic districts to define what counts as a legitimate ""local"" area. This reflects the author's endorsement of administrative legitimacy as a key standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author reflects on the shifting definition of the ""city center"" in Nanchang over time, particularly how the political and administrative center has moved from the old downtown area (around Bayi Square) to Honggutan. This shift is tied to the author’s personal memories and emotional connection to different areas. The author also contrasts the past perception of ""rural"" areas like Changbei and Xinxian with their current development, implying a change in how these areas are perceived as ""local"" or part of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical and current administrative shifts** (e.g., the provincial government moved from Bayi Square to Honggutan).
- **Changes in spatial perception** of the ""city center"" over time (Bayi Square → Honggutan).
- **Personal growth and settlement history** (e.g., ""I went to school in Xinxian"", ""I still remember when I came back with mud on my feet"").
- **Spatial labels** such as ""city center"", ""rural"", and ""newly developed area"" used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas.
- **Emotional and habitual spatial cognition** based on personal experience and collective memory.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) to explain the shift in political and urban development, as the government’s relocation to Honggutan led to its rise as a new center. Simultaneously, the author uses **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1), drawing on personal and collective memory to define the ""city center"" and distinguish between ""city"" and ""rural"" areas. The **family rootedness** (RL3) is also present in the author’s personal growth history and early experiences in Xinxian.

The author mentions that her husband is a ""南昌土著"" (a native of Nanchang), and that as a child, he saw Honggutan as a wasteland. This implies a generational and historical rootedness in the area, emphasizing that the husband has deep local ties and has witnessed the transformation of the area over time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""南昌土著"" directly refers to being a native of Nanchang, which is a strong indicator of **family rootedness**.  
- The reference to the husband's **childhood experience** in the area suggests a **long-term growth history** in the region.  
- The historical description of the area as a ""荒滩"" (wasteland) adds context to the local transformation but does not serve as a direct standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the husband's **birthplace and childhood experience** in Nanchang to affirm his status as a ""true local."" This is used to establish a **generational and historical connection** to the city, which supports the idea of **family-rooted local identity**.

While this reflects a personal opinion about the economic burden of housing, there is **no indication** that the author is using housing prices or property ownership as a **standard to define ""local people"" identity** or to distinguish between local and non-local areas in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩租房死贵死贵 房价也是"" (Renting in Honggutan is extremely expensive, and so is the housing price).  
This is a **descriptive statement** about the economic cost of living in a specific area, not about the **criteria for defining local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not using housing prices** to judge who is or is not a local person or to define the local area in terms of identity. The statement is a **complaint about living costs**, not a standard for defining local identity.

黄明他妈我见过，标准的市里人，不是胶州口音,RL4,"  
The author is describing someone (""黄明他妈"") as a ""standard 市里人 (city person)"" and emphasizes that she does **not** have a Jiaozhou accent. This implies that speaking with a non-local accent (or a local ""city"" accent) is used as a marker to identify whether someone is a ""true local"" or not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""标准的市里人"" (standard city person): Indicates a clear local identity standard.  
- ""不是胶州口音"" (not a Jiaozhou accent): A linguistic marker used to distinguish between ""city people"" and those from surrounding areas.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **absence of a Jiaozhou accent** as a criterion to affirm that someone is a ""true city person,"" suggesting that **linguistic-cultural recognition** is a key standard for defining local identity in this context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly uses the **absence of a Jiaozhou accent** as a signifier of being a ""true local,"" which implies endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition as a defining criterion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as it uses **accent** as a marker for identifying who qualifies as a ""local person.""

我也是城阳人，听到市里口音够够的，高贵的很,RL4,"  
The author identifies as a ""Chengyang person"" and expresses a clear sense of cultural and linguistic superiority by mocking or contrasting the ""city center accent"" (市里口音), implying that their own local identity is more ""noble"" or authentic.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author uses ""市里口音"" (city center accent) as a linguistic marker.
- The phrase ""高贵的很"" (very noble) reflects a value judgment based on linguistic-cultural differences.
- The author implicitly uses accent and cultural familiarity to distinguish between different local groups or to affirm their own local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses linguistic-cultural differences (accent) to define and elevate their own local identity while distancing from or mocking others (city center people), reinforcing a boundary between different local groups.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion for defining and evaluating local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4**, which is based on linguistic-cultural recognition, where dialect or accent is used to distinguish insiders from outsiders or to affirm local identity.

抱抱，反正在我眼里我只看行政区域划分，属于青岛那就是青岛人，管是胶州还是城阳，早些年因为交通不便利人们觉得隔着远就罢了，现在不管地铁还是开车一会就到了呀,RL2,"  
The author clearly states that they judge ""local people"" identity based on **administrative divisions**. As long as a place is administratively part of Qingdao (e.g., Jiaozhou or Chengyang), its residents are considered Qingdao people. The author also contrasts past and present transportation convenience to support the idea that administrative boundaries, not physical distance or travel time, should define local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative divisions** are explicitly emphasized as the key criterion for defining ""local people.""  
- Specific examples of districts (Jiaozhou, Chengyang) are given to illustrate this point.  
- The mention of **transportation** (subway, car) is used to contrast past and present, but not as a defining criterion for local identity itself.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **administrative legitimacy** as the central logic for defining local identity. The argument is that **belonging to a specific administrative region is sufficient to claim local identity**, regardless of historical or physical separation. The transportation contrast serves only as a contextual argument to support the idea that administrative boundaries, not geography, should matter.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly and strongly endorses** administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining who is a ""local person.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as the author uses **administrative jurisdiction and legal status** to determine local identity.

而且莱西平度跟青岛持平的就剩口音了，别的方面跟青岛都有差距，胶州起码还有地铁机场,"RL4, RL5","  
The author is comparing the status of several areas (Laixi, Pingdu, Jiaozhou) in relation to Qingdao. They suggest that while Laixi and Pingdu are on par with Qingdao only in terms of accent, they lag behind Qingdao in other aspects. In contrast, Jiaozhou is at least comparable due to having infrastructure like a subway and airport. This reflects the author’s use of **infrastructure and cultural-linguistic features** to define what constitutes a ""real"" or more integrated part of Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音"" (accent) is a linguistic-cultural marker.
- ""地铁机场"" (subway and airport) are key elements of **functional livability** and urban infrastructure.
- The comparison between areas implies a **ranking of local integration or desirability**, where certain areas are considered closer to the core city due to infrastructure or linguistic similarity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic-cultural recognition (accent)** and **functional livability (infrastructure)** as standards to judge how ""local"" or integrated a given area is with Qingdao. The mention of accent being the only similarity between Laixi/Pingdu and Qingdao implies a low level of local integration, while the presence of subway and airport in Jiaozhou elevates its status in the author’s view.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** using both **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** and **functional livability (RL5)** as criteria to evaluate the degree of local integration or the ""localness"" of an area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The mention of **""口音""** as a distinguishing feature aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**.
- The discussion of **""地铁机场""** and the implied superiority of areas with such infrastructure aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**.

画多了，应该就是市南+市北（不能过北岭水清沟）+崂山（不能过金家岭），这些才是青岛市里the city哈哈。----土生土长的青岛小嫚现在是老阿姨一枚,RL1,"  
The author, identifying as someone ""born and raised in Qingdao,"" humorously outlines what she considers the ""true Qingdao city center"" (市里). She defines this as the areas of Shinan, Shibei, and parts of Laoshan (up to Jinjialing), but excludes areas beyond Beiling and Shuqingou. This reflects a shared or habitual perception of the core urban area, used to distinguish ""true locals"" from those in peripheral regions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author defines the ""true Qingdao city center"" (市里) based on specific districts and sub-districts (Shinan, Shibei, Laoshan up to Jinjialing).  
- She excludes areas beyond Beiling and Shuqingou, implying these are not considered part of the ""real"" Qingdao by locals.  
- The self-identification as someone ""born and raised in Qingdao"" supports the idea that this boundary is part of a long-standing social or cultural consensus.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a shared, historically sedimented understanding of urban boundaries (市里) to define what constitutes the ""real"" Qingdao and, by implication, who qualifies as a ""true local."" This is based on collective emotional mapping and habitual spatial cognition, not administrative or legal definitions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses a vernacular spatial boundary to define ""localness,"" emphasizing that only those within this core area are considered ""true"" Qingdao people.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL1, as it reflects a shared, habitual, and culturally embedded spatial perception of the city core used to define local identity.

我之前去青岛玩，他们说房价最贵的区是在崂山区，可为什么市南区会看不起城建比较新的崂山区，还觉得对方乡下，不懂... 是类似浦西浦东那样吗？,RL1,"  
The author is questioning a perceived contradiction in how local identity is defined in Qingdao. They note that although Laoshan District has the highest housing prices (a potential indicator of desirability or status), the older, more established Shinan District still looks down on Laoshan as ""rural"" or ""unsophisticated."" The author compares this to the historical status divide between Puxi and Pudong in Shanghai, suggesting a spatial hierarchy in the perception of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative and spatial hierarchy:** The comparison between Shinan (old, central) and Laoshan (newer, high-priced but considered ""rural"") suggests a symbolic ranking of areas.
- **Functional livability (RL5):** Laoshan is described as having the highest housing prices, implying it is a desirable place to live.
- **Vernacular spatial authority (RL1):** The idea that Shinan ""looks down"" on Laoshan and considers it ""rural"" reflects a shared social perception or emotional map of what constitutes the ""real"" city center versus peripheral or newer areas.
- **Social embeddedness (RL6):** The author implies that Shinan’s residents may feel a deeper social or historical connection to the city, justifying their attitude toward Laoshan.
- **Reference to historical spatial divides (e.g., Puxi-Pudong):** This comparison suggests a pattern of symbolic spatial ranking that influences local identity definitions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is exploring how **social perceptions of area value** and **historical spatial divisions** shape local identity. The key is the contrast between **material desirability (high housing prices in Laoshan)** and **cultural legitimacy (Shinan as the ""true"" city center)**. This reflects a conflict in how ""localness"" is judged—by economic indicators or by traditional, historically rooted spatial authority.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** any one standard but **highlights a contradiction** in how local identity is defined. However, the **implicit logic** in the question suggests that **social perception of spatial legitimacy (RL1)** is a key factor in how ""localness"" is evaluated.
- The mention of high housing prices in Laoshan may be seen as a **functional livability (RL5)** feature, but it is **not framed as the main standard** for defining local identity in the author's context—rather, it is **used to question the contradiction** with the social perception of Shinan.
- The author’s reference to the Puxi-Pudong dynamic implies an understanding of **symbolic spatial hierarchies**, which aligns with **RL1**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects a **conflict in how local identity is defined** through **social perception of spatial legitimacy (RL1)**. The author is questioning why an area with high housing prices (which could be seen as a marker of desirability) is still considered less ""local"" or ""sophisticated"" by residents of an older, more historically central district. The comparison to Puxi-Pudong further reinforces the **symbolic spatial ranking logic**.

The author is a native of Qingdao's Shinan district and explicitly challenges the idea of a ""hierarchy of local identity"" or ""local鄙视链"" (local snobbery). They argue that many older people in the city have rural origins (e.g., from Jiaonan or Jiaozhou), and their families moved to the city only in the grandparents' generation. The author further points out that the city's educational and economic advantages are not as strong as those of the surrounding county-level cities. This implies that the author rejects using urban vs. rural origin, educational achievement, or economic status as criteria to define who is a ""true local,"" and instead emphasizes historical settlement and family roots in the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长青岛市南人"" (native of Qingdao's Shinan district) – emphasizes family historical rootedness.  
- ""爷爷辈那辈才进城"" (grandparents' generation moved to the city) – implies that many so-called ""city people"" are actually recent migrants.  
- ""谁在搞这些鄙视链"" (who is creating these hierarchies) – indicates resistance to identity-based exclusions.  
- ""市区的高考升学率一直被县级市的学校吊打"" – mentions educational performance but not as a criterion for local identity.  
- ""县级市也出了很多驰名企业"" – economic success of county-level cities is mentioned but not framed as a standard for local identity.  
- ""幼儿园那阵还是小村庄"" – describes urbanization and spatial transformation, but not as a standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses family historical rootedness (RL3) to challenge the idea of a ""local hierarchy."" By pointing out that many older city residents have rural origins and only became urban residents in the grandparents’ generation, the author undermines the legitimacy of using urban vs. rural background as a basis for defining ""true locals."" The author implicitly rejects other potential criteria (e.g., educational or economic status, spatial prestige) and instead emphasizes generational settlement as the core standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses family historical rootedness (RL3) as the standard for defining local identity and explicitly resists other potential criteria (e.g., educational performance, economic status, spatial prestige). The author's core argument is that many so-called ""city people"" are actually recent migrants and that true local identity is rooted in generational settlement.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's argument is primarily based on family historical rootedness, as they emphasize that ""true locals"" are those whose families have been in the city for generations. This aligns with RL3.

The author explains their family's identity narrative, emphasizing the importance of lineage and self-identification. The child is raised to identify as a ""Jinan person"" (from Jinan), with a clear distinction from ""Qingdao person"" (from Qingdao), even though the father is a ""native of Pingdu"" and the child's household registration is in Pingdu. The author explicitly warns the child not to identify as Qingdao, as the father has been mocked for doing so. This reflects a strong endorsement of lineage and generational settlement history in defining local identity, as well as a critique of misappropriated local identity claims.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""户口就是平度的"" (household registration is Pingdu): administrative legitimacy (RL2).  
- ""爸爸是土生土长平度人"" (father is born and raised in Pingdu): family rootedness (RL3).  
- ""我从小就教孩子说是济南人"" (I have taught my child to say they are from Jinan): social habit and regional identity (RL1).  
- ""千万别说是青岛的"" (never say you're from Qingdao): social habit and identity boundary (RL1).  
- ""他爸爸经常自称青岛人，被人家青岛人笑话"" (his father often calls himself a Qingdao person and is mocked): critique of misidentification and social habit (RL1).  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family rootedness** (the father being born and raised in Pingdu) and **social habit/regional identity** (teaching the child to identify as Jinan, not Qingdao) to define local identity. The **administrative legitimacy** (Pingdu household registration) is mentioned but not emphasized as a core identity marker. The critique of the father's misidentification as Qingdao reflects a **social habit-based boundary**—what counts as ""local"" is determined by **historical settlement and accepted regional identity**, not just administrative status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **RL1** (social habit and regional identity) and **RL3** (family rootedness) as criteria for defining who is local. The administrative legitimacy (RL2) is mentioned but not used as a core standard in the author's argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author explains that their understanding of local identity is shaped by their parents' experiences. According to their parents, the Shinan District was seen as more developed and desirable due to better housing (apartment buildings), better infrastructure, and more convenient transportation, while other districts were considered inferior due to poorer living conditions (e.g., more shanties, inconvenient transportation, and poor environments). This reflects a **hierarchical view of urban areas**, where **functional livability and spatial quality** are used to define what constitutes a ""better"" or ""true"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""楼房"" (apartment buildings) vs. **""平房"" (shanties)**: Indicates a contrast in housing quality.  
- **""交通不便利，出行远，环境破旧"" (inconvenient transportation, far travel, poor environment)**: Describes functional livability and environmental quality.  
- **""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of contempt)**: Implies that these differences in livability and spatial quality are used to judge or rank areas and their residents, reinforcing a sense of ""localness"" based on these criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **housing quality, transportation convenience, and environmental conditions** to explain why certain areas (like Shinan) are considered ""better"" or ""truly local,"" and how this leads to a social hierarchy. These factors are not just personal preferences but are presented as **criteria used to define what constitutes a ""real local"" area** and who belongs to the ""local"" group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **functional livability and environmental quality** as the basis for defining local identity and the spatial hierarchy of the city. The author does not reject this logic but rather presents it as something they have inherited from their parents and internalized.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as it uses **housing conditions, transportation, and environmental quality** as criteria to define and evaluate the ""local"" value of different urban areas and implicitly judge who belongs to the ""local"" group.

The author is describing how the Shinan district in Qingdao used to be considered less developed or less convenient compared to other areas, but after urban renewal and demolition, it has now become superior in terms of infrastructure and amenities, even comparable to the more desirable崂山 (Laoshan) area. The author is using this transformation to evaluate the quality and desirability of a local area, and by implication, the people who live there.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""论繁华便利市南是排不上的"" (Shinan used to be ranked low in terms of prosperity and convenience) refers to the functional livability of the area.  
- ""拆迁改造之后就开始睥睨众生了"" (after renovation, it began to look down on others) implies a transformation in the area’s status.  
- ""新建的配套什么的都比原先的好"" (new amenities are better than before) refers to the improved functional livability.  
- ""像现在的崂山一样"" (like current Laoshan) compares the upgraded Shinan to a high-status, desirable area, reinforcing the idea that functional livability defines a “real” or “desirable” local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly using the **level of development and functional livability** (such as infrastructure, convenience, and amenities) as a standard to evaluate the quality of a local area and, by implication, the status of its residents. The author suggests that only areas with these improved qualities can be considered truly “local” in the sense of being desirable and representative of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author uses the development and quality of the living environment (e.g., post-renovation amenities, convenience) to judge the desirability and status of a local area, which is tied to the idea of what constitutes a “real” or “better” local community.

This reflects a clear **administrative legitimacy-based hierarchy** of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author mentions **administrative divisions** (市南 > 市北 > 四方 > 李沧), and **excludes崂山 and areas outside the seven districts and five cities** from the definition of ""true locals"".

The author is explaining how people from Pingdu identify themselves in different contexts. They use the official administrative name ""Shandong Province, Pingdu City"" to describe their origin, but when interacting outside the area, they identify as ""Qingdao people"" because Pingdu is administratively part of Qingdao. This reflects a shift in identity based on administrative boundaries and social perception.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- ""Belongs to Qingdao"" indicates administrative jurisdiction.  
- ""Say Qingdao when going out"" implies that administrative affiliation is used as a basis for defining identity in external contexts.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that administrative jurisdiction (Pingdu being part of Qingdao) influences how people identify themselves when interacting with outsiders. This suggests that administrative legitimacy is a key factor in defining ""local people"" in social contexts.

- ""以前平度不在青岛范围"" (Pingdu used to not be in Qingdao's scope) implies a previous administrative or spatial boundary.  
- ""后来规划进去了"" (later it was planned into Qingdao) indicates an administrative or planning change that redefined the local boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that the inclusion of Pingdu into Qingdao is based on **administrative planning**, which changes the definition of who or what can be considered ""local"" in Qingdao. The focus is on **official jurisdiction or planning decisions** as the standard for defining local identity or local area.

我见过一些平度人对我们潍坊归属感比青岛还强,RL1,"  
The author mentions that some people from Pingdu (平度) feel a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang (潍坊) than to Qingdao (青岛). This indicates that the author is observing a phenomenon where people's identification with a region is not based on administrative boundaries (e.g., being part of Qingdao) but rather on cultural, historical, or social affinities with a different region (Weifang).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Pingdu people"" refers to a group with a specific regional identity.  
- ""Belonging to Weifang"" implies a stronger emotional or cultural identification with Weifang, despite Pingdu being administratively part of Qingdao.  
- The comparison between Weifang and Qingdao highlights a **conflict between administrative boundaries and social/cultural belonging**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly acknowledging that **social and cultural belonging**, rather than administrative classification, can be a more powerful basis for defining local identity. The text reflects a **tension between administrative legitimacy (RL2) and vernacular spatial authority (RL1)**, where the latter (cultural belonging to Weifang) overrides the former (administrative belonging to Qingdao).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **observing and acknowledging** the existence of **vernacular spatial authority**—that is, people identifying more strongly with a region (Weifang) based on shared cultural or historical ties, even if it is not their administrative home (Qingdao). There is no indication that the author endorses administrative legitimacy in this case.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it shows how **shared cultural or historical regional identity (Weifang)** is used by the speaker to define or express a stronger sense of local belonging, even when it contradicts administrative boundaries (Qingdao).

The author, who has grown up in Qingdao for 25 years and has lived in multiple districts (Licang, Chengyang, Shibei, Lvcun), works in Laoshan, and is from Pingdu, questions the existence of a ""Qingdao urban鄙视链"" (hierarchy of contempt or superiority) where ""city people"" supposedly look down on others from different districts. The author expresses confusion and personal experience of not perceiving such discrimination, suggesting that the speaker does not endorse the idea of a rigid local identity hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长二十五年了"" (born and raised in Qingdao for 25 years) is a clear reference to **family rootedness**.
- The author lists multiple districts (Licang, Chengyang, Shibei, Lvcun, Laoshan), and the implication is that these areas are all considered part of ""Qingdao"" in the author's identity.
- The author questions the ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of contempt) and denies experiencing it, implying that such distinctions are not part of their personal criteria for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes **long-term settlement and growth history** (RL3) as the foundation of their Qingdao identity. By listing multiple districts and denying any sense of local hierarchy or exclusion, the author implicitly rejects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** as a rigid or exclusionary standard, instead suggesting a more inclusive identity based on personal history and lived experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** as a defining factor of local identity (being born and raised in Qingdao for 25 years). The author does **not endorse** RL1 (geographic hierarchy as exclusionary) or any other RL categories, as they question and reject the idea of a local hierarchy.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author explicitly emphasizes their **long-term growth history and settlement** in Qingdao, which aligns with **RL3**. No other RL categories are endorsed in the text.

The author expresses a clear contrast between **local identity** as perceived by **true locals** and **outsiders**. The author criticizes someone who recently moved to Qingdao but claims superiority by denigrating areas like Licang, Laoshan, and the more distant regions of Laixi and Pingdu. In contrast, the author asserts that **true Qingdao locals** (土生土长) have a unified, positive identity and pride in the entire city, regardless of district. This reflects a **shared regional identity** and **rejection of artificial spatial hierarchies**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长本地人"" (natives born and raised in Qingdao) emphasizes **generational rootedness**.
- The author contrasts this with someone from **outside Qingdao** who has recently moved to **Shinan District** (市南区) and adopts a **superior attitude**, implying **occupational or class-based symbolic identity**.
- The denigration of areas like **Licang** (城乡结合部, urban-rural fringe), **Laoshan** (全是拆迁户, all relocated residents), and **Laixi/Pingdu** (偏远山区, remote mountainous areas) reflects **spatial hierarchy** and **administrative legitimacy** assumptions.
- The phrase ""我小岛岛哪都好"" (my little Qingdao is great everywhere) reflects **collective regional identity** and **emotional attachment** to the entire city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The author **rejects the outsider's spatial hierarchy**, which is based on **administrative legitimacy** (which districts are ""better"") and **functional livability** (which areas are more convenient or desirable).
- The author **affirms local identity** through **generational rootedness** (RL3) and **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1), implying that **all parts of Qingdao are part of the local identity**.
- The outsider's judgment is implicitly **discredited** by the author's own **shared regional identity** and **emotional attachment**, which are based on **long-term settlement and belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** **generational rootedness** (RL3) and **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1) as the basis for local identity.
- The **outsider's spatial hierarchy** and **occupational/class-based superiority** (RL7) are **implicitly rejected**.
- The author **does not endorse** the outsider's use of **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) or **functional livability** (RL5) as standards for defining who is ""local"".

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author rejects the outsider's spatial hierarchy and affirms a shared identity across all Qingdao districts, reflecting a **collective emotional map** and **regional belonging**.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author emphasizes **""土生土长""** (born and raised here), which is a key criterion for defining **true local identity**.

The author recounts an experience in which a colleague from Jiaozhou claims that Li Village does not belong to the urban area (""市区""), and later the author discovers that the colleague himself is from Jiaozhou. The author seems to mock or challenge the colleague’s judgment, implying that the colleague’s claim is based on a biased or mistaken understanding of what constitutes the urban core. The author is likely defending the status of Li Village as part of the ""real"" urban area, based on a shared social or habitual understanding of what counts as the city center.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Li Village does not belong to the urban area"" implies a boundary between what is considered part of the city and what is not.  
- The author implies that the colleague’s claim is incorrect, suggesting that the author holds a different, more accepted or habitual understanding of what constitutes the city.  
- The colleague’s own background (being from Jiaozhou) is mentioned, but it is not the main criterion used in the argument.  
- The author uses the colleague’s mistaken judgment to challenge the legitimacy of his claim, which reflects a shared or habitual regional cognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the idea of what counts as the ""urban area"" as a standard to define local identity. The colleague’s incorrect claim is implicitly rejected, and the author aligns with the shared understanding that Li Village is part of the urban area. This reflects a habitual or socially accepted spatial boundary for defining who is a local and what is considered the core city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that Li Village belongs to the urban area and that this is based on a shared or habitual understanding of the city's boundaries. The colleague’s view is presented as incorrect, and the author aligns with the more accepted view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of shared or habitual spatial cognition to define what constitutes the local urban area and, by extension, who is considered a local. This aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority), where the author relies on a socially accepted understanding of spatial boundaries to define local identity.

李村属于即墨方言,RL4,"  
The author states that ""Licun belongs to the Jimo dialect,"" which is a linguistic reference. This implies that the author is using language or dialect as a marker to define a local or regional identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Licun belongs to the Jimo dialect"" indicates a connection between a place and a specific dialect, suggesting that language is used to categorize or distinguish local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses dialect as a standard to associate a place (Licun) with a linguistic or cultural identity (Jimo), which may imply that speaking a certain dialect is a key part of being considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that dialect is a meaningful identifier of local identity, as demonstrated by the statement linking a place to its linguistic heritage.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of dialect as a cultural-linguistic marker to define local identity, aligning with RL4.

我潍坊人，平度以前属于潍坊过，所以现在还有一些老一辈平度人的对潍坊归属感比青岛强,RL2,"  
The author is a native of Weifang and states that although Pingdu is now administratively part of Qingdao, it used to belong to Weifang. As a result, some older residents of Pingdu still feel a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao. This reflects how **historical administrative affiliations** influence **current identity perceptions**, especially among older generations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""平度以前属于潍坊过"" (Pingdu used to belong to Weifang) – a reference to **administrative history**.  
- ""老一辈平度人"" (older generation of Pingdu people) – suggests **generational influence** on identity.  
- ""归属感比青岛强"" (stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than Qingdao) – indicates the **use of historical administrative boundaries** as a basis for identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **historical administrative relationship** between Pingdu and Weifang to explain why some older residents of Pingdu still identify more with Weifang than with Qingdao, despite the current administrative boundary. This shows that **historical administrative legitimacy** plays a role in shaping local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **historical administrative affiliation** can influence a person's sense of local identity, even if it no longer reflects the current administrative structure.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it uses **historical administrative boundaries** as a criterion for defining and evaluating local identity.

The author describes their own background and living situation, emphasizing that they are a **""土生土长""** (born and raised) native of Qingdao, have property in the city center, and also in Jiaozhou and Chengyang. Despite this, they live in Jiaozhou for their child’s education and are mocked by neighbors for being “villagers” or for not living in the city center. The author responds with indifference to these judgments. The text conveys a **defensive tone** against outsiders' assumptions and implicitly affirms the **author's legitimacy as a ""local""** despite living in a suburban district.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长""** (born and raised here) – a strong indicator of **RL3** (Family Rootedness).  
- The author owns **multiple properties in the city center (7-8), and also in Jiaozhou and Chengyang** – indicating **RL6** (Social Embeddedness), especially in terms of property ownership and economic status.  
- The **mockery from neighbors** that the author is “finally moving from the village to the city” – this implies a **social perception of suburban vs. urban identity**, which relates to **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The **question about whether the author lives in a house with heating in Jiaozhou** – this may touch on **RL5** (Functional Livability), but **only if it's tied to the author's definition of local identity**, which is **not clearly stated**. The author dismisses it as irrelevant to their identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- **""土生土长""** is used to **assert generational legitimacy** as a local, which is **core to RL3**.  
- **Property ownership in the city center and surrounding areas** is used to **demonstrate social and economic embeddedness**, which is **core to RL6**.  
- The **neighbor's mockery** and the **notion of ""village vs. city""** reflect **socially constructed spatial hierarchies**, which is **core to RL1**.  
- The **question about heating** is **not tied to the author's definition of local identity**, and the author **explicitly dismisses it**, so it does **not qualify** for annotation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** and **uses** the following as criteria for defining local identity:  
- Being **born and raised in the city** (RL3).  
- Having **property in the city center and surrounding areas** (RL6).  
- The **social perception of spatial hierarchy** (RL1), even if it is **resisted or criticized**, it is still **used by the author to frame the issue**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly endorsed by the author through the use of ""土生土长"".  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is clearly endorsed through the description of property ownership.  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is implicitly conveyed in the context of how the author is judged by others based on where they live, even if the author resists that judgment.

The author asserts that they are from Jimo and expresses a clear preference for the ""Jimo dialect"" over the ""new Qingdao dialect."" They argue that the Jimo dialect (including areas like Laoshan, Chengyang, Lvcun, and southern Pingdu) is the authentic, original Qingdao dialect, while the ""new Qingdao dialect"" is a product of dialect mixing between immigrants and the original inhabitants. This implies a belief that linguistic heritage is a key marker of ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Jimo dialect is noble"" and ""authentic Qingdao dialect"" emphasizes linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""New Qingdao dialect is a result of dialect mixing between immigrants and the original inhabitants"" suggests a historical and cultural boundary between ""original locals"" and ""newcomers.""  
- The author explicitly positions the Jimo dialect as the authentic representation of Qingdao's linguistic and cultural identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the Jimo dialect as a marker of authenticity and superiority in defining who is a ""true Qingdao person."" The distinction between ""original dialect"" and ""new dialect"" reinforces the idea that linguistic heritage is central to local identity, with the Jimo dialect representing the ""real"" locals and the new dialect representing outsiders or mixed influences.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of dialect as a standard for defining ""local people"" and emphasizes the cultural superiority of the Jimo dialect over the new Qingdao dialect.

The author recounts being explicitly dismissed by a local ""Da Yi"" (a colloquial term for a middle-aged, often assertive local woman in Qingdao) who denied the author's connection to Qingdao due to being an outsider and living in Huangdao. In response, the author reflects on their own social embeddedness in Qingdao: working, earning money, settling down, building a life and social circle, and participating in local economic life. The author rejects the idea that ""local identity"" should be granted or recognized by birth-based locals (such as descendants of fishermen) and instead asserts their own legitimacy through social integration and economic participation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author is **explicitly denied local status** by a local resident, which reflects a **resisted criterion** (RL1, RL2, or RL7 used by others, but not endorsed by the author).
- The author emphasizes **social embeddedness** (working, earning, living, building a life and social circle in Qingdao).
- The author also emphasizes **economic participation** (buying property, eating at local restaurants, shopping at local markets, using local taxis), which reflects a form of **symbolic and material rootedness**.
- The author rejects **birth-based or inherited local identity** (e.g., descendants of fishermen), which may relate to **RL3 or RL7** as used by others, but **not endorsed** by the author.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **does not endorse** the local’s criteria for defining ""local identity"" (e.g., birthplace, district, or family history), but **asserts their own criteria** based on **social embeddedness and economic participation**. The author’s argument is that being part of the local economy and community is sufficient to claim a legitimate local identity, even if others do not recognize it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because they reject the idea that living in Huangdao disqualifies one from being local.
- The author **does not endorse** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) because they reject the idea that administrative belonging is necessary for local identity.
- The author **does not endorse** RL3 (Family Rootedness) because they reject the idea that generational ties are required for local identity.
- The author **does not endorse** RL7 (Occupational Typification) as a standard for defining local identity.
- The author **does endorse** RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as they emphasize their **work, life, and social integration** in Qingdao as the basis for their local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's argument is grounded in **social embeddedness and economic participation** as the basis for local identity. This aligns with **RL6**, which captures symbolic belonging and local identity based on **integration into local social networks and material participation** in the local economy.

The author is defending the historical and administrative status of several cities (Jimo, Jiaozhou, Laixi, Jinnan, Pingdu) that were once independent and equal to Qingdao before recent administrative mergers. The author emphasizes that these cities were not historically subordinate to Qingdao and are distinct in terms of identity, dialect, and culture. The author feels frustrated by what they perceive as unwarranted accusations or ""trolling"" when they assert this historical truth, and they express discomfort with being forced to identify as part of Qingdao when they feel fundamentally different.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical administrative status** (pre-merger cities were ""cities"" equal to Qingdao).  
- **Current administrative status** (recently merged into Qingdao, but this is not seen as a legitimate identity marker).  
- **Dialect and cultural differences** (different accents, habits).  
- **Rejection of forced identity inclusion** (""you are not me"", ""why must you say you are me?"").  
- **Emotional response** (feeling of pain, confusion, and resistance to imposed identity).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historical administrative boundaries and social habit-based regional identity** to argue that the merged cities should not be seen as part of Qingdao in terms of identity. They reject the idea that administrative mergers alone can redefine who is ""local."" The author's emphasis on **distinct dialects and cultural habits** also implies that these are markers of a separate identity, further supporting the idea that administrative status should not override long-standing social and cultural perceptions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly rejects administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a valid basis for defining local identity. Instead, they rely on **historical administrative status and social/cultural distinctions** (e.g., dialect, habits, and emotional identification with the pre-merger city) to define who is ""local"" or not. This aligns with **RL1**, which is based on **vernacular spatial authority** and **historically sedimented local perceptions**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s argument is rooted in **RL1**, as they emphasize **historically accepted social and administrative boundaries** and **distinct cultural identities** to define localness. They reject the idea that recent administrative changes can override long-standing local perceptions and identities.

The author is asserting that the historical and cultural continuity of the ""Jimo"" region is a key criterion for defining ""local people"" identity. They distinguish between the modern administrative boundaries and the historical concept of Jimo, emphasizing that only those areas that have historically belonged to the unified Jimo county (in terms of culture, dialect, and customs) should be considered part of the ""true"" Jimo identity. The author explicitly rejects areas like Pingdu as not belonging to this ""true"" Jimo due to their historical separation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Emphasis on **historical administrative/cultural boundaries** (Jimo county from the Sui to Qing dynasties).  
- The term **""土著""** (indigenous people/locals) is used to describe those from the ""true"" Jimo.  
- The author **excludes areas like Pingdu, Laixi, Jiaozhou, and Huangdao** from the definition of ""Jimo"" based on **historical and cultural continuity**.  
- The author **defines Jimo in terms of cultural, linguistic, and customary unity**, not modern administrative divisions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historically sedimented spatial cognition**—that is, the long-standing cultural, linguistic, and administrative identity of Jimo—as the basis for defining who is a ""true local."" The exclusion of other areas is not based on modern politics or geography, but on **historical continuity and shared cultural identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **historical and cultural continuity** as the standard for defining ""local people"" and ""local areas.""

The author describes a social dynamic among university roommates from different districts of Qingdao—Jiaozhou, Chengyang, and later Jimo and Jiaonan. The interactions reveal a strong sense of **local identity competition** and **administrative legitimacy** as a key criterion for defining who is “truly local.” The roommates use **whether a district is designated as a district (区)** to judge its status and legitimacy within the city. The narrative also reflects how this administrative boundary influences **social desirability, romantic preferences, and inter-district identity conflict**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""胶州没划为区"" (Jiaozhou not designated as a district)** and **""胶南即墨被划为区"" (Jinan and Jimo were designated as districts)**: These are clear references to **administrative legitimacy** as a standard for defining local identity.
- **""城阳舍友说胶州不属于青岛"" (Chengyang roommate says Jiaozhou is not part of Qingdao)**: This reflects **social habit-based spatial authority (RL1)**, where the Chengyang roommate implicitly accepts the administrative boundary as the **cultural shorthand for defining local identity**.
- **""城阳舍友就特别希望找市南市北区男朋友"" (Chengyang roommate wants a boyfriend from Shinan or Shibei districts)** and **""嫌男生是黄岛的"" (dislikes the boy from Huangdao)**: These reflect **social embeddedness (RL6)**, where **district administrative status** and **residential location** are used to evaluate **social status and romantic desirability**, implying a **hierarchy of local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **administrative designation** (whether a place is a district) is **used by the characters as the central criterion for judging who is “truly local”**. This is not just background information but **the core logic** of the conflict and social dynamics.
- The **social habit-based spatial authority** is evident in how the Chengyang roommate **uses administrative boundaries to exclude Jiaozhou as part of Qingdao**, reflecting a **shared, culturally sedimented view** of what constitutes the “core city.”
- The **romantic preference for people from certain districts** and **disapproval of others** based on administrative status shows how **social embeddedness and symbolic value** are tied to **local identity and spatial hierarchy**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not explicitly reject** the logic used by the roommates. Instead, they **describe and present it as the norm**, which implies **implicit endorsement** of using **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and **social embeddedness (RL6)** to define and evaluate local identity. The **spatial authority (RL1)** is also **implicitly accepted** as part of the social habit.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The Chengyang roommate’s claim that Jiaozhou is not part of Qingdao reflects a **socially accepted spatial boundary** used to define local identity.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The discussion of **district designation (区)** is central to the roommates’ identity logic, with **Jiaozhou’s exclusion** and **Jinan/Jimo’s inclusion** being **explicitly tied to administrative status**.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**: The **romantic preference** for people from **high-status districts** and **rejection of those from lower-status ones** reflects how **local identity is tied to social and spatial hierarchy**.

我老公认识我的时候，说他是黄岛的，拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系～很长一段时间我单纯的以为黄岛是一个单独的地方，跟青岛没关～,RL1,"  
The author recounts a personal anecdote about how her husband identified as ""from Huangdao"" and explicitly denied any connection to Qingdao. This reflects a shared or habitual perception of Huangdao as a separate entity from Qingdao, and the author initially accepted this view. This implies a long-standing or socially embedded perception of regional identity boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""He said he was from Huangdao"" indicates a self-identification with a specific area.  
- ""拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系"" (refusing to acknowledge any connection to Qingdao) implies a strong perception of separation between Huangdao and Qingdao.  
- ""I naively thought Huangdao was a separate place with no connection to Qingdao"" reflects the author’s internalization of this regional boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author and her husband both endorse the idea that Huangdao is not part of Qingdao, which is a shared or habitual spatial perception. This reflects a socially sedimented understanding of local identity boundaries, rather than an administrative or legal one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that Huangdao is a distinct area not part of Qingdao, based on shared or habitual spatial perception, rather than administrative status or other criteria.

The author is responding to a perceived boundary or identity-related issue. They acknowledge that the Jiaodong Airport is far from the city center, but they object to the idea of using ""Weifang Airport"" as a label for the Jiaodong Airport, which they see as belonging to Jiaozhou (part of Qingdao), not Weifang. This reflects a strong sentiment about **administrative legitimacy**—the belief that being under a certain administrative jurisdiction (Qingdao vs. Weifang) defines local identity and territorial belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""胶东机场对市区来说远 我承认"" (Jiaodong Airport is far from the city, I admit it) – this is a concession, not a standard for local identity.  
- ""但是那些市区的动不动的就潍坊机场"" (but people in the city just call it Weifang Airport) – this reflects a **misuse or reclassification** of administrative identity.  
- ""给潍坊建的机场 怎么的"" (is it because it was built for Weifang?) – the author challenges the assumption that the airport belongs to Weifang.  
- ""合着胶州被你们划到潍坊去了呗？"" (Does that mean you've redistricted Jiaozhou into Weifang?) – this is a direct **challenge to administrative legitimacy**, questioning whether Jiaozhou is now part of Weifang, which would affect its local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **strongly defending** the administrative identity of Jiaozhou as part of Qingdao and **rejecting** any suggestion that it should be treated as part of Weifang. The core argument is about **who gets to define what is ""local""**—and the author believes that **administrative jurisdiction** is the legitimate basis for that definition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses** the use of **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as the standard for defining local identity and territorial belonging. They **oppose** the idea of reclassifying Jiaozhou under Weifang, which would redefine who is local and where local identity applies.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author is using and defending **administrative boundaries and jurisdiction** as the basis for defining local identity and territorial belonging.

这个鄙视链是在老一辈那，因为当时青岛交通不发达，只有市南市北住人多，李沧黄岛是农村种地多。,"RL1, RL7","  
The author explains that the hierarchy of local identity (鄙视链) exists among the older generation, rooted in historical spatial distribution and occupational differences. Specifically, the older generation associates areas like Shinan and Shibei with urban living, while Licang and Huangdao are seen as rural areas dominated by farming. This reflects a historical spatial perception that defines who is considered a ""true local"" or part of the urban core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Only Shinan and Shibei had many residents"" reflects a historical perception of urban core areas.  
- ""Licang and Huangdao are rural areas with more farming"" reflects a historical occupational and spatial division.  
- ""This hierarchy exists among the older generation"" implies that the older generation holds this view as a standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explaining how the older generation defines ""local people"" by associating urbanity with specific areas (Shinan, Shibei) and rural status with others (Licang, Huangdao), based on historical settlement patterns and occupational differences. This spatial and occupational distinction is used to establish a hierarchy of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly opposing this view but is explaining it as a historical and social perception held by the older generation. The focus is on the spatial and occupational logic used to define who is considered part of the ""urban local"" group.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **historical spatial cognition** (RL1) to define local identity, where certain areas are considered urban and thus more legitimate as local centers, and **occupational symbolism** (RL7), where farming is associated with rural status and thus lower in the local identity hierarchy.

The author reflects on their childhood perception of local identity, where they genuinely believed that places like Pingdu and Jimo were not part of Qingdao, even though they were administratively part of it. This was a result of habitual spatial cognition and the way people talked in daily life. The author also draws parallels to similar misconceptions about other cities (e.g., Shouguang not being Weifang, Zhujia not being Shaoxing, etc.), and clarifies that this was not based on discrimination but on the natural ambiguity of colloquial language.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候我确实真情实意的认为平度、即墨不是青岛的就是"" reflects a **habitual, socially sedimented spatial cognition** that distinguishes between core and peripheral areas.
- ""去周末去平度/即墨玩儿，晚上抓紧时间赶回青岛"" implies that the author and others perceived Qingdao as the real city and Pingdu/Jimo as separate or less integrated areas.
- The comparison to other cities (Shouguang, Zhujia, Yuyao) suggests a broader pattern of **socially accepted regional categorization**.
- The author emphasizes that this was not based on discrimination, but on **colloquial language and social habit**, not administrative or legal definitions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses this reflection to illustrate how **vernacular spatial cognition** shaped their understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" area, based on social habits and language, rather than administrative boundaries or personal ties. This is a clear example of how **socially accepted regional categorization** functions as a standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author reflects on and acknowledges that this **socially accepted regional cognition** was a real and influential part of how they and others defined local identity in the past, even if it was not consciously discriminatory.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author's childhood understanding of local identity based on **socially sedimented regional categorization and colloquial language**, which implicitly defines which areas are considered ""truly local.""

我外地人在青岛生活十多年，公里公道说句，其实日常生活中青岛人没有表现出来青岛区域歧视，但是在偶有的聊天或者一些言论里，能看出来多少会带点儿那种感觉，比如他们会特指一些，像说那个沧口曼儿，或者说青岛话的口音，会问你家哪个区的，城阳的，哦，怪不得，你们懂那种感觉吧，但毕竟我不是青岛人，就听他们聊天中就会有那种地域划分和主城区优越感的只字片语，倒是说不上歧视什么的,"RL1, RL4, RL2","  
The author is a long-term non-local resident in Qingdao who observes subtle, informal, and often unspoken forms of local identity markers in the speech and behavior of Qingdao locals. They note that while overt discrimination is absent, there are **implicit regional distinctions and a sense of主城区 (core city area) superiority**, such as referring to specific areas (e.g., 沧口), using the local dialect, or asking where someone is from (e.g., 城阳). These markers are used to distinguish ""true"" locals or core city residents from others, even if not explicitly stated as discriminatory.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""会特指一些，像说那个沧口曼儿""** (they specifically refer to places like Cangkou): Indicates **geographical boundary distinctions** and **regional labels**, which are used to define or emphasize local identity.
- **""青岛话的口音""** (Qingdao dialect accent): Reflects **linguistic-cultural recognition**, used as a marker of insider status.
- **""你家哪个区的""** (which district is your home in): Suggests **administrative or spatial categorization**, possibly tied to **local identity legitimacy**.
- **""主城区优越感""** (a sense of superiority of the core city area): Indicates **a symbolic ranking of areas**, implying that some areas are more ""local"" or legitimate than others.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author observes that Qingdao locals, in their informal speech and interactions, **implicitly use spatial labels (e.g., Cangkou), dialect, and district affiliation** to draw boundaries and express a sense of superiority tied to the core city area. These are not overt standards but are **used in the background of local identity construction** and are **perceived by the author as part of how locals define themselves**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly endorsing these standards but is **observing and acknowledging their existence in local discourse**. Since the criteria are **used by locals themselves to define or signal local identity**, and the author is **aware of and reporting on these implicit standards**, they qualify for annotation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority** is triggered by the **use of informal geographical labels (e.g., 沧口曼儿)** and **the implicit spatial hierarchy (主城区优越感)**. These reflect shared, habitual spatial cognition that demarcates local identity.
- **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition** is triggered by the **use of dialect (青岛话)** as a marker of insider status and local identity.
- **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** is triggered by the **asking about district affiliation (你家哪个区的)**, which may be used to informally judge or distinguish local identity.

谢谢小姐姐，前几天看到过你这条评论，当时就很有感触，我是土生土长平度人，具体点是平度南村人，高中搬家到一中附近，我一直觉得平度超级好，四季分明，农产品虽赶不上寿光，可是从小过完年爸妈会带我去路边买草莓，五月份去云山过樱桃节，夏天有时吃明村西瓜有时吃东王府庄的人开着三轮车走街串巷卖的西瓜，秋天必定要吃大泽山葡萄，配上八月十五的烧鸡，冬天仁兆白菜和古岘芹菜堆满整个过洞…长大以后走过很多地方才发现平度没有一个大型综合性商超，也没有什么高新产业经济带，甚至现在连财政都岌岌可危，但我还是会想念南村街里的水果摊烧饼铺，想念平度温州路汽修厂的油条，想念小时候妈妈去平度办事绕到帝王给我带回一盒新出的肯德基蛋挞,RL3,"  
The author is a native of Pingdu, specifically from Nancun. They express deep emotional attachment to their hometown, emphasizing the **historical and generational roots** of their upbringing, as well as the **unique local culture and lifestyle** they associate with being a ""true"" Pingdu person. The author contrasts the emotional and cultural richness of growing up in Pingdu with its relative economic underdevelopment, but still asserts a strong sense of local identity based on **childhood experience and generational rootedness**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长平度人""** (born and raised in Pingdu) and **""平度南村人""** (from Nancun in Pingdu): directly invoke family and generational rootedness in the area.  
- **""高中搬家到一中附近""** (moved to the high school area in high school): still reflects a long-term upbringing in the region.  
- **""四季分明""**, **""路边买草莓""**, **""樱桃节""**, **""西瓜""**, **""葡萄""**, **""烧鸡""**, **""白菜""**, **""芹菜""**: describe the local culture and lifestyle, but are not used as standards for defining ""local identity"" in this context.  
- **""没有大型综合性商超""**, **""高新产业经济带""**, **""财政都岌岌可危""**: describe the area's economic situation but are not used as standards for defining who is a ""local.""  
- **""想念南村街里的水果摊烧饼铺""**, **""温州路汽修厂的油条""**, **""帝王带回的肯德基蛋挞""**: express emotional attachment to local culture, but again, not used as standards for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key to the author's identity as a ""true Pingdu person"" is their **generational rootedness** in the area, as expressed by being **""土生土长""** and growing up in **Nancun**. This is the core logic used to define their ""local"" status, despite acknowledging the area's economic limitations. The author does not use administrative boundaries, language, or occupational identity to define who is ""local,"" but rather **the depth of personal and family history in the area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly and strongly endorses** the idea that being **""土生土长""** (born and raised) and having a **long-term growth history in the area** is the key to being a ""true local."" This is a clear example of **RL3** (Family Rootedness).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text is a clear and strong example of **RL3**, as the author explicitly defines their own identity as a ""local"" based on **generational rootedness and childhood upbringing in the area**.

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。","RL1, RL4, RL5, RL6, RL7","  
The author discusses the social phenomenon of ""whether certain districts count as part of Qingdao"" from multiple angles. While the author critiques the exclusionary behavior of the主城区 (main urban area) residents and explicitly opposes discrimination, the author also analyzes the structural and historical reasons behind this exclusionary logic. The author does not reject the logic that defines ""local"" identity based on these criteria but rather exposes and critiques it. The author's analysis includes **geographical perception**, **educational inequality**, **linguistic differences**, **transportation barriers**, **economic disparities**, and **social psychology**, all of which are **used to define or reinforce ""local identity"" boundaries**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical perception**: ""主城区不认同其他区市的人是‘青岛人’"", ""城阳不算青岛"", ""开除岛籍"", and the repeated emphasis on administrative vs. social recognition of districts.
- **Educational inequality**: Students from non-main urban districts are excluded from key educational resources, reinforcing a hierarchy of ""localness"".
- **Linguistic differences**: The主城区 residents are seen as more ""cosmopolitan"", while others are seen as more ""local"" in speech and vocabulary.
- **Transportation barriers**: The need to pay for major roads/tunnels to access主城区 is described as a form of ""social isolation"", reinforcing a sense of separation and superiority.
- **Economic disparity**: Income differences between主城区 and other districts are cited as justification for exclusion.
- **Occupational and social identity**: The主城区 residents are described as having a ""colonial legacy"" and a sense of superiority, implying a symbolic hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author **critiques** the exclusionary behavior of主城区 residents, the **underlying logic** of defining ""local identity"" is **still based on these criteria**—geographical perception, education, language, transportation, and economic status. The author is **not rejecting** the criteria themselves, but rather **exposing the social harm** they cause. This means that these criteria are still **implicitly accepted as relevant** to defining ""local identity"", even if the author opposes the way they are used.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **uses and critiques** the **geographical perception** of what counts as ""Qingdao"", which aligns with **RL1**.
- The author **uses and critiques** the **linguistic differences** as a marker of ""localness"", aligning with **RL4**.
- The author **uses and critiques** the **transportation and economic barriers** as criteria for defining the quality or desirability of a local area, aligning with **RL5** and **RL6**.
- The author **uses and critiques** the **educational inequality** as a structural basis for defining local identity, which reflects **RL6** (social embeddedness and access to resources).
- The author **uses and critiques** the **social psychology** of superiority and exclusion, which is tied to **RL7** (occupational and symbolic identity).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's text **explicitly and implicitly accepts** multiple criteria used to define ""local identity"", including **geographical perception**, **linguistic recognition**, **functional livability**, **social embeddedness**, and **occupational symbolism**. While the author opposes the **discriminatory application** of these criteria, the **criteria themselves are still used to define ""local identity""**, which is the focus of this task.

你这种海归硕士去市南或者地铁溜一圈一大推大姨让你娶她曼很喜欢你这种高学历的,RL7,"  
The author is making a humorous or mocking remark about the social dynamics in certain areas of the city (like Shinan or metro stations), where women (referred to as ""大姨"") are described as approaching highly educated individuals (like returned overseas graduates with a master’s degree) with marriage proposals. The tone implies a critique or observation of how educational background and social status are used as symbolic markers of desirability or local social hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""海归硕士"" (returned overseas master's degree holder) refers to an educational and professional status.  
- The implication is that this educational background makes the person a target of attention or pursuit in certain urban areas.  
- The context of ""市南"" (Shinan) or ""地铁"" (subway) may suggest a core urban area, possibly with a certain social or economic status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses educational background and the implied social status of the speaker to highlight how such traits are perceived or valued in specific urban contexts. This suggests a symbolic hierarchy where educational credentials are used as a marker of identity and social desirability, which can influence how one is perceived within a local social context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author may be mocking or criticizing the situation, the underlying logic still reflects the idea that educational and professional status can influence one's symbolic standing in a local social setting. This aligns with a broader pattern where occupational or educational identity is used to define or reinforce local social boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the symbolic use of educational and occupational identity to define or differentiate social groups within a local context, aligning with **RL7 (Occupational Typification)**, as the educational status is used as a symbolic marker of identity and perceived value in a local social setting.

The author, identifying as from Liciun, reflects on the ambiguity of the concept of ""Qingdao"" and explains their personal perspective on what areas should be considered part of ""Qingdao."" They distinguish between different administrative and spatial understandings of the city, emphasizing that their perception of ""local Qingdao"" is not based on official boundaries but on a habitual or emotional sense of spatial belonging. They draw a clear line between areas they consider part of the core ""Qingdao"" and those they do not, such as Pingdu and Laixi, which they feel are too far and lack a shared sense of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author defines what counts as ""Qingdao"" based on their own habitual spatial understanding and emotional map (e.g., “城阳即墨胶州西海岸都可以说是青岛” vs. “平度莱西确实是有点太远了”).  
- They draw a distinction between areas they feel are part of the core ""Qingdao"" (e.g., the southern part of Chengyang, the four urban districts) and those they do not (e.g., Hongdao and Huangdao).  
- They imply that the concept of ""Qingdao"" is not fixed and depends on the perspective taken—administrative vs. habitual/spatial.  
- The author explicitly states a lack of ""shared identity"" with people in areas like Pingdu and Laixi.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a habitual or socially shared spatial understanding to define who is ""local"" and what areas are considered part of the core ""Qingdao."" This is not based on administrative or legal definitions but on a culturally sedimented and emotionally mapped sense of where the ""true"" Qingdao lies. The author's spatial demarcation is central to their definition of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that ""local Qingdao"" is defined by a habitual or socially accepted spatial understanding, not by administrative boundaries. This is the core logic they use to distinguish between ""real locals"" and those who are ""technically"" in Qingdao but not part of the core identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author explicitly proposes and defends a habitual, culturally sedimented spatial understanding of what constitutes ""Qingdao,"" and uses this to define who belongs to the local identity.

Output: RL1"
完蛋，我们都是郊区人,RL1,"  
The author expresses a shared identity with others as ""suburban people,"" implying that being from the suburbs is a key factor in defining a common group identity. This statement suggests a self-identification based on spatial location.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""We are all suburban people"" points to a shared spatial identity.
- The term ""suburban"" implies a contrast with urban or core city areas.
- The phrase ""we are all"" suggests a sense of belonging and shared experience based on geographic location.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the shared spatial identity of being ""suburban"" as a defining criterion for group belonging. This reflects a collective understanding of ""local"" or ""non-core"" identity based on geography.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the spatial identity of being ""suburban"" as a shared and defining characteristic of the group, which is relevant to how local identity is understood in contrast to urban centers.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This statement reflects a shared understanding of a specific spatial identity, aligning with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it implies a social perception of what constitutes the ""local"" or ""non-local"" area based on geographic location and group identity.

何止交通？医疗教育购物等等,RL5,"  
The author is continuing a prior discussion (implied by ""何止交通？"" — ""It's not just transportation?"") about the quality of a living environment, now expanding the argument to include healthcare, education, shopping, and other functional aspects of urban life. The author is likely emphasizing that these factors are part of what makes an area desirable and livable, and by implication, part of what constitutes a ""good"" or ""real"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通"" (transportation), ""医疗"" (healthcare), ""教育"" (education), ""购物"" (shopping) are all indicators of **functional livability**.
- The author is likely using these as **standards for evaluating the quality of a local area**, and by extension, the desirability or legitimacy of that area as a ""local"" place to live.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using these functional aspects (transportation, healthcare, education, shopping) to support the idea that certain areas are more livable and thus more representative of a ""real"" or ""desirable"" local environment. This implies that these factors are **used to define what makes an area ""local"" in a positive or desirable sense**, and potentially to distinguish it from less desirable ""local"" areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** functional livability (such as convenient transportation, quality healthcare and education, and good shopping options) as **criteria for evaluating the quality of a local area**, and by implication, for determining who might be considered ""local"" by living in such an area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as it uses the availability and quality of essential urban services and infrastructure as a standard for defining the livability and desirability of a local area, which contributes to the author's view of what constitutes a ""true"" or ""valuable"" local environment.

Output: RL5"
乖乖，住城墙里头的是天龙人吗？讲话都这么吊了，其他都是乡下人哈哈哈,"RL1, RL4","  
The author is mocking or satirizing a group of people who live within the city walls (""城墙里头"") and speak with a sense of superiority (""讲话都这么吊了""). The author implies that only those living within the city walls are considered ""天龙人"" (true locals or elite locals), while others are dismissed as ""乡下人"" (rural or lower-status people). This reflects a clear spatial boundary and a symbolic hierarchy of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住城墙里头的是天龙人吗？"" (Are those who live within the city walls considered 'true locals'?) implies a spatial boundary and symbolic local identity.
- ""讲话都这么吊了"" (They speak so smugly) reflects cultural or linguistic superiority associated with the group within the city walls.
- ""其他都是乡下人"" (Everyone else is just country folks) suggests a symbolic hierarchy where ""city wall residents"" are considered superior locals, and others are outsiders or lower-status locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses spatial location (within the city walls) as a primary marker for defining ""true locals"" and implicitly supports the idea that people living in this area have a higher status or cultural authority. The mocking tone also reinforces the idea that those outside this area are considered ""non-local"" or inferior in the local hierarchy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that spatial location (living within the city walls) and associated cultural behaviors (speaking smugly) are used to define and distinguish ""true locals"" from others, which reflects both spatial authority and cultural-linguistic recognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it uses a historically and socially sedimented spatial boundary (city walls) to define who is a ""true local."" It also partially aligns with **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as it references speech habits and cultural attitudes as markers of local identity. The author's tone suggests they are adopting or mocking a common local belief, but in the context of defining local identity, the spatial boundary remains the core standard.

按以前的行政区块，至少老下关、秦淮区城墙外的部分、雨花、建邺相当于城乡结合部，2000年以前仙林大学城那边还有不少农田的,RL2,"  
The author is discussing how certain areas in Nanjing were historically classified as part of the urban-rural fringe (城乡结合部) under previous administrative divisions. These areas—such as old Xiaoguan, parts of Qinhuai District beyond the city wall, Yuhu, and Jianye—were considered peripheral or semi-rural. Additionally, the author mentions that Xianlin University Town had farmland as late as before 2000, reinforcing the idea that these places were not fully urbanized and therefore not part of the core city in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author references **administrative divisions** as a basis for defining what was historically considered part of the city or its periphery.  
- The text emphasizes **changes over time** in the urbanization of certain areas (e.g., Xianlin had farmland before 2000).  
- The phrase **""城乡结合部"" (urban-rural fringe)** implies a symbolic or administrative boundary between urban and rural areas, which is often used to distinguish who or where is considered ""local"" in a more central or authentic sense.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historical administrative boundaries** and **urbanization status** to define which areas were (or were not) considered part of the core city. This reflects a belief that administrative classification and historical development are key to determining local identity. The reference to farmland and the urban-rural fringe suggests that such areas were not fully integrated into the city's core identity in the past.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of **administrative divisions** and **historical urbanization status** as criteria for determining what constitutes the ""local"" city area and who might be considered part of the core local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** because the author uses **historical administrative boundaries** as a standard for defining what counts as part of the city (or not), which is a key factor in how local identity is constructed and differentiated.

Output: RL2"
以前城墙以内，现在按行政区划。如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了，太小。现在南京全部加一起也不大，再减就没啦,RL2,"  
The author is discussing how the definition of what constitutes the core of Nanjing has changed over time. In the past, the area within the city wall was considered Nanjing proper; now, administrative divisions define the city's boundaries. The author implies that if the old standard were still used, Nanjing would appear very small and even smaller than a county, suggesting that the modern administrative boundary is the legitimate standard for defining the city and its ""local"" scope.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前城墙以内"" (within the city wall in the past) indicates a historical spatial boundary for defining the local area.  
- ""现在按行政区划"" (now based on administrative divisions) introduces the current administrative legitimacy standard.  
- The author contrasts the old and new standards, and implies that the modern administrative boundary is the correct and legitimate one.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explicitly endorsing the use of **administrative legitimacy** as the current standard for defining what counts as Nanjing and its local scope. The historical spatial boundary (city wall) is contrasted and implicitly rejected as outdated and insufficient.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,RL1,"  
The author reflects on their childhood and describes a historical and spatial boundary: ""城墙外"" (outside the city wall) versus ""进城"" (entering the city). This implies a long-standing, culturally sedimented perception of urban space, where the city wall serves as a symbolic and cognitive boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas. The act of going to ""夫子庙"" (Confucius Temple) being described as ""进城了"" (entering the city) reinforces the idea that certain areas are culturally and historically recognized as the core ""local"" city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""城墙外"" (outside the city wall) and ""进城"" (entering the city) indicate a symbolic spatial boundary.  
- ""夫子庙"" (Confucius Temple) is a historically and culturally significant location, used as a marker of the ""core city.""  
- The author's childhood experience implies this boundary is part of a shared or habitual spatial understanding.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the city wall as a spatial marker to distinguish between ""outside"" and ""inside"" the city. This reflects a long-standing, socially habitual understanding of what constitutes the ""local"" area. The reference to ""进城"" (entering the city) suggests that the Confucius Temple area is culturally recognized as the symbolic center of the city, and thus part of the ""local"" identity framework.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of historically and socially sedimented spatial boundaries (like the city wall and core landmarks) to define the ""local"" area and its inhabitants.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the use of historically and culturally sedimented spatial boundaries and landmarks to define the core ""local"" area and the associated identity.

以前交通不发达 所以才觉得城墙内才是主城区 比如过去的白下区的同学就很少去下关区 因为远,RL1,"  
The author reflects on historical perceptions of urban space, noting that in the past, due to poor transportation, people considered only the area within the city wall as the ""main urban area."" They give the example of students from Baixia District rarely going to Xaguang District because it was far. This shows how spatial cognition was shaped by historical habit and perceived urban boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""城墙内才是主城区"" (only the area within the city wall is considered the main urban area) reflects a habitual spatial perception of the city.  
- ""交通不发达"" (poor transportation) is a historical condition influencing this spatial cognition.  
- The contrast between Baixia and Xiguang districts highlights the social habit of distinguishing between ""core"" and ""non-core"" local areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing how people historically perceived and categorized urban areas based on the city wall and transportation limitations. This habitual spatial perception formed the basis for defining who was part of the ""local"" core and who was not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the historical habit of spatial cognition (the city wall as a boundary) as a criterion for defining local identity and distinguishing between core and peripheral areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of historically sedimented spatial perceptions to define ""local"" areas and identities, which aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

确实，小时候我们家住城南现在万象城那边他们都觉得瑞金路解放门好远了，就是城墙城南到城墙城东觉得好远啊那时候交通实在不便利,RL1,"  
The author reflects on childhood experiences of distance perception in the city, noting that areas like Ruijin Road and Jiefang Gate were considered far away in the past, especially due to inconvenient transportation. This implies that the author is referencing how spatial cognition of the city has evolved over time, particularly in relation to how people perceive the ""local"" core versus peripheral areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候我们家住城南现在万象城那边"" (We lived in the southern part of the city where Wanchang Plaza is now) indicates a spatial reference to a specific area.  
- ""他们觉得瑞金路解放门好远了"" (They thought Ruijin Road and Jiefang Gate were very far) reflects a perception of distance between areas.  
- ""城墙城南到城墙城东觉得好远"" (From the southern city wall to the eastern city wall felt very far) suggests a historical spatial boundary perception.  
- ""交通实在不便利"" (Transportation was really inconvenient) provides context for the spatial perception but does not itself define local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing how spatial cognition of the city has changed over time, particularly how certain areas were once considered far from the city core. This reflects a **historically sedimented perception of the city’s spatial structure**, which is part of the **collective understanding of what constitutes the local core**. The mention of old city walls and perceived distances implies a **cultural shorthand for assigning local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **historically and socially accepted spatial boundaries** (like the old city walls) and **perceived distances between areas** are part of the **shared cultural map** that influences how people define what is ""local"" and what is not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a **shared, habitual spatial perception** that influences how people define the local core and its boundaries, even if implicitly.

nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,RL1,"  
The author expresses a sense of being from a ""rural"" or ""outlying"" area (""我们建邺是乡下""), and describes the process of entering the city as requiring crossing a river and a bridge into the city walls, which implies a historical or spatial boundary between the ""local city"" and the ""rural outskirts."" This reflects a perception of spatial hierarchy and a symbolic divide between what counts as ""city"" and what does not, based on long-standing spatial cognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我们建邺是乡下"" (""We Jianye is the countryside"") reflects a habitual spatial perception of where Jianye is located in relation to the ""real"" city.  
- ""进城要过河过桥进城墙的"" (""To enter the city, you have to cross a river, cross a bridge, and enter the city walls"") describes a symbolic and physical boundary between the ""local city"" and the ""outskirts,"" reinforcing the idea that Jianye is not considered part of the core urban area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the idea of crossing a river and bridge to enter the city walls as a metaphorical and literal marker of where the ""real"" city begins, thereby reinforcing the notion that Jianye is not part of the core urban area. This reflects a shared or historically sedimented spatial understanding of what constitutes the ""local city"" and what is considered peripheral.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that spatial boundaries (like rivers, bridges, and city walls) and habitual perceptions of where the city ""truly"" begins are used to define who is ""local"" and what areas are considered part of the city. This is not about administrative boundaries or personal history, but about collective or habitual spatial cognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects a definition of local identity based on shared or historically sedimented spatial cognition and boundary perception, aligning with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

小时候家里人都以城墙为界，城墙外都是郊区,RL1,"  
The author recalls that in childhood, their family and the surrounding community perceived the city wall as a symbolic boundary between the urban core and the periphery (suburbs). This reflects a long-standing, socially shared spatial perception of what constitutes the ""local"" city area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以城墙为界"" (taking the city wall as the boundary) suggests a historically sedimented and socially accepted spatial division.  
- ""城墙外都是郊区"" (outside the city wall is all suburb) indicates a shared perception of what counts as the ""local"" city center versus the periphery.  
- The reference to ""小时候家里人都"" (when I was young, my family all) implies that this was a commonly accepted view within the author’s social and family environment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing a long-standing, socially accepted spatial boundary (the city wall) used to distinguish between the ""local"" urban area and the ""non-local"" or less central suburban area. This spatial perception functions as a cultural shorthand for defining who is or is not part of the ""local"" group, based on where one lives in relation to this boundary.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the city wall as a symbolically significant boundary that has historically and socially defined the core of the local area. This reflects an internalized and accepted standard for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a shared, habitual, and historically sedimented spatial perception used to define the boundaries of ""local"" identity.

跟钱有什么关系？ta说的主城区是历史沿革，优越感来自于底蕴，有底蕴不等于有钱，扯上海人做什么,RL1,"  
The author is challenging the idea that economic wealth or being from a specific city (e.g., Shanghai) is the basis for defining ""local identity."" They emphasize that the ""main urban area"" (主城区) is defined by historical development and cultural depth (底蕴), and that this kind of **historical and cultural legitimacy** is the source of local identity and superiority, not economic status. The author is defending a **non-economic**, **historical/cultural** basis for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""主城区是历史沿革"" (the main urban area is defined by historical development) refers to **historical legitimacy** and **regional categorization**.  
- ""优越感来自于底蕴"" (the sense of superiority comes from cultural depth) ties the legitimacy of ""localness"" to **cultural heritage and historical roots**.  
- ""有底蕴不等于有钱"" (having cultural depth does not mean being wealthy) explicitly **rejects economic wealth** as a criterion for local identity.  
- ""扯上海人做什么"" (why bring up Shanghai people?) implies that the author **rejects the relevance of external regional identity** (e.g., being from Shanghai) in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historical and cultural legitimacy** as the core standard to define what constitutes a ""true local"" area and its residents. This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, where **shared historical and cultural perceptions** of a region are used to establish local identity. The author is also **rejecting** economic wealth and external regional identities (like being from Shanghai) as irrelevant to the definition of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心,RL5,"  
The author expresses a strong positive sentiment toward Xianlin, calling it the ""center of the universe,"" and explicitly mentions ""肯定便利"" (""definitely convenient""), indicating that Xianlin is a desirable and convenient place to live. The phrase ""center of the universe"" is hyperbolic but clearly used to emphasize the centrality and superiority of Xianlin as a local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""肯定便利"" (""definitely convenient"") points to functional livability (amenities, convenience, etc.).
- ""仙林是宇宙的中心"" (""Xianlin is the center of the universe"") implies a symbolic or evaluative superiority of the area, likely tied to its centrality and convenience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the convenience and centrality of Xianlin to define it as a high-quality local area. The emphasis on functional livability (amenities, accessibility, comfort) is the key to the author's implicit judgment of what constitutes a ""real"" or ""desirable"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that a good local area is one that is convenient and central, which is used to define its value and desirability in the context of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's endorsement of functional livability as a standard for defining the quality and desirability of a local area, aligning with RL5.

什么时候方言成为决定是否是主城区的标准了？,N/A,"  
The author is questioning the logic or legitimacy of using dialect as a standard to determine whether a place qualifies as the ""main urban area"" (主城区). This rhetorical question implies that the author is **challenging or rejecting** the idea that dialect should be a defining criterion for urban core status, which in turn affects how local identity is defined.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""方言"" (dialect) is a clear reference to **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4).  
- The phrase ""决定是否是主城区的标准"" (standard for determining whether it is the main urban area) implies an **attempt to define local identity** through dialect.  
- However, the **rhetorical tone** of the question suggests **rejection or skepticism** toward this standard.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing** the use of dialect as a standard for defining the ""main urban area"" or local identity. Instead, they are **critiquing or resisting** it, suggesting that such a standard is arbitrary or outdated. Therefore, while the **topic** touches on RL4 (linguistic-cultural recognition), the **author does not endorse** it as a valid criterion for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not endorsing** the use of dialect as a standard for local identity. They are **explicitly resisting** it. Therefore, **RL4 should not be annotated** in this case.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text mentions dialect, the author does **not endorse** it as a standard for defining local identity. Instead, they are **challenging** the logic of using dialect to define urban core status. Since the **core limitation** of this task is to only annotate criteria **explicitly or strongly endorsed** by the author, **no RL category applies**.

Output:"
行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,RL1,"  
The author is criticizing the use of administrative boundaries to define what constitutes a ""local"" area. They acknowledge that Qixia is administratively considered part of the main urban area, but argue that in practice, local people do not recognize administrative divisions as a valid basis for defining local identity. Instead, they imply that a different, more socially or historically grounded understanding of localness is used.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Administratively, Qixia is part of the main urban area"" refers to administrative legitimacy (RL2).  
- ""But the edge of Qixia reaches Jurong"" implies a contrast between administrative and actual social perceptions of spatial boundaries.  
- ""Can you divide it based on administrative regions?"" is a rhetorical question challenging the legitimacy of administrative boundaries.  
- ""Locals never consider this"" indicates that the author is rejecting administrative legitimacy as a standard for defining local identity, and instead implies that locals use other, more socially rooted criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explicitly rejecting the use of administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they imply that local people rely on other, more socially sedimented or historically rooted understandings of spatial boundaries, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author is emphasizing a shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perception of where the ""real"" local area lies.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author explicitly **rejects** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) as a valid standard.  
- The author **implies** that locals use **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority) as the basis for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text primarily reflects the author's **rejection of administrative legitimacy** and **implicit endorsement of vernacular spatial authority** in defining local identity.

The author is evaluating the spatial structure and image of Nanjing, comparing it to other cities like Hangzhou and Shanghai. The key concern is that the city center remains concentrated in the old city, while the new urban areas (like Jiangbei, Xihexi) are not well-known or attractive to outsiders. The author implies that the lack of recognition and appeal of these new areas affects how the city is perceived and how ""local"" areas are defined in terms of cultural and spatial legitimacy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Core is still the old city"" indicates a traditional center of identity and spatial legitimacy.  
- ""New areas are not well-known to outsiders"" suggests a lack of symbolic or cultural recognition of these areas as ""local.""  
- The comparison to Hangzhou's Qianjiang Century City and Shanghai's Pudong implies that the author believes a well-known, modern area is a marker of a legitimate ""local"" identity or city image.  
- The author contrasts the ""city image"" of old Nanjing (which they say ""has no problem"") with the new areas, implying that only certain areas are considered ""genuinely local"" or representative of the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historically sedimented spatial perception** (old city as core) and **symbolic recognition of new areas** as standards to evaluate what counts as a ""local"" or representative part of the city. The new areas are not seen as part of the ""local"" identity due to lack of recognition and appeal, even though they are geographically part of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **certain areas are not seen as part of the ""local"" identity** due to a lack of cultural or symbolic recognition, and that the **old city remains the legitimate center**. This reflects a spatially sedimented perception of ""localness"" and what constitutes a legitimate ""local"" area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a shared, historically rooted perception of the city's spatial legitimacy, where the old city is seen as the core and new areas lack the symbolic recognition to be considered part of the ""local"" identity.

从大胜关高铁过江这个角度可以看到河西skyline,N/A,"  
The author is describing a scenic or visual perspective from which the skyline of Xihu (河西) can be seen when crossing the river via the Dashengguan high-speed rail. The text is primarily descriptive and focuses on the visual experience or geographical observation, not on defining or evaluating ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of a specific geographical location (Dashengguan, Xihu) and the visual experience of the skyline.  
- No explicit or implicit reference to how people are defined as ""local"" or what criteria are used to judge local identity.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text does not present any criteria, standards, or logic for defining ""local people"" or ""local areas"" in terms of identity. It is a purely descriptive statement about a visual observation from a particular location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There are no elements in this text that the author uses to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The statement does not imply any judgment about who is or is not local, nor does it suggest any symbolic or evaluative logic for local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not meet the criteria for any of the RL categories (no endorsement or implication of identity-defining standards), no RL label applies.

Output:"
高楼大厦就叫城建了？交通,RL5,"  
The author is responding to an implicit or explicit statement that ""tall buildings equal urban construction (城建)."" They challenge this by pointing to **transportation (交通)** as an equally or more important criterion for evaluating urban development. The tone suggests that the author believes **urban infrastructure quality**, especially **transportation**, is a more meaningful or legitimate standard for judging a city's development and, by extension, its status as a ""true"" urban or ""local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""高楼大厦"" (tall buildings) is mentioned as a surface-level indicator of urban development.  
- ""交通"" (transportation) is emphasized as a deeper, more functional indicator of urban quality.  
- The author implies that **transportation infrastructure** is a more legitimate or meaningful standard for defining a developed or ""real"" urban area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **transportation infrastructure** as a **functional livability standard** to judge the quality and legitimacy of an urban area. This implies that the **availability and quality of transportation** are used to define what constitutes a ""real"" or desirable urban area, which in turn informs the author's implicit or explicit criteria for local identity (e.g., who lives in a well-developed, well-connected urban area).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses transportation infrastructure as a key standard** for evaluating the quality of an urban area, which can be linked to how they define or judge what constitutes a ""local"" or desirable place to live. This is not just a personal preference but is framed as a **legitimate standard for urban quality**, which may influence how one evaluates who is or isn't part of the ""local"" urban group.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's focus on **transportation as a key component of urban quality and livability** aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**. The author is using **transportation infrastructure** as a **standard to evaluate the value or legitimacy of a local area**, which can inform how one defines or judges local identity.

哈哈哈有口音哥还行,N/A,"  
The author uses the phrase “哈哈哈有口音哥还行” (which roughly translates to “Haha, guy with an accent is still okay”) to express a relatively positive or tolerant attitude toward someone who has an accent. This suggests that the author is acknowledging the presence of a linguistic or cultural difference (i.e., accent), but not necessarily using it as a strict boundary for defining ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “有口音” (has an accent) relates to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- The tone is lighthearted and not exclusionary, suggesting the author does not strongly enforce accent-based identity boundaries.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author acknowledges the presence of an accent, the phrase does not indicate a clear endorsement of using accents as a standard for defining who is or is not ""local."" The tone is more casual and accepting, not evaluative or exclusionary.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not explicitly or strongly imply that accent is a standard for defining local identity. The text does not go beyond a light-hearted comment on the presence of an accent.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use the presence of an accent as a clear or endorsed standard for defining ""local identity,"" and the text does not reflect a judgment or evaluation based on accent, this does not meet the criteria for RL4.

This reflects a personal lifestyle pattern and spatial habit, but **does not explicitly or strongly imply** that these spatial patterns are used to define who is or is not ""local."" The author is simply describing their own behavior and geographic routine.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of Haidian, Chaoyang, and Fengtai as activity areas.  
- Reference to the 3rd and 4th Ring Roads as commuting routes.  
- Description of a ""home-to-work"" lifestyle.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text is descriptive and does not attempt to define ""local identity"" or evaluate spatial boundaries as symbolic or hierarchical. The author does not suggest that being active in these areas or commuting via these ring roads is a standard for being considered a ""local person"" or for judging the quality of a local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse or imply** any of the RL categories as a standard for defining ""local identity."" The content is about personal lifestyle and routine, not about defining or evaluating local identity.

礼贤拆迁户,"RL3, RL6","  
The phrase ""礼贤拆迁户"" (Lixian relocation households) refers to residents who were displaced due to urban redevelopment in the Lixian area. While the phrase is short and lacks explicit commentary, in the context of defining ""local identity,"" it implies a historical and spatial transformation that may affect how people in the area are perceived or how they perceive themselves in relation to local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Lixian relocation households"" refers to people who were displaced from their original homes due to urban development.  
- This suggests a disruption in long-term settlement patterns, potentially affecting family rootedness or social embeddedness in the area.  
- The term itself may carry a symbolic or evaluative connotation regarding who is considered ""local"" in the changed urban landscape.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The term ""Lixian relocation households"" can be understood as a reference to a group whose local identity may be contested or transformed due to displacement. This may imply that long-term family settlement or social embeddedness is a key standard for defining ""local people,"" and that relocation disrupts this.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The phrase does not express a clear stance on local identity, but in the context of urban redevelopment and displacement, it may imply that family rootedness and continuity in the area are important for local identity. This aligns with the idea that local identity is tied to long-term settlement and social embeddedness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The reference to relocation households implies a disruption in family settlement and social embeddedness, which is a key aspect of RL3 (Family Rootedness) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness). If the author is implicitly suggesting that such displacement affects local identity, then these criteria are relevant.

The author provides a humorous and subjective description of different districts in Beijing, with a focus on **shared cultural perceptions and historical/functional labels** for each area. The tone is informal and personal, but the descriptions rely heavily on **collective cultural knowledge and symbolic labels** associated with each district. The author does not explicitly claim to be from any of these areas, but their descriptions reflect **a commonly accepted or habitual understanding of how these areas are perceived within Beijing**, which is central to defining who is ""local"" or what is ""local"" in the city.

The author’s descriptions are grounded in **collective cultural perceptions and historical sedimentation**, using **symbolic labels and shared knowledge** to distinguish the character of different areas in Beijing. These descriptions serve as **a shorthand for defining the ""localness"" of each district**, based on what is generally understood or accepted by locals. The author is **implicitly endorsing** these **cultural and spatial labels** as markers of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author uses **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented spatial perceptions** to define the character of different areas in Beijing. This aligns with the **RL1** framework, which emphasizes **vernacular spatial authority** and **symbolic regional labels** as criteria for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **strong use of vernacular spatial authority**, where the author draws on **collective cultural understanding and symbolic labels** to describe the character and identity of different districts in Beijing. The descriptions are **not based on administrative boundaries, personal roots, or linguistic differences**, but rather on **socially accepted spatial knowledge and cultural shorthand**.

The author is describing the living conditions in Miyun, particularly its inconvenient transportation system (only buses, no subway), and the resulting difficulty in daily life, such as traveling to a delivery point requiring an hour-long bike ride. This reflects a negative evaluation of the area’s functional livability and implies a contrast with the author’s expectations of what a ""true"" urban or convenient ""local"" area should be.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Functional Livability (RL5):** The author emphasizes the lack of convenient transportation (only buses, no subway), and the difficulty of daily travel (e.g., needing to bike for an hour to access services like a delivery point). These are direct indicators of functional livability and comfort in a residential area.  
- **Implicit Comparison with Urban Areas:** The author contrasts Miyun with what they consider to be a ""real"" Beijing area (which should have a subway), suggesting a standard for what constitutes a desirable or ""true"" local living environment.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the lack of convenient transportation and overall functional livability as a **negative criterion** to evaluate the desirability of the area. While the author does not explicitly say that this means Miyun is not ""local"" or that residents are not ""true locals,"" the implication is that **a place with such inconvenient living conditions does not meet the author’s expectations for a ""real"" or desirable local area**, and thus fails to meet their standard of what a ""local"" environment should be.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **functional livability and transportation convenience are important standards for evaluating the quality or desirability of a local area**, and by extension, what kind of place qualifies as a ""true"" or acceptable ""local"" living environment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author uses the lack of convenient transportation and overall inconvenient living conditions as a **standard for evaluating the quality of the local area**, and implicitly implies that such a place does not meet the author’s expectations for a ""real"" or desirable ""local"" living environment.

The author is listing various districts of Beijing and briefly describing them based on subjective impressions or observations, such as housing prices, educational resources, population composition, and local attractions. However, **none of these descriptions are explicitly or implicitly used by the author as a standard to define who is or is not a ""local person""** or to evaluate the quality or legitimacy of a local area in terms of local identity. The author is simply describing the characteristics of different regions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""房价贵"" (high housing prices) – possibly related to RL6.  
- ""学校多 教育好 鸡娃"" (many schools, good education, intense parenting) – possibly related to RL5.  
- ""潮人多 外地人也多"" (many trendy people, many outsiders) – possibly related to RL1 or RL4.  
- ""好吃的挺多"" (many good restaurants) – possibly related to RL5.  
- ""有个很老的游乐场"" (an old amusement park) – possibly related to RL1.  
- ""好远"" (far away), ""有钱人多"" (many wealthy people), ""北京后花园"" (Beijing's backyard), ""桃子"" (peaches), ""水库"" (reservoir), ""冰灯"" (ice lanterns) – descriptive features of the areas.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not using these features to define or judge local identity**. These are **purely descriptive** and **do not serve as criteria for determining who qualifies as a ""local""** or what constitutes a ""true local area."" The text is a subjective impression or list of observations, not an argument about local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the listed features are used by the author as a standard for defining ""local identity."" The author is **not making a claim about who is or is not local** based on these characteristics.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since **none of the RL criteria are used to define or evaluate local identity**, no RL categories apply.

The author is comparing the **suburbs** and the **city center**, describing them in terms of **environmental quality**, **living pace**, **amenities**, and **transportation convenience**. While the author appears to favor the **suburbs** for their comfort and tranquility, the comparison is used to imply that **certain areas are more desirable or representative of ""local living""** based on these functional and lifestyle attributes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""山好水好"" (beautiful mountains and rivers)** – environmental quality.  
- **""人实在"" (honest, genuine people)** – possibly social embeddedness.  
- **""生活节奏慢"" (slow pace of life)** – lifestyle preference.  
- **""玩的东西少"" (few things to do)** – contrast with city's amenities.  
- **""生活节奏快"" (fast-paced life)** – contrast with suburbs.  
- **""上个班跟竞走一样"" (going to work is like racewalking)** – hyperbolic expression of urban stress.  
- **""有地铁"" (has subways)** – transportation convenience.  
- **""地铁里全是人肉味儿"" (subways are full of the smell of people)** – negative evaluation of urban crowding.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **using functional livability and environmental quality** as criteria to **evaluate the ""value"" of different areas** in the city. The **suburbs** are framed as **desirable for comfort and quality of life**, while the **city center** is described as **overcrowded and stressful**, suggesting that **only areas with certain livability features** (like quietness, natural beauty, and a slower pace) **truly represent a ""local"" or ""ideal"" way of life**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **uses livability and environmental quality** as **standards to evaluate the desirability of areas**, which implicitly informs their **definition of what kind of area is ""truly local"" or ""worth living in""**. This is not just a personal preference but a **value judgment about the quality of local life**, which aligns with the **RL5** framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author **evaluates the suburbs and the city center based on functional livability and environmental quality**, and **uses these to define the desirability of local areas**. This is a clear example of **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**.

The author is describing their personal impressions and experiences of different Beijing districts, focusing on what each district is known for or associated with in terms of cultural, educational, or recreational features. The tone is largely casual and observational, not evaluative or judgmental in terms of defining ""local identity"" in a symbolic or hierarchical way. The author is not using these descriptions to establish a standard for who is or is not a ""local,"" but rather to share subjective associations with each district.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- References to specific districts (e.g., 东城, 西城, 海淀, 朝阳, etc.).
- Some references to cultural identity (e.g., “京爷” in 东城/西城), but in a neutral or even affectionate tone.
- Some references to educational status (e.g., 海淀 students), but not used to judge local identity.
- Some references to personal experience or convenience (e.g., 通州 as 副中心, 延庆 as 远远嘟), but again not as criteria for judging localness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text is a personal, non-judgmental reflection on the author's impressions of various districts. It does not present or endorse a standard for defining who is a ""local"" or which districts are more legitimate in the context of local identity. The references to districts are primarily descriptive and experiential, not evaluative in terms of symbolic or hierarchical local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no clear indication that the author is using these observations to define or evaluate local identity. The text does not express a standard or logic for judging who is or is not a ""local"" based on spatial, administrative, linguistic, or social criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text contains references to districts and cultural terms, it does not present or endorse any RL-based criteria for defining ""local identity."" The author is not using these elements to draw boundaries or establish symbolic hierarchies of localness.

The author lists multiple districts of Beijing and briefly describes each with a set of symbolic, cultural, or functional traits. The descriptions reflect **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented perceptions** of these areas, including their symbolic meanings, cultural associations, and typical functions. These traits are used to distinguish the **identity or character** of each district and implicitly suggest **how they are perceived as part of (or not part of) a ""real"" or ""core"" Beijing**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""皇城根儿 正黄旗""** (Imperial City roots, Zhenghuangqi) – implies historical and cultural centrality, a core area of Beijing.

- **""发大水""** (floods) – negative functional perception of Mentougou.  
- **""不熟 有桃儿""** (not familiar, has peaches) – limited functional and agricultural labeling of Pinggu.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **symbolic meanings, historical labels, and generally accepted social views** of each district to define their **cultural and spatial identity**. These descriptions are **not based on administrative boundaries**, but on **collective emotional maps** and **habitual perceptions**, used to **distinguish between core Beijing and peripheral areas**, or to assign **cultural or functional roles** to different regions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly proposes or implicitly assumes a logic** about **which areas ""count"" as part of the local core or have distinct cultural/functional identities**, based on **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented perceptions**. This is a **clear use of vernacular spatial authority** to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author provides a subjective evaluation of different districts in Beijing, focusing on **housing conditions (老破小, high prices), functionality (shopping, schools), accessibility (distance), and recreational value (tourist traps, barbecue, resorts)**. The tone is informal and evaluative, and the author appears to be comparing the **quality and livability** of these areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Housing conditions and prices** (老破小, 高房价)  
- **Functional livability** (shopping malls in Chaoyang, schools in Haidian)  
- **Accessibility** (好远, 好多宰游客的景点)  
- **Recreational or leisure value** (烧烤, 度假, 风景不错)  
- **Geographical positioning** (e.g., 郊区 for Fengtai)  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **evaluating the livability and desirability** of different districts, especially in terms of **convenience, comfort, and leisure value**. However, **none of the text explicitly or strongly implies that these factors are used to define who is or is not ""local""**, or to judge the **legitimacy of local identity**. The author is not using these features to establish a **standard for who qualifies as a ""local"" person** or to draw identity boundaries. Instead, the text is more about **personal preferences and spatial evaluation**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **No clear criteria for defining ""local people"" identity** are present.  
- The author is **not using housing, location, or function as identity markers**, but rather as **personal preferences or descriptions of areas**.  
- The phrase “好多宰游客的景点” (many tourist traps) reflects a **negative evaluation of a district’s commercialization**, but not as a standard for defining local identity.  
- The author **does not explicitly or implicitly use these features to judge who is a local**, so **no RL criteria are met**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text touches on **functional livability (RL5)** and **geographical positioning (RL1)**, it **does not use these to define or evaluate local identity**. The author is **describing the characteristics of different areas**, not using them as **standards to determine who is or is not a local**. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable**.

Output:"
老师我家怀柔也想要地铁,RL5,"  
The author is expressing a desire for the Huanrou area to have a subway system, indicating that the lack of subway access is a perceived functional disadvantage. This reflects a concern for the area's livability and infrastructure development, which may influence how the area is perceived in terms of its ""local value"" or desirability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Wanting a subway"" reflects a concern for transportation convenience, a key component of functional livability.  
- The implied evaluation is that areas with subways are more convenient and desirable, and that the lack of one may affect the perception of the area's quality or local status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly expressing that access to subway infrastructure is an important factor in defining or improving the quality of a local area. This implies that such infrastructure is associated with a more desirable or ""genuine"" local living environment.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that functional livability (such as subway access) is an important factor in determining the value and desirability of a local area.

The author is listing and commenting on various districts in Beijing, assigning each a brief, often stereotypical or functional label (e.g., ""海淀：很那个的地方"", ""顺义：牛栏山一中"", etc.). The tone is casual and observational, but the key is that the author is **using functional, cultural, or symbolic features** of each district to distinguish or define their character and possibly their status in the local hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Functional Livability (RL5):**  
  - ""海淀：很那个的地方"" (Haidian is a very... place — implying it's a hub of intellectual or academic activity, a key functional area).  
  - ""通州：待富"" (Tongzhou is waiting to become wealthy), ""目前只有环球拿得出手"" (currently only Universal Studios is impressive) — references to current and potential economic or functional value.  
  - ""大兴：荟聚"" (Daxing: Siroco Mall — a commercial/functional landmark).  
- **Social Embeddedness (RL6):**

  - ""昌平：天通苑"" (Changping: Tiantongyuan — a large residential area, implying social density and settlement patterns).  
- **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1):**  
  - ""东城：城里人 / 西城：城里人"" (Dongcheng and Xicheng are ""city people"" — suggesting these are the core, traditional urban areas, with symbolic authority).  
  - ""朝阳：巨大一片 哪都是朝阳"" (Chaoyang is huge, everywhere is Chaoyang — implying a loose or expansive boundary, but still a core area).  
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4):**  
  - ""石景山同学说是城中村"" (Shijingshan students say it's a shantytown — implying a cultural or social identity associated with the area).  
- **Occupational Typification (RL7):**  
  - Not explicitly present, though some districts may be indirectly associated with certain demographics (e.g., Haidian with students/professionals, Shunyi with high school students and their families).  
- **Family Rootedness (RL3) and Administrative Legitimacy (RL2):**  
  - Not directly addressed in this text.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **multiple overlapping criteria** to define or characterize each district in terms of its **status, function, and cultural meaning** within the broader ""local"" identity framework of Beijing. These criteria are used to **distinguish between core and peripheral areas, and to assign symbolic or practical value** to different districts.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **uses and endorses** the following as part of their logic for defining or evaluating ""local"" areas:  
- **Vernacular spatial authority** (e.g., Dongcheng/Xicheng as core ""city people"" areas).  
- **Functional livability** (e.g., Haidian as an intellectual hub, Tongzhou's current and future development potential).  
- **Social embeddedness** (e.g., Tiantongyuan as a large residential community, Shunyi's educational prestige).  
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition** (e.g., Shijingshan as a shantytown in local perception).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **multiple overlapping RL categories** to define and differentiate local areas in Beijing. The author is not just listing facts, but using these features to **construct a symbolic and practical hierarchy of districts**, which in turn informs **how one might define who is ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area**.

The author is listing different districts of Beijing and associating each with specific landmarks, personal experiences, cultural stereotypes, or subjective impressions. While the text is primarily a personal reflection or humorous commentary on various districts, the author implicitly assigns symbolic or evaluative meanings to certain areas, which may imply how they perceive or categorize the ""localness"" of these places or their residents.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1):** The author assigns symbolic or cultural meaning to different districts (e.g., ""东城：故宫 南锣鼓巷"" — Dongcheng is associated with historical landmarks and cultural heritage), which may imply a sense of ""core city"" or ""truly local"" status.  
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4):** ""口音好重"" (heavy accent) in Pinggu implies the author associates regional identity with dialect or speech patterns.  
- **Functional Livability (RL5):** The mention of ""超级合生汇"" (shopping mall), ""机场千万别卡点"" (airport punctuality), and ""体育馆"" (stadium) implies functional and lifestyle-related associations with these areas.  
- **Social Embeddedness (RL6):** The mention of ""别墅 有钱的多"" (villas, many wealthy people) in Shunyi suggests that the author links economic status and property ownership with the identity or value of a district.  
- **Occupational Typification (RL7):** The reference to ""卷毛老太太"" (frizzy-haired old ladies) in Tongzhou implies a stereotype associated with the area, which may serve as a symbolic or occupational-based marker of identity.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not explicitly defining ""local people"" in a formal sense, but rather constructing a subjective map of Beijing districts through cultural, economic, and social markers. These markers function as implicit criteria for how the author perceives the character of each area and its inhabitants, potentially influencing their sense of who is ""local"" in a symbolic or experiential way.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses and uses **vernacular spatial authority (RL1)** and **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** as criteria for defining or distinguishing the character of different areas and their inhabitants. The references to economic status (RL6) and stereotypes (RL7) are also relevant but are more about perception than about defining ""local people"" in a strict identity sense.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is describing various districts in Beijing, assigning them symbolic meanings, cultural stereotypes, and spatial evaluations. These descriptions reflect a **shared or habitual spatial perception** of the city, where certain areas are associated with specific social groups, economic statuses, or developmental stages. The author uses these **symbolic spatial labels** to distinguish between core urban areas and more peripheral or undesirable regions, implicitly defining who might be considered ""local"" and who might not based on where they live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Symbolic spatial labels**: e.g., 东直门, 雍和宫, 朝外SOHO, 中关村, 五道口, 京爷, 四合院, etc., are used to define the character of an area and its associated people.  
- **Spatial hierarchy**: Areas like 东城 and 西城 are implicitly core or prestigious, while 丰台、石景山、门头沟、房山 are described as ""偏"" (remote), ""沧桑"" (run-down), or ""快出北京了"" (nearly out of Beijing), indicating lower status.  
- **Implicit social categorization**: e.g., 朝阳 is associated with ""京爷"" (Beijing-born elites), 四合院 (traditional courtyard housing), and ""繁华都市"" (cosmopolitan city life), suggesting a more ""authentic"" or ""local"" lifestyle.  
- **Functional and developmental status**: e.g., 丰台 is described as where ""外来打工人"" (migrant workers) live in rented housing or dorms, and 石景山 is described as ""不熟悉"" and ""挺偏"" (remote), reinforcing spatial and social boundaries.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **long-standing or widely accepted spatial categories and labels** to define what constitutes a ""core"" or ""genuine"" part of the city versus its periphery. These spatial labels are not just physical but **cultural shorthand** for assigning symbolic value, social status, and identity. The author's descriptions imply a **cultural and social hierarchy** based on where one lives, which is a key aspect of defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and implicitly uses **habitual spatial perceptions and symbolic spatial labels** to define the boundaries and social meanings of different areas. These are used to judge where ""real locals"" live and where outsiders or less desirable groups reside.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects the author's use of **shared, habitual, and culturally sedimented spatial categories** to define the city's core and periphery, and by extension, who might be considered ""local.""

- **Functional livability (RL5):** ""定居"" (settled residence) in Chaoyang, ""空气质量好"" (good air quality) in Changping and Yanqing.
- **Social embeddedness (RL6):** ""学区房"" (school district housing), ""部队人员"" (military personnel), and the social status associated with districts like Chaoyang and Haidian.
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4):** ""口音很重"" (heavy accents) in Fangshan and Miyun.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using a **multi-dimensional framework** to define and differentiate the ""localness"" of Beijing's districts. Each district is evaluated based on a **combination of spatial, administrative, cultural, and social criteria**, which collectively form a symbolic ranking of ""local value"" or ""local authenticity."" The author is not just describing where people live, but **how these places are ranked in terms of local identity, status, and belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
All the identified RL elements are **explicitly endorsed by the author** as part of their personal framework for evaluating the ""localness"" of different areas. There is **no indication of resistance or negation** of these criteria in the text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text contains **multiple RL categories**, each of which the author uses to define or evaluate the ""local identity"" of different Beijing districts. The use of **administrative identity (RL2), spatial symbolic meanings (RL1), family history (RL3), functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), and linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** all contribute to the author’s multi-layered view of what constitutes ""local"" in Beijing.

The author is describing various districts in Beijing, listing key features, stereotypes, or associations for each. These descriptions include geographical characteristics, economic impressions, cultural traits, and symbolic meanings. The text reflects the author's internalized understanding of how different districts are socially or culturally perceived, often with implicit or explicit distinctions between ""urban"" and ""non-urban,"" or ""central"" and ""peripheral"" areas. This indicates the author's use of **shared spatial cognition and symbolic regional labels** to define what counts as ""local"" or ""urban.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical and symbolic labels** for each district (e.g., ""副中心"" for Tongzhou, ""首都机场"" for Shunyi).
- **Cultural and social stereotypes** (e.g., ""海淀：大学很多 那边的父母鸡娃"" — indicating a cultural identity tied to education).
- **Historical and administrative changes** (e.g., ""东城合并"", ""西城合并"").
- **Implicit spatial hierarchy** (e.g., ""朝阳：感觉很有钱的样子"", ""丰台：以前是郊区"", ""昌平：北边太远了"").
- **Functional and environmental characteristics** (e.g., ""通州：环球影城"", ""房山：十渡"", ""密云：水库"").

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **shared social perceptions and symbolic spatial labels** to distinguish between different districts, implicitly defining what is considered ""central,"" ""urban,"" or ""local"" in the broader Beijing context. These distinctions are not based on official administrative boundaries alone but reflect **collective emotional and cultural maps**, which are key to how the author and broader society define local identity in relation to spatial location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly uses shared spatial labels, historical changes, and cultural stereotypes** to define the identity and hierarchy of districts, which strongly implies a **socially conventional spatial cognition** for defining what is ""local"" or not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author's internalization and use of **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories** to define the symbolic and cultural status of different areas, which are central to how ""local identity"" is constructed in this context.

The author recounts an elderly person's definition of what constitutes ""the city"" (城里) in Beijing—specifically the original eight districts (东城、西城、崇文、宣武) as the core city area, while 朝阳、海淀、丰台、石景山 were considered ""near suburbs"" (近郊), and the more distant districts (远郊) were only later incorporated into Beijing. The author then provides historical administrative changes, such as the merging of districts and the inclusion of previously non-Beijing areas (e.g., from Hebei). This reflects the author's awareness and implicit acceptance of a **long-standing, shared regional perception of what constitutes ""the real Beijing""**—a concept that is **not based on current administrative boundaries**, but rather on **historical sedimentation and collective emotional mapping**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author describes how the elderly person distinguishes between ""the city"" (城里) and ""near suburbs"" (近郊) and ""distant suburbs"" (远郊), based on historical settlement and spatial cognition.  
- The author explains the **historical administrative changes**, including the **merging of districts** and the **inclusion of previously non-Beijing areas**.  
- The author notes that the **elderly still refer to the original core districts as ""the city""**, and **exclude the later-added districts** from the same category.  
- The author emphasizes the **collective memory and spatial habits** of how ""Beijing people"" historically perceived the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **shared perception of spatial boundaries** and **historical settlement patterns** to explain how the **""true Beijing""** is defined by the elderly and how this differs from the **administrative expansion** of the city. This implies that **the author accepts or at least acknowledges the legitimacy of this vernacular spatial authority** as a standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not reject** the elderly person's spatial perception but **relays it as a meaningful and widely accepted way of understanding ""Beijing-ness""**. The author also **provides historical administrative changes** to contrast with the **vernacular spatial understanding**, which **reinforces the legitimacy of the vernacular perception** as a cultural shorthand for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author **endorses or at least conveys the legitimacy of a shared, historically sedimented spatial perception** of the city that is **not based on official administrative boundaries**, but on **collective emotional mapping and historical settlement patterns**.

The author is strongly defending the idea that the **historical administrative boundaries and the origin of areas** determine whether a place is a ""true"" part of Beijing. The author argues that **Yanqing** is different from other districts because it was once part of Hebei and only later returned to Beijing, while other districts have always been ""original"" parts of the city. The author believes that this **historical administrative change** is a key criterion for distinguishing ""true locals"" or ""original"" Beijing areas from those that were ""transferred in"" later.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative change and historical belonging**: ""延庆从河北划过来的"" (Yanqing was transferred from Hebei), ""其他区一直是北京固有"" (other districts have always been part of Beijing), ""划到了河北，让河北暂时管理"" (transferred to Hebei for temporary management).
- **Reference to historical records**: ""《房山县志》写的清清楚楚"" (the *Fangshan County Annals* clearly state this), ""你去问问你的历史老师"" (ask your history teacher).
- **Emphasis on administrative legitimacy as a standard for defining ""true"" local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical administrative boundaries and the origin of a place** as a **standard to define what counts as a ""true"" part of Beijing**. The argument is that only areas that have always belonged to Beijing are ""real"" local areas, while those that were transferred in later are not. This reflects a belief in **administrative legitimacy** as the basis for defining local identity and spatial belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **administrative history and legitimacy** as the standard for determining whether a district is a ""true"" part of Beijing and, by implication, who qualifies as a ""true local.""

The author is defending the idea that all 16 administrative districts of Beijing are equally important and part of the ""real"" Beijing. They challenge the traditional or outdated notion that areas outside the Third Ring Road are not ""real"" Beijing, emphasizing that even the Sixth Ring Road area is now well-developed. The author explicitly rejects the idea that only the inner city or core areas define ""Beijing people"" or ""Beijing identity,"" and instead asserts that **administrative legitimacy** (i.e., all districts being part of Beijing) is the proper standard.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""北京16个区，一个区也不能少"" (All 16 districts of Beijing are equally part of Beijing) – this is a direct appeal to **administrative legitimacy**.  
- ""如果你说三环外是农地，我告诉你，那是上世纪"" (If you say outside the Third Ring Road is farmland, that was the last century) – this challenges outdated **vernacular spatial authority** views.  
- ""我在六环里，现在六环建设也不差啊"" (I live in the Sixth Ring, and it's well-developed now) – this is background information about livability but not directly used as a **definition of local identity**.  
- ""北京指的是，城六区: 东西海朝石丰，6个，一个也不能少，郊区，10个，一个也不能少！"" (Beijing refers to the six urban districts and ten suburban districts, none can be excluded) – again, this is a **defensive stance** on **administrative legitimacy**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that only certain areas (e.g., within the Third Ring Road) define ""Beijing identity"" or ""Beijing people,"" which aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority). However, the **core argument** is that **all 16 administrative districts** should be considered part of ""Beijing,"" which is a **clear appeal to administrative legitimacy**. The author uses this as the **standard for defining who is a ""Beijing person"" or what constitutes ""Beijing.""**

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **strongly endorses** the **administrative legitimacy** of all 16 districts as part of the ""real"" Beijing.  
- The author **challenges** the **vernacular spatial authority** view (i.e., the idea that only inner areas are ""real"" Beijing), but this is **not endorsed** by the author.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects a **definition of local identity based on administrative legitimacy**, aligning with **RL2**. The author uses **official administrative boundaries** to argue for the **legitimacy of all districts** in defining who is a ""Beijing person"" and what constitutes the city.

The author is correcting a historical misunderstanding about the administrative and geographical evolution of Beijing. They emphasize that modern Beijing did not originate from the Jin Dynasty’s capital, but rather from the Ming and Qing dynasties. The author also explains that the modern Beijing administrative area was gradually formed after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and that the boundaries of Beijing have changed significantly over time, especially during the Republic of China period and after 1958. The author clearly rejects the idea of identifying with or using the Jin Dynasty’s Beijing as a basis for defining the modern Beijing area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""金国北京和现在北京没用一点关系"" — explicitly rejects the relevance of the Jin Dynasty’s capital to modern Beijing.
- ""现在北京始于明代"" — asserts that the modern Beijing identity and administrative structure originated in the Ming dynasty.
- ""民国十六年（1928）由于首都早迁往南京。北京慢慢就被肢解划给河北了"" — highlights how administrative divisions changed over time, and how Beijing’s boundaries were altered, especially during the Republic of China period.
- ""直到建国才又直辖之后又陆续往回划所辖区域直到1958年才形成今天的北京"" — emphasizes the modern administrative formation of Beijing as a result of post-1949 political decisions, not historical continuity.
- ""明清顺天府（北京）其余地方还在河北手里"" — shows awareness of the historical administrative division and current jurisdictional boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as a central criterion to define what constitutes the ""true"" or modern Beijing. They reject historical continuity with the Jin Dynasty and instead emphasize the **legal and administrative evolution** of Beijing as a political entity that began in the Ming dynasty and was re-established as a direct-controlled municipality after 1949. The author is constructing a narrative that only the **administratively recognized Beijing** (as defined by the state) can be considered ""Beijing"" in the modern sense, not any historical capital.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining what constitutes the ""real"" Beijing, rejecting alternative historical or cultural definitions. The author is not merely describing historical facts, but using them to **justify the modern administrative boundary** as the legitimate and only valid standard for defining ""Beijing"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a strong emphasis on **administrative legitimacy** (RL2), where the author explicitly defines the boundaries and legitimacy of ""Beijing"" identity based on **official administrative history and current jurisdictional status**, not historical continuity or cultural tradition.

The author, born in 1982, describes how people of their generation perceived the spatial boundaries and social hierarchy of Beijing during their childhood. They distinguish between core urban areas (""东西城 is 北京城""), less prestigious inner-city areas (""崇文宣武 is 破落户""), near suburbs (""朝海丰""), and distant suburbs or county-level areas. The author also clearly marks the symbolic boundary between urban and rural as the **Second Ring Road**, with the **Third Ring Road** representing undeveloped land. This reflects a deeply rooted and historically sedimented perception of the city's spatial structure and how it defines local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""东西城 is 北京城"" – Indicates the core urban area.
- ""崇文宣武 is 破落户"" – Reflects a lower status or degraded part of the city.
- ""朝海丰 is 近郊"" – Near suburbs.
- ""二环是城乡分界线"" – The Second Ring Road as the symbolic urban-rural boundary.
- ""三环就是荒地了"" – The Third Ring Road as undeveloped land.
- These all reflect a **shared and historically sedimented spatial perception** of the city and its hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing a **long-standing social and spatial understanding** of Beijing, which is used to define what counts as ""Beijing"" or ""local"" in the city. This includes not just geographic boundaries but also symbolic and evaluative distinctions between different areas. These distinctions help determine who is considered ""local"" and where the boundaries of ""localness"" lie.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** and **implicitly assumes** the logic of shared, historically sedimented spatial categories and their symbolic meanings in defining what is ""local"" and what is not. These include the hierarchy of areas and the symbolic boundary of the Second Ring Road.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text is a classic example of **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, where the author uses a **socially accepted and historically sedimented spatial understanding** to define the boundaries and hierarchy of the city, which in turn informs the perception of who is ""local"" and what constitutes the ""real"" city.

The author reflects on how, in their childhood, going to Tiananmen in Dongcheng or Xicheng was considered ""entering the city"" (北京城), while going beyond that was seen as going to the ""suburbs."" The author contrasts this with the current, more developed urban reality and humorously notes that this historical perception may be why foreigners still associate China with rural areas. The author implicitly acknowledges a long-standing **regional boundary perception** that distinguishes core urban areas from non-core ones, which is used to define who is ""local"" in a spatial sense.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""去东西城天安门叫进北京城"" (Going to Tiananmen in Dongcheng/Xicheng is called ""entering Beijing"") implies a **historically sedimented spatial boundary** for the core city.
- ""出去了就都叫郊区"" (Going beyond is called the suburbs) reinforces the **regional categorization** and **cognitive boundary** between the city center and its periphery.
- The contrast between past and present urban development suggests a **changing social perception of urban space**, but the author still references the old boundary as a point of cultural comparison.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **historically sedimented spatial boundary** (e.g., ""entering Beijing"" = Dongcheng/Xicheng) to reflect on how the city has expanded. This kind of **regional categorization** is used to define what counts as ""the city"" and what counts as ""suburban,"" which is a core aspect of **local identity** as defined by spatial perception and cultural habit.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly references and implicitly endorses** the **historically sedimented spatial boundary** as a **standard for defining what is ""the city"" and who is ""local""**. The contrast with current development is background, but the core argument is about how such spatial perceptions have historically shaped local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL1** category, as it uses **socially habitual spatial cognition** (e.g., ""entering Beijing"" = core area) to define the boundary of the local area and the identity of local people.

门头沟挺好的本地人占大部份 生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多 就是逛街啥的不太行小时候总觉得城里方便 年纪越大越不爱回东边了,RL5,"  
The author reflects positively on Mentougou, emphasizing that it is a place where ""local people"" make up the majority, and that the area is comfortable to live in due to its good environment and low population density. They contrast this with the city center, which they previously associated with convenience but now find less appealing as they age. This implies a preference for Mentougou as a ""genuine local"" living environment based on its quality of life and perceived local character.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地人占大部份"" (Locals make up the majority) implies a sense of local identity rooted in the area.  
- ""生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多"" (Life is pleasant, environment is good, not many people) reflects on the functional livability of the area.  
- ""小时候总觉得城里方便 年纪越大越不爱回东边了"" (As a child, I thought the city center was convenient, but the older I get, the less I want to go back east) contrasts the perceived comfort of Mentougou with the city center, implying a shift in preference for ""local"" living based on quality of life.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the functional livability of Mentougou (environment, population density, comfort) as a standard for evaluating what constitutes a desirable ""local"" living area. The contrast with the city center reinforces the idea that Mentougou, with its local character and comfort, is a better place to live, thus aligning with the author's criteria for defining a ""local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that functional livability (environment, comfort, and population density) is a key factor in defining a desirable ""local"" area, which supports the notion of who is or isn't a ""local"" based on where they live and the quality of life they experience.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5**, as the author uses the functional livability of the area (environment, comfort, and population density) as a standard to define and evaluate the quality of a ""local"" area, which in turn influences the perception of who belongs to the local community.

The author is emphasizing that the perception of ""going to Beijing"" is not a lack of identity, but rather rooted in historical and cultural habit. They argue that the idea of ""Beijing"" is not defined by administrative boundaries or recent incorporations (e.g., from Hebei), but by a long-standing, culturally sedimented understanding of what constitutes the ""core"" of the city—areas historically known as ""Beijing City"" or ""cities with walls."" The author implies that the social consensus around what counts as ""Beijing"" is based on historical spatial cognition and linguistic habits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author emphasizes the historical and cultural meaning of ""Beijing"" as a city with walls and a long-standing political/cultural center (""京兆地区"", ""天子脚下"", ""长城内的人"").
- The author contrasts ""Beijing"" with ""密云县城"" (Miyun county town), suggesting that the former is understood as the core city, while the latter is a peripheral county.
- The author notes that the phrase ""去密云城"" sounds awkward in the Beijing linguistic system, indicating a cultural and linguistic boundary between the core city and its periphery.
- The author explicitly rejects the idea that administrative incorporation (e.g., from Hebei) defines local identity, instead relying on historical spatial cognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **historically sedimented spatial cognition** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** as the basis for defining what counts as ""Beijing"" and, by implication, who is considered a ""Beijing person."" The argument is that ""Beijing"" is not just an administrative entity but a culturally and historically rooted concept, and that linguistic habits reflect and reinforce this understanding.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **historical spatial cognition** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** are the criteria for defining what is considered ""Beijing"" and by extension, who belongs to the local identity of Beijing. They reject administrative definitions in favor of these more traditional, culturally embedded standards.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author uses historical and culturally sedimented spatial understanding to define what counts as ""Beijing"" and implicitly who is a ""Beijing person."" Additionally, the author emphasizes **linguistic-cultural recognition** (e.g., how certain phrases sound awkward), aligning with **RL4**.

The author is mocking the idea that Fangshan’s most notable ""product"" is not its famous persimmons, but rather **commuters from other districts who live there**. This implies a **negative evaluation of Fangshan as a residential area** for non-core urban residents, particularly as a **transit zone or dormitory for people working in the city center**. The author is using this observation to **imply that Fangshan is not a ""real"" local area** in the sense of being a desirable or authentic part of the city, and that its residents are **outsiders or commuters**, not ""true locals.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""房山最大的特产是跨区打工人"" — This metaphorically frames **residents of Fangshan as non-locals or outsiders**, implying they are **not part of the core urban identity**.  
- The **mocking tone** and **labeling of residents as commuters** suggests a **hierarchical or symbolic distinction** between ""real locals"" and those who merely live in the area for convenience.  
- The **functional role of the area** (as a dormitory for commuters) is used to **define its status as a ""non-local"" or peripheral area**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **occupational and residential characteristics** of Fangshan to **define its status as a ""non-local"" area**, with its residents being **outsiders or commuters** rather than ""real locals."" This **constructs a symbolic hierarchy** between core urban areas and peripheral ones, and **uses the function of the area and the identity of its residents** as a standard to **exclude it from the ""local"" category**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **the function of an area (as a dormitory for commuters)** and the **occupational or residential identity of its residents** (as non-core urban residents) are **criteria for judging whether it is a ""real"" local area or not**. This reflects a **symbolic evaluation of local identity** based on **residential function and social status**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL7 (Occupational Typification)**, as it **uses the occupational and residential status of the area's residents** (i.e., being commuters from other districts) to **define the area as ""non-local""** and **construct a symbolic distinction between ""true locals"" and others**.

The author describes their residential area as being just outside the Northwest Second Ring Road, emphasizing its quietness and lack of people in the evenings. They contrast this with more commercial areas like Xizhimen, Jinrong Street, Xidan, Wangfujing, and Jinqiaobei Street, which are more convenient for dining and shopping. The author also mentions that their aunt lives in Chongwumen and that they previously worked in Wangjing, which is less commercial and lacks stores and entertainment options due to recent regulatory closures. The author’s husband even approves of the quiet environment. This suggests that the author is evaluating the quality of different areas based on **functional livability** and **amenities**, and that these factors influence their perception of what constitutes a desirable or ""local"" living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""我住西北二环外几百米""** (I live just outside the Northwest Second Ring Road) – geographic positioning.  
- **""晚上七点除了几个遛弯儿的基本就没什么人了，倍儿安静""** (At 7 PM, only a few people are out for a walk, it's very quiet) – environmental quality and livability.  
- **""吃饭要不西直门，要不金融街西单，远点儿王府井金宝街""** (For meals, either Xizhimen or Jinrong Street/Xidan, or further out to Wangfujing or Jinqiaobei Street) – functional livability and access to amenities.  
- **""我姨住崇文门，我以前在望京上班儿，确实不如那边儿店多""** (My aunt lives in Chongwumen, and I used to work in Wangjing, which indeed has fewer stores) – comparison of areas in terms of commercial and functional livability.  
- **""周围的批发市场全关了，不合规的小店全关了""** (All the surrounding wholesale markets and non-compliant small shops have closed) – impact of regulation on local environment and commercial viability.  
- **""基本生活没问题，购物和娱乐活动欠缺""** (Basic living is fine, but shopping and entertainment are lacking) – evaluation of the area's livability and comfort.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **functional livability** as a key criterion to evaluate the desirability of different areas. They contrast their quiet but underdeveloped residential area with more vibrant commercial zones, and express a preference for convenience in shopping, dining, and entertainment. This reflects a **standard of local quality** based on the availability of services and infrastructure, and implies that these factors define what a ""good"" or ""desirable"" local area should be.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly uses **functional livability** as a standard for evaluating local areas. While they do not explicitly define ""local identity"" in terms of who is or isn't a local, they **do use this criterion to judge the quality of different local areas and implicitly suggest what makes a good or bad local living environment**. This is central to the RL5 framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects the author's use of **functional livability and environmental quality** as a standard for evaluating the desirability of local areas. This aligns with **RL5**, which is concerned with material infrastructure, access to services, and the overall comfort of the living environment as a proxy for defining or evaluating local areas in relation to identity.

你公公纯老北京的话他们的意识里二环内才是北京三环就是郊区了,RL1,"  
The author is describing how a ""pure old Beijing person"" (the husband's father) perceives the city's spatial boundaries. According to this perception, the area within the Second Ring Road is considered the true core of Beijing, while the Third Ring Road is already seen as the suburbs. This reflects a deeply rooted, socially conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" city and where the boundary of ""local"" identity lies.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""纯老北京"" (pure old Beijing person) implies a generational and historical rootedness in the city.  
- ""二环内才是北京"" (only within the Second Ring Road is considered Beijing) and ""三环就是郊区了"" (the Third Ring is already the suburbs) indicate a spatial boundary used to define ""local"" identity and the core city.  
- These statements reflect a shared or habitual perception of the city's spatial structure and its relation to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is conveying the spatial perception of a ""true local"" (老北京), using the Second and Third Ring Roads as symbolic markers to distinguish between the core city and its periphery. This spatial cognition is part of the cultural shorthand used to define who is considered a ""real"" local and what areas are part of the ""real"" city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly opposing this view but is describing it as the mindset of a ""pure old Beijing person,"" implying that this is a conventional and accepted way of thinking among locals. The author implicitly supports the idea that such spatial boundaries are meaningful in defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perception of the city's spatial boundaries, which is used to define who is considered a ""true local"" and what areas belong to the local identity framework.

The author reflects on their evolving emotional attachment to Beijing over five or six years, shifting from dislike to acceptance and finally to affection. The narrative centers on a recent experience where their father, who has physical disabilities, was assisted by Beijing's elderly population while using public transportation. The author emphasizes the kindness and social awareness of the older generation and contrasts it with the perceived indifference of younger people, especially in the context of urban life.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author discusses their **long-term stay in Beijing**, which may imply a sense of rootedness or integration.
- The **father’s disability and the author's financial constraints** highlight the **economic and social conditions** of their life in Beijing.
- The **author's emotional response to the behavior of Beijing locals (especially the elderly)** implies **a cultural or social standard for what constitutes ""localness""**.
- The **contrast between the elderly and younger generations** may reflect **social embeddedness and cultural norms** in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **personal experience with local people's behavior (especially the elderly)** to express a **positive emotional connection to Beijing**. The **assistance given by ""Beijing elders"" is treated as a marker of local identity**, indicating a **socially embedded, culturally rooted behavior** that distinguishes ""real locals"" from outsiders. The **author implicitly accepts this behavior as a sign of local authenticity and community spirit**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses the idea that ""local people"" are those who exhibit certain social behaviors and embeddedness**, particularly in the form of **elderly locals who demonstrate kindness and social awareness**. This reflects a **social embeddedness** standard, where **local identity is tied to community values and social integration**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as the author uses **local social behavior (especially among the elderly)** and **community-based values** to define and affirm who are ""true locals"". The **author's emotional response to this behavior and its contrast with younger people** further emphasizes the **importance of social roots and cultural integration** in defining local identity.

北京地铁对坐轮椅的、盲人全程服务特别好,N/A,"  
The author is describing the excellent service provided by the Beijing Metro to wheelchair users and blind passengers. The statement is a positive evaluation of public infrastructure and accessibility.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The text mentions the ""Beijing Metro"" and specific accessibility services.  
- It discusses ""wheelchair users"" and ""blind passengers,"" which could be interpreted as occupational or social categories in some contexts.  
- The focus is on the quality of service and infrastructure, not on how these factors are used to define or exclude certain people from being considered ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not using the presence or absence of such services as a standard to define who is or is not a ""local person."" The statement is a general observation about public transportation quality and does not imply a hierarchy or boundary of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not endorsing or using any of the RL criteria (e.g., administrative legitimacy, linguistic recognition, etc.) to define ""local identity."" The text is not about identity boundaries or criteria for local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not concern the author's criteria for defining ""local identity,"" and does not imply such a standard, no RL category is applicable.

The author reflects on a shift in living preferences and identity perception. After working in Chaoyang for many years, they now prefer living in Xicheng, where they grew up. They describe the convenience, quietness, and quality of life in Xicheng—such as access to parks, hospitals, and the absence of traffic congestion—and express a newfound sense of belonging and happiness. The contrast between Chaoyang and Xicheng is used to highlight the value of growing up in a specific area and the comfort it brings in adulthood.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候长大的西城"" (grew up in Xicheng) refers to **individual growth history**, a key element of **RL3**.
- The author's preference for Xicheng is based on **convenience, quality of life, and comfort**, such as access to amenities and a relaxed lifestyle, aligning with **RL5**.
- The author contrasts Xicheng with Chaoyang, implying that Xicheng is a more desirable or ""genuine"" local area for them, based on **environmental and functional livability**.
- The author's emotional attachment to Xicheng and the comfort of returning to their childhood area reflects **long-term rootedness and a sense of belonging**, which is also relevant to **RL3**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their **childhood and growth history in Xicheng** to affirm their **local identity** and emotional connection to the area. Additionally, the **functional livability** of Xicheng (e.g., accessibility, lack of traffic, ease of daily life) is used to justify its superiority over Chaoyang and to define what constitutes a ""desirable"" or ""true"" local living environment for them.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **growing up in an area** (RL3) contributes to a genuine local identity.
- The author **strongly implies** that **livability and convenience** (RL5) are key criteria for what makes a place desirable and, by implication, a ""true"" local living environment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The author emphasizes that they ""grew up in Xicheng,"" which is a clear marker of long-term rootedness and contributes to their sense of local identity.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability / Environment and Convenience)**: The author uses the convenience and comfort of Xicheng—such as access to parks, hospitals, and a relaxed lifestyle—to define it as a more desirable and ""genuine"" local area, contrasting it with the stressful environment of Chaoyang.

西村，44公里？？？？我只是看了地铁时长,RL5,"  
The author is reacting to a statement or claim that ""Xicun is 44 kilometers away,"" expressing disbelief or surprise. They clarify that they only looked at the **subway travel time**, implying that **transportation convenience** is the standard they use to judge or evaluate the **spatial relationship** or **desirability** of the location.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of **subway travel time** as a key factor in evaluating the distance or accessibility of Xicun.  
- The author's focus is on **functional livability**—specifically, **transportation convenience** as a proxy for judging spatial quality or desirability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **uses subway travel time** as the **main criterion** to evaluate the practicality or ""closeness"" of a place, rather than physical distance (e.g., kilometers). This implies that **transportation convenience** is central to their perception of spatial quality and possibly to their **definition of what constitutes a desirable or ""local"" living area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses subway travel time as a key criterion** for judging the practicality or accessibility of a place, which is a **functional livability** standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5**, as it reflects the author’s use of **transportation convenience** (subway time) as a **functional livability** criterion to evaluate the spatial quality or desirability of a location.

我是外地来的牛马感觉都一样，反正天天住城中村挤地铁天天上班挨叼,RL6,"  
The author, identifying as an ""outsider migrant"" (""外地来的牛马""), expresses a sense of shared experience among such migrants. They describe a life of hardship and marginalization, characterized by living in *chengzhongcun* (urban villages), commuting via crowded subways, and enduring a degrading work environment. The tone suggests a critique of the urban hierarchy and an implicit recognition of a migrant identity that is excluded from the ""local"" mainstream.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地来的牛马"" (outsider migrant) implies a contrast between ""local"" and ""non-local"" identities.
- ""住城中村"" (living in urban villages) is often associated with lower status or marginal living conditions.
- ""挤地铁"" (crowded subways) and ""上班挨叼"" (being treated poorly at work) reflect a shared experience of economic and social marginalization.
- The author implies that such migrants are not considered ""local"" due to their background and living conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly defines a contrast between ""local people"" and ""outsider migrants"" based on origin, living conditions, and social treatment. The reference to living in *chengzhongcun*, working in low-status jobs, and enduring poor treatment suggests that such factors are seen as markers of being ""non-local"" or excluded from the core ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does not explicitly state the criteria they endorse for defining ""local identity,"" they **implicitly contrast** their own status as an outsider with an assumed local status, using **living conditions and origin** as markers. This aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as the author contrasts their own marginal status (lacking embeddedness in the city through property, stable community ties, or social standing) with an implied ""local"" identity that is more rooted and privileged.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author implicitly uses the **lack of embeddedness in the city** (living in marginal areas, lacking property, enduring poor working conditions) as a marker of being an outsider, contrasting it with an implied ""local"" identity that is more rooted and socially embedded. This aligns with **RL6**.

最大的区别就是西边景色好，空气好，有山有水，不闹腾，宜居。东边各种污染严重，交通拥堵，不宜居。,RL5,"  
The author is contrasting the western and eastern parts of a city (likely a known urban area) in terms of **environmental quality and livability**. The west is described as beautiful, with good air, mountains, water, and a quiet, desirable living environment. The east is portrayed as polluted, congested, and undesirable. The author clearly uses these **functional livability factors** to evaluate which areas are ""genuinely desirable"" or ""truly livable"" local areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Environmental features:** ""景色好"" (beautiful scenery), ""空气好"" (good air), ""有山有水"" (mountains and water), ""不闹腾"" (not noisy).
- **Negative aspects of the east:** ""污染严重"" (serious pollution), ""交通拥堵"" (traffic congestion), ""不宜居"" (not suitable for living).
- The author is **explicitly using these features to define what kind of area is ""genuinely local"" or ""desirable""**, and by implication, what kind of people might be considered ""real locals"" by living in such an area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's evaluation of the western and eastern parts is not just a description of physical differences but serves as a **standard for judging the quality of a local area**. The implication is that only those living in a **""beautiful, quiet, and clean""** area (the west) can be considered to be living in a **""genuinely desirable""** local environment. This is used to distinguish between **""desirable"" local areas** and **less desirable ones**, aligning with the logic of **functional livability**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **environmental quality and livability** are key standards for defining the **value of a local area**, and by extension, who might be considered to live in a **""real"" or ""desirable"" local environment**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5**, as the author is using **functional livability and environmental quality** as the **basis for evaluating the quality and desirability of local areas**, which in turn may be used to inform who is living in a ""genuinely local"" or ""desirable"" local environment.

The author reflects on their lifelong experience of living in the eastern part of the city and rarely visiting the western part. They express unfamiliarity with the west and, upon visiting the northern area for a performance, explicitly judge it as ""more old-fashioned"" than the east. This comparison implies a sense of regional differentiation and symbolic value in how the author perceives different parts of the city. The author also references a local chain store (""仙踪林"") as a marker of the old city center, showing how such cultural and spatial cues reinforce their sense of ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从小在东边"" (grew up in the east) suggests long-term spatial settlement and identity rootedness.
- ""很少去西边，对那头特别不熟悉"" (rarely go west, very unfamiliar with it) reflects a spatial boundary and a sense of regional distinction.
- ""明显感觉比东边老派"" (clearly feels more old-fashioned than the east) indicates a symbolic evaluation of the area's character.
- ""路边的连锁店是仙踪林，这牌子我有二十年没见过了"" (a chain store called Xianzonglin, a brand I haven't seen in 20 years) implies a shared cultural memory of the old city center, reinforcing the author's sense of ""local"" history and identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses spatial orientation (""east"", ""west"", ""north"") to distinguish between different parts of the city and implicitly assigns symbolic meaning to these areas (e.g., ""old-fashioned""). The mention of a nostalgic chain store (""仙踪林"") is tied to the author's personal and collective memory of the old city center, which is used to affirm a sense of ""localness"" and contrast it with areas that feel less ""local"" or ""modern."" These spatial distinctions and symbolic evaluations are part of the author’s criteria for defining what is and is not ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that spatial orientation and historical familiarity (e.g., where one grew up, which areas one is familiar with, and which ones feel ""old-fashioned"") are important in defining ""local identity."" The author also implicitly uses shared cultural memory and symbolic references (like the ""仙踪林"" store) to distinguish between ""real"" local areas and others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's emphasis on spatial boundaries and symbolic evaluation of different city areas (e.g., ""east vs. west"", ""old-fashioned"") aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects shared or habitual spatial perceptions used to define local identity. The mention of the old chain store (""仙踪林"") as a symbol of the old city center also reflects a form of **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as it taps into cultural memory and shared local identity markers.

The author is expressing concern about the long commute times and questioning the future development potential of Yanning (延庆) as a residential area for people who work in the city center. The author implies that the lack of convenient transportation (e.g., subway) and the resulting inconvenience of living in Yanning make it less desirable or less ""local"" in terms of functional livability and future development.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""开车都要这么久"" (It takes this long to drive) and ""坐地铁不更远"" (Wouldn't it be even farther by subway) refer to **transportation convenience**, a key component of functional livability.  
- ""经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便"" (Those who work in the city and live in Yanning are inconvenient) implies **evaluation of the area’s suitability for living**, based on accessibility to the city center.  
- ""以后也发展不起来了吗"" (Won’t it also fail to develop in the future?) suggests the author **questions the future viability or ""local value"" of the area**, based on current infrastructure and livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **transportation convenience and infrastructure quality** as criteria to judge whether Yanning is a suitable or desirable local area. The lack of convenient access to the city center is used to infer that the area is not well-integrated into the core urban life, and therefore may not be considered part of the ""local"" living space or may not be developed as such in the future.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **uses transportation convenience and functional livability as a standard** to evaluate whether an area can be considered part of the local urban living space and whether it has future development potential. This is a **key criterion for defining the scope of the ""local"" area** in terms of livability and integration into the city.

The author is emphasizing the inconvenient transportation and long commute time from Yanqing to the city center, and explicitly advises against living in Yanqing if one works in the city. This reflects the author's view that functional livability (transportation convenience) is a key factor in determining a desirable or ""real"" local living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Yanqing has no subway, only long-distance buses"" highlights a lack of convenient transportation infrastructure.  
- ""3 hours at minimum"" to commute implies a significant lifestyle drawback.  
- ""If you work in the city, you must not live in Yanqing"" shows a direct judgment on the suitability of an area for local living, based on functional livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the lack of subway and long commute time as a standard to evaluate the desirability of living in Yanqing, implicitly excluding it from the category of ""real"" or convenient local living areas. This implies a preference for areas with better functional livability.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that functional livability (specifically transportation convenience) is a key criterion for judging whether an area is suitable for local living.

The author discusses their own living situation in Chaoyang and the distribution of their social relationships, and makes a comparative evaluation between Chaoyang and the ""West"" (likely referring to Haidian or the western urban area of Beijing). The author notes that the West is perceived as ""rural"" or ""unrefined,"" but also that it is ""low-key,"" implying a defensive tone. The author also critiques the perception that Chaoyang, though more modern and vibrant, is dominated by private enterprises and is looked down upon by the West. The core argument is about **social embeddedness and symbolic status differences** between areas, and the author implicitly accepts or reflects these symbolic hierarchies.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""社会关系大多在翠微周边"" (Most social connections are around Cuiwei) → reflects **social embeddedness** (RL6).  
- ""西边的确有点土"" (The West is indeed a bit ""rural""/""unrefined"") → implies **symbolic evaluation of areas** based on social perception, potentially tied to **RL1** (if it refers to a habitual regional cognitive boundary), or **RL6** (if it reflects symbolic status differences).  
- ""民营经济主导，总被西边看不起"" (Private enterprise-dominated, often looked down on by the West) → implies **social hierarchy and symbolic value** tied to economic structure and **social embeddedness** (RL6).  
- The overall tone of mutual disdain between areas suggests a **symbolic ranking of local identity** based on social status and embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **social embeddedness** (RL6) as a key factor in defining the symbolic value of Chaoyang and the West. The author also reflects on **social perception and symbolic status differences** between areas, which may imply **RL1** (if the West is considered a core area and Chaoyang is not). However, the primary standard being used is **social embeddedness and symbolic hierarchy**, especially in terms of economic structure and social status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **social embeddedness** (RL6) as a key standard for evaluating the symbolic status of local areas and their residents. The mention of economic structure (private vs. state-owned enterprises) and social perception (""looked down on"") further reinforces this.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the use of **social embeddedness and symbolic status** (RL6) as a standard for evaluating local areas and the people who live in them. The author implicitly accepts the idea that economic structure and social connections determine symbolic status within the local hierarchy.

The author is evaluating different districts in Beijing (Xicheng, Haidian, and Chaoyang) in terms of property value, living environment, and real estate investment potential. They emphasize that **Haidian** has a long-standing family presence (""几代人都在海淀""), which implies a generational and historical rootedness. They also contrast the **investment value** of real estate in Xicheng/Haidian (high) with that of Chaoyang (low), and mention the **quality of housing** and **lifestyle comfort** in Haidian as relatively relaxed (""很松弛"").

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""几代人都在海淀""** (Multiple generations have lived in Haidian) → family historical rootedness (RL3).  
- **""优质房产保值度高""** (High-quality properties have strong appreciation potential) → social embeddedness and economic status (RL6).  
- **""海淀的时尚黑洞""** (Haidian is a fashion black hole) → this is a subjective description of lifestyle or cultural style, not directly tied to defining ""local identity"".  
- **""西城海淀""** (Xicheng and Haidian) as a collective reference → implies a shared regional or cultural identity.  
- **""朝阳很多盘跌的稀碎""** (Chaoyang has many properties that have dropped drastically in value) → economic evaluation of real estate, but not tied to defining ""local identity"" unless linked to the author's standards for who is considered ""local"" (which it is not in this case).  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The reference to **generational settlement in Haidian** is used to establish a sense of **deep-rootedness**, which is a key criterion for defining ""local identity"" in this context.  
- The **real estate value and quality** in Xicheng and Haidian are presented as indicators of **social embeddedness and economic status**, which the author implicitly treats as markers of a stable, desirable local identity.  
- The **comparison with Chaoyang** is more about investment value and housing quality, not about defining who is or is not ""local.""

The author reflects on their personal life experiences, comparing the livability of two districts: Haidian and Wangjing. The author expresses a clear preference for Wangjing due to its modern, convenient, and comfortable lifestyle, while criticizing Haidian for being outdated and inconvenient, except for its educational function. This comparison implies that the author uses **functional livability and environmental quality** as criteria to evaluate the value and suitability of a ""local"" area for living.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical areas:** Haidian and Wangjing are mentioned as distinct living spaces.
- **Functional evaluation of Haidian:** ""真就只能上学"" (only good for studying), ""啥啥都破破的"" (everything is run-down).
- **Functional evaluation of Wangjing:** ""休闲自在啥都有"" (relaxing and convenient with everything available).
- **Personal preference and implied standard:** The author clearly states that Wangjing is more suitable for a modern, comfortable lifestyle, while Haidian is only suitable for educational purposes and not for long-term living.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates Haidian and Wangjing based on their **functional livability** and **environmental quality**, and uses these to distinguish between a place that is suitable for a ""real local"" lifestyle (Wangjing) and one that is not (Haidian). The author’s judgment is not just about personal preference but reflects an implicit standard of what constitutes a desirable or ""genuine"" local living environment.

The author humorously describes the experience of commuting from the eastern part of the city to the western part, using the metaphor of ""feeling like going abroad."" The reference to ""traffic control"" and ""customs queue"" further reinforces this metaphor. The tone suggests that the author perceives a **clear spatial boundary** between different parts of the city, especially between the eastern and western sides. This reflects a **shared, habitual spatial perception** of the city that implicitly defines which areas are considered part of the ""core"" or ""local"" city and which are seen as separate or less integrated.

- ""I live in the Second Eastern Ring, my parents live in the Fourth Eastern Ring, work is in the Fourth Western Ring"" — indicates spatial distribution and the use of **administrative or functional ring road boundaries** as a reference for location.  
- ""I feel like going abroad every day to work"" — uses a metaphor to emphasize **spatial separation and identity difference** between areas.  
- ""Traffic control (customs queue)"" — reinforces the idea of **crossing into a different, regulated space**, further supporting the perception of distinct spatial zones.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the metaphor of ""going abroad"" to express the sense of crossing into a different spatial and possibly social domain when commuting across the city. This reflects a **shared or habitual spatial perception** of the city, where the core or ""local"" area is implicitly defined by proximity or integration with the author’s own living and working space. The metaphor also suggests that **certain areas are not considered part of the same ""local"" space**, reinforcing a **regional identity boundary**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **certain areas are not perceived as part of the same local space**, especially when they are spatially distant and functionally distinct. The metaphor of ""going abroad"" reflects a **habitual and shared spatial perception** of the city, which is used to define the boundaries of what is considered ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects a **habitual spatial perception** of the city and the **symbolic separation between areas**, aligning with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author implicitly uses **spatial boundaries and shared emotional mapping** to define local identity and spatial separation.

Output: RL1"
哈哈哈，东和西真的就像异地一样。开车去东边太难了，但我又不爱坐地铁,N/A,"  
The author humorously expresses that the eastern and western parts of the city feel like different regions (""就像异地一样""), highlighting the perceived spatial and cultural distance between them. The author also mentions the difficulty of driving to the east and a personal preference against taking the subway, which emphasizes a sense of inconvenience or reluctance to cross into these areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""东和西真的就像异地一样"" (East and West really feel like different regions) suggests a perceived boundary or distinction between areas.  
- The author's own behavior (""开车去东边太难了"", ""不爱坐地铁"") reflects a personal spatial attitude but is not clearly used to define who is ""local"" or to establish a standard for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement conveys a subjective perception of spatial separation between the East and West of the city. However, the author does not use this perception to define or judge who qualifies as ""local"" or to establish a standard for local identity. The focus is more on personal experience and inconvenience than on identity criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author implies a sense of spatial separation, there is no explicit or implicit use of this to define who is or is not ""local."" The statement lacks the functional role of being a standard for judging local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects a personal spatial perception but does not meet the threshold for being a standard or logic the author uses to define ""local identity."" Therefore, no RL category is applicable.

内片确实是一坨，房价原来挺低的，房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾,RL5,"  
The author comments on a neighborhood (""内片"") by criticizing its low housing prices and implying that low prices are associated with undesirable elements (""垃圾"" – garbage/lowlifes). This reflects a value judgment about the area's quality and the kind of people or social conditions that are associated with it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""内片"" (Inner area/neighborhood) suggests a spatial reference.  
- ""房价原来挺低的"" (Housing prices used to be low) is a reference to property and economic conditions.  
- ""房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾"" (Low housing prices have a downside, they tend to breed garbage) implies that the author links low housing prices and economic status to the social or moral quality of the area and its residents.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses housing price as a proxy to evaluate the desirability and legitimacy of the area as a ""local"" or high-quality living space. By associating low prices with undesirable social elements, the author implicitly constructs a hierarchy of local areas based on economic and environmental indicators, which are used to define who belongs to a ""better"" or ""genuine"" local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses using housing prices and the associated quality of the living environment as a standard to evaluate the legitimacy or quality of a local area, which in turn informs perceptions of who belongs to the ""local"" group.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5** (Functional Livability and Environmental Quality Cognition), as the author uses housing price and the perceived quality of the living environment to evaluate the value of a local area and implicitly define the boundaries of ""local"" identity or desirability.

不算吧~最早那边是一大片荒地~小时候去石景山游乐园时下了地铁还要走好远才到~边上只有荒地什么都没有~后来慢慢建了小区~,RL1,"  
The author is reflecting on how the area around Shijingshan Amusement Park used to be a wasteland and lacked infrastructure in the past, and only later developed into a residential community. This implies a contrast between the current and past state of the area, and suggests that the author may view the area as having only recently become ""local"" in a meaningful sense.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""最早那边是一大片荒地"" (It used to be a large wasteland): indicates a historical state of the area.  
- ""小时候去石景山游乐园时下了地铁还要走好远才到"" (As a child, when going to Shijingshan Amusement Park, one had to walk far after getting off the subway): describes past inconvenient access.  
- ""边上只有荒地什么都没有"" (There was only wasteland and nothing else): emphasizes the lack of development.  
- ""后来慢慢建了小区"" (Later, residential communities were gradually built): implies a transformation into a settled, inhabited area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **historical development** of the area as a basis for evaluating its status in the local identity system. The contrast between the past (wasteland, inconvenient, no infrastructure) and the present (developed residential area) is used to implicitly judge whether the area ""counts"" as a legitimate or established part of the city, and by extension, who can be considered local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implies that the area was not considered ""local"" in the past due to its underdeveloped state, and only recently became a proper part of the city through urbanization. This reflects a **spatial legitimacy** based on **historical sedimentation and spatial transformation**, which is used to define what constitutes a ""real"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a shared historical perception of the area's development and its gradual integration into the local identity system. The author implicitly uses the **historical transformation** of the area as a standard for judging its legitimacy as a ""local"" area.

你不会说反了吧海淀新区的大马路对着大山，心情一下就开朗了,N/A,"  
The author is expressing a positive emotional reaction to the scenery in the new district of Haidian, specifically mentioning the wide roads and the view of the mountains. The tone is light-hearted and appreciative of the environment. However, the author is not explicitly or implicitly using this description to define who is or is not a ""local person"" or to establish a standard for what constitutes a ""local area"" in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""大马路"" (wide roads) and ""大山"" (mountains) are descriptive features of the environment.
- The emotional reaction ""心情一下就开朗了"" (mood suddenly brightens) indicates a personal preference or aesthetic appreciation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text reflects a subjective appreciation of the scenery and urban design in Haidian's new district. There is no indication that the author is using this to define ""local identity"" or to distinguish between locals and non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no clear or implied standard for defining ""local people"" or ""local areas"" based on this text. The author is not making a claim about identity, boundaries, or criteria for being a local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does not meet the criteria for any RL category, as it is not used to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or the characteristics of a ""local area"" in the context of identity.

The author is a ""native Beijing city dweller"" and expresses an ingrained perception that beyond certain geographical boundaries (such as Dongdaqiao, Guanyuan, Beisanhuan, Natural Museum, Zhongguancun, Fengtai, Tongzhou, Shunyi, and Yanqing), the areas are considered rural or peripheral and not part of the ""true"" city. This is a clear expression of **historically sedimented spatial perception** that defines the core urban area and distinguishes it from non-core or ""non-local"" areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Repeated use of **geographical boundaries** to demarcate what is and is not considered ""city"" or ""rural.""
- The phrase **""土生土长的北京人""** (""born and raised in Beijing"") indicates a **deep-rooted local identity** and is central to the author’s argument.
- The author lists **specific landmarks** (e.g., Dongdaqiao, Guanyuan, Beisanhuan, Natural Museum, Zhongguancun) as symbolic boundaries between urban and rural areas.
- The author uses **historical transportation limitations** (e.g., ""used to call with a 'rural prefix' fee,"" ""had to take a train from Xizhimen to Yanqing"") to reinforce the perception of ruralness and separation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **geographical landmarks and social perception** to define the **urban-rural boundary** in the context of ""local identity."" This reflects a **collective and habitual spatial understanding** that has been sedimented over time, where being a ""true local"" is tied to being born and raised in the **core city**, and areas beyond these boundaries are not considered part of the local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly and strongly endorses the **habitual spatial perception** of the city and its boundaries as a key standard for defining who is a ""true local"" and what constitutes the ""local area.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses **shared, historically sedimented spatial cognition** to define the core local area and distinguish it from peripheral or rural areas, reinforcing the idea of who is a ""true local.""

The author is explaining a traditional Beijing saying, “东富西贵” (Eastern Wealth, Western Nobility), and emphasizes that it refers to the area **within the Second Ring Road**, specifically **inside the Metro Line 2 loop**, which is considered the core of the old city. The author contrasts this with **Chaoyang District**, which was still rural at the time and not included in the traditional definition of the ""real Beijing"" area. This reflects a clear **geographical boundary** and **historical social consensus** about what constitutes the core ""local"" area of Beijing.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环以里"" (within the Second Ring Road) and ""地铁2号线以里"" (within Metro Line 2) define a **specific geographical boundary** for the ""true Beijing"" area.  
- ""老北京话"" (old Beijing saying) and ""老话指的范围内"" (the scope of the old saying) imply **historically sedimented social perception** and **cultural shorthand** for local identity.  
- ""朝阳那时候还农村呢"" (Chaoyang was still rural back then) highlights a **historical shift in area status** and **identity boundary**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historically sedimented spatial perception** and **collective emotional mapping** (i.e., the traditional saying and the associated boundary) to define who or what is considered ""local"" in the Beijing context. This is not based on administrative divisions but on **shared cultural and historical understanding** of the city's core.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the **traditional, socially accepted spatial boundary** as a standard for defining ""local"" identity in Beijing, and **explicitly excludes** Chaoyang from this definition based on its historical rural status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is explaining how older generations in the city lack a strong sense of modern administrative ""districts"" and instead identify with smaller, more specific local places (e.g., street names, neighborhoods, or villages). This reflects a habitual, vernacular understanding of local space that contrasts with formal administrative divisions. The author also notes that this vernacular identification is used only when communicating with outsiders who are unfamiliar with the finer local geography.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific local place names like ""凤山门"" (Fengshan Gate), ""望江门"" (Wangjiang Gate), etc., which are traditional or colloquial local names.
- Reference to older generations’ weak sense of administrative districts.
- The contrast between vernacular local identification (small, familiar places) and formal administrative boundaries.
- The use of local names as a default for self-identification among ""locals.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explaining how local identity is constructed based on **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**. This is not based on official administrative boundaries but on a collective, vernacular understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" place or a ""local person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author reflects on how people from **Lao Yuhang** (老余杭) are often excluded from the identity of being ""true Hangzhou people"" by others in the city. This exclusion is based on **geographical boundaries and social perceptions of urban core vs. periphery**, and is reinforced by **historical or habitual regional cognition**. The author experienced this firsthand when being told by others in Hangzhou that living in the suburbs (like Yuhang) does not qualify one as a ""real Hangzhou person."" The author thus implicitly accepts and internalizes this logic of **geographical legitimacy and cultural belonging** in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""老余杭"" (Lao Yuhang)** as a distinct regional identity, separate from the city center.  
- **""杭州人"" (Hangzhou people)** is contrasted with ""余杭人"" (Yuhang people), implying a distinction between core and peripheral identities.  
- **""乡下人"" (rural people)** is used as a derogatory term by the locals to exclude the author, linking **geographical location** with **cultural legitimacy**.  
- The **historical perception** that people from the suburbs or rural areas are not ""true locals"" is clearly conveyed.  
- The author **internalizes and implicitly accepts** the logic of defining local identity based on **geographical boundaries and cultural belonging**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s experience and reflection demonstrate that **regional identity is socially constructed and tied to a historical perception of urban core vs. periphery**. The author uses this logic to explain why people from Yuhang often avoid identifying as ""Hangzhou people"" and instead refer to themselves as ""Lao Yuhang"" or ""suburban Hangzhou."" This reflects an internalized **social habit of regional cognition** that defines who is considered a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses and reflects** the **socially conventional regional cognition** that distinguishes between ""true Hangzhou people"" (urban core) and ""Lao Yuhang people"" (suburban/rural).

The author, identifying as from Yuhang, explicitly states that people from Yuhang typically refer to going to ""Hangzhou"" (the city) rather than ""the urban district,"" which implies a perceived separation between Yuhang and the core city. The author also emphasizes a lack of belonging and is explicitly excluded by others as ""not one of us,"" which reflects a social and cultural boundary between Yuhang and the central city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author and their community refer to ""going to Hangzhou"" rather than ""the urban district,"" indicating a **shared habitual regional cognition** of where the ""real"" city is.
- The author feels a **lack of belonging** and is **excluded by others**, implying that **socially accepted regional boundaries** are used to define who is considered a ""real"" local.
- The phrase “我们没归属感，人家也不当我们是自己人” (we don't feel a sense of belonging, and others don't consider us as their own) suggests **a socially constructed identity boundary** based on regional categorization.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **habitual regional perception** of what constitutes the ""true"" city (Hangzhou) versus the periphery (Yuhang) to explain why they and their community are excluded from the ""local"" identity. This habitual spatial cognition is used to **define the boundary of local identity** and **justify a sense of exclusion**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

They question the legitimacy of defining ""rural"" identity based on perceived characteristics like farming background or rural location, and argue that many places have long-standing urban populations with urban hukou (户口), urban occupations (e.g., workers, civil servants), and no land ties. The author is explicitly rejecting the idea that such people or places should be considered ""rural"" or ""non-local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

The author expresses frustration and resentment toward being labeled as ""rural"" or ""outsiders"" in Hangzhou despite having lived and studied in Yuhang (a district of Hangzhou) for 12 years. The author emphasizes a long-term settlement history and challenges the idea that Hangzhou's core identity excludes people from its own districts. The author implicitly rejects the notion that only people from the ""old Hangzhou"" (老底子杭州) can be considered truly local, and criticizes the exclusionary logic used by others to define ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""余杭读了12年书"" (studied in Yuhang for 12 years) reflects **long-term settlement history**.
- ""乡下人"" (rural people) is a derogatory label used by others to exclude the author, implying **occupational or social status** differences.
- ""老底子杭州"" (old Hangzhou) is a symbolic reference to a core historical area, reflecting **vernacular spatial authority**.
- The author challenges the idea that Hangzhou is a ""small place"" that ""swallowed"" others to develop, implying a **historical and spatial expansion** that should be recognized in defining local identity.

The author describes a linguistic and cultural phenomenon: once someone correctly identifies a specific area in Hangzhou (e.g., Wulinmen, Caihe, Cuiyuan, Zhaohui), it is assumed that the person is a ""true local,"" and this leads to a shift in communication to Hangzhou dialect—specifically the dialect of the old central city area. The author humorously emphasizes that even a few kilometers apart can lead to noticeable dialect differences, reinforcing the idea that dialect is a key marker of ""localness.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of specific area names (e.g., Wulinmen, Caihe, etc.) implies **regional spatial cognition**.
- The use of **Hangzhou dialect** as a marker for switching into ""local language mode"" implies **linguistic-cultural recognition**.
- The author emphasizes that the dialect of the **old central city** is the standard, and that **dialect differences** across short distances are significant in local identity perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **ability to identify specific local areas** and **speaking the dialect of the old city** as **indicators of local identity**. These are not just casual observations but are framed as **standards** for identifying ""true locals"" and engaging in local communication.

The author mentions that when they went to ""龙翔桥"" (Longxiangqiao, a downtown area of Hangzhou), they would say they were going to ""Hangzhou."" This reveals a **local spatial perception** where certain areas are not seen as the core city and are associated with a different level of ""localness.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""别说其他区了"" (Forget about other districts) and ""我是西湖区三墩的浙大紫金港这边"" (I’m from Sandun, West Lake District, near Zhejiang University’s Zhijin Port campus) establish the author's location.  
- ""小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州"" (When I was a kid, going to Longxiangqiao meant going to Hangzhou) implies a **historical and spatial perception** where Sandun is not seen as part of the core city.  
- ""对外都说自己三墩乡下人"" (I always tell others I’m a Sandun ""countryside"" person) shows the **author’s own use of spatial labels** to define their identity in relation to the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **spatial perception and social labeling** to distinguish between ""true"" Hangzhou and its outskirts. By calling Sandun ""乡下"" (rural) and stating that going to Longxiangqiao is like going to the city, the author is drawing on a **shared cultural and historical understanding** of what constitutes the core city and what is considered peripheral. This reflects a **long-standing spatial cognition** that informs how the author defines their own and others’ local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is addressing a common perception or attitude that people from the central urban area of Hangzhou may look down on those from surrounding areas. However, the author argues that this is not necessarily the case, and that the issue is further complicated by government policies (""做的不地道"") that fail to foster a sense of belonging in many districts. The author emphasizes that when people ask ""where are you from?"", they are really asking about how the person **identifies themselves** in terms of local identity, not just administrative or geographical origin.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Hangzhou urban area looks down on the surrounding areas"" implies **regional cognitive boundaries** and **social perceptions** of local identity.
- ""Many district residents have no sense of belonging to Hangzhou"" reflects **disconnection between administrative identity and personal identification**, potentially related to **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).
- ""Where are you from?"" is interpreted as asking about **self-identification**, not just administrative origin, which could involve **multiple RL dimensions** (e.g., RL1, RL2, RL3).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **critiquing** the idea that administrative or geographical origin alone defines ""local identity,"" and is suggesting that **social perception** (RL1), **government policy influence**, and **personal identification** are more important in how people define themselves as ""local."" The author does **not endorse** the idea that administrative boundaries or regional divisions are the sole or best criteria for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the idea that administrative legitimacy (RL2) or vernacular spatial authority (RL1) are the sole or best criteria for local identity. Instead, the author **challenges** the legitimacy of such criteria and emphasizes **personal identification** and **government failure** in fostering a sense of belonging. Since the author is **not endorsing** any of the RL criteria as defining local identity, but rather **questioning** or **resisting** them, **no RL label should be assigned**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text **does not clearly express any criteria that the author endorses** for defining local identity. Instead, it critiques or questions the legitimacy of administrative, regional, and social-based definitions. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable** under the annotation guidelines.

我西湖区三墩镇，我都说自己杭州乡下人……跟他们城里人讲的话不一样,RL1,"  
The author identifies as a resident of Sanzhen Town in Xihu District, Hangzhou, and self-identifies as a ""rural Hangzhou person"" (""杭州乡下人""), contrasting themselves with ""city people"" (""城里人""). The author also mentions that the way they speak differs from ""city people,"" indicating a linguistic or cultural boundary between the two groups.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""杭州乡下人"" (rural Hangzhou person) implies a self-identification based on perceived rural status within the city.  
- ""城里人"" (city people) is a contrasting group, suggesting a spatial and social hierarchy.  
- ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" (speak differently from city people) indicates linguistic or cultural differences as a distinguishing factor.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a vernacular spatial distinction between ""rural Hangzhou"" and ""urban Hangzhou"" to self-identify and to highlight differences in speech and culture. This reflects a shared social perception of spatial hierarchy and insider/outsider distinctions within the city, which is used to define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts the social perception that certain areas (like Sanzhen Town) are considered ""rural"" within the city and that this spatial identity is associated with linguistic and cultural differences. This is used to define who is considered a ""true"" or ""core"" local (""city people"") and who is not (""rural people"").

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects the author's use of a socially sedimented spatial hierarchy (rural vs. urban within Hangzhou) to define local identity and distinguish between groups based on perceived spatial and cultural differences.

会啊，城里的就不太看得起我们这种乡下的，虽然钱还没我们多，像我们西湖区都是乡下地方，讲的都是老余杭的话，跟他们上城下城都是讲杭州话的，还是有点差别，哈哈哈啊,RL4,"  
The author expresses a sense of difference between urban and rural residents, noting that urban dwellers look down on rural people despite the latter possibly having more money. The author emphasizes linguistic differences—rural areas (like West Lake District) speak ""old Yuhang dialect,"" while urban districts (like Shangcheng and Xicheng) speak ""Hangzhou dialect""—as a key marker of distinction.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""乡下的"" (rural people), ""城里的"" (urban people) are identity markers.  
- ""讲的老余杭话"" (speaking old Yuhang dialect), ""讲杭州话的"" (speaking Hangzhou dialect) are linguistic markers.  
- The author implies that linguistic differences are used to distinguish ""urban"" and ""rural"" identities and that the urban group holds a higher symbolic status.  
- The author also mentions a perceived social hierarchy (urban people look down on rural people).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic differences** as a central criterion for distinguishing between urban and rural identities and implicitly accepts or acknowledges that such differences carry symbolic weight in defining who is ""local"" or ""more local."" The urban identity is portrayed as more ""standard"" or ""legitimate"" in terms of language, while rural identity is marked by dialect and seen as less prestigious.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **linguistic and cultural differences** as a standard for defining and distinguishing between different local identities (urban vs. rural), and this distinction carries social meaning.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as it uses **language and dialect** as markers to distinguish between ""urban"" and ""rural"" local identities and implies a symbolic hierarchy based on linguistic usage.

Output: RL4"
你同学说错了，西湖区也是乡下，因为我们这讲的都是余杭话，其他几个区讲的都是杭州话,RL4,"  
The author corrects their peer's statement and asserts that **Xihu District is also considered ""rural"" or ""non-local""** in their perspective, because **people in their area speak Yuhang dialect**, while **other districts speak Hangzhou dialect**. This implies that **language and dialect** are used as a marker to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas or people.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Xihu District is also considered rural""** suggests a judgment of local status.  
- **""We speak Yuhang dialect""** and **""other districts speak Hangzhou dialect""** are key linguistic markers.  
- The distinction between dialects is used to imply **cultural and linguistic boundaries** between different areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **language/dialect** as a **criterion for evaluating or distinguishing ""local"" identity**, implying that **speaking the ""local"" dialect (Hangzhou) is a sign of being ""truly local""**, while speaking a different dialect (Yuhang) is associated with being ""non-local"" or ""rural.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **linguistic differences (dialect)** as a standard for defining who is or is not part of the ""local"" group, which directly relates to **cultural and linguistic recognition**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL4** category, which is based on **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a boundary marker for ""local identity.""

那你是杭州市区的吧，我是富阳的，以前是独立的市，前几年才划进杭州的,RL2,"  
The author is distinguishing their own identity as coming from **Fuyang**, which was previously an independent city and only recently incorporated into **Hangzhou**. This reflects a clear awareness of **administrative boundary changes** and how such changes affect **local identity**. The speaker implies that the incorporation of Fuyang into Hangzhou does not necessarily make Fuyang residents feel or be considered ""Hangzhou people"" in the traditional sense.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of **""划进杭州"" (incorporated into Hangzhou)** indicates an **administrative boundary change**.  
- The contrast between **""杭州市区"" (Hangzhou urban area)** and **""富阳"" (Fuyang)** highlights **administrative legitimacy** as a standard for defining local identity.  
- The speaker explicitly notes that Fuyang was once an **independent city**, suggesting a historical and administrative distinction that still holds symbolic weight.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The speaker uses the **administrative status** and **historical boundary change** of Fuyang to define their identity as **not fully ""Hangzhou""** despite the recent administrative reclassification. This reflects a **rejection or at least a distinction** of administrative legitimacy as a sole basis for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **acknowledges the administrative change** but **implies that it does not fully redefine local identity**, suggesting that **administrative legitimacy is a factor but not the only or definitive one**. However, since the speaker is using **administrative status (pre- and post-incorporation)** as a **basis for identity differentiation**, it is still relevant under RL2.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text explicitly references **administrative boundary changes and legitimacy** as part of the speaker’s identity narrative. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the speaker is using the **administrative incorporation** as a key point in defining the **difference in local identity**.

你猜怎么着，你划的滨江萧山这边本地人，平时去市区都会说：去杭州玩，还有东边划得都到七堡了，我那边的同学可不认为他是市中心的你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗,RL1,"  
The author is expressing disagreement with how certain administrative or spatial boundaries are drawn (e.g., ""滨江萧山"" and ""七堡"" being included in the definition of the city core). They argue that people from these areas, when traveling to the traditional urban center of Hangzhou, refer to it as ""going to Hangzhou to play,"" which implies they do **not** consider themselves part of the city center. The author is criticizing the boundary-drawing logic as arbitrary or self-serving.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author discusses how **people from certain areas (滨江萧山, 七堡)** behave or speak when going to the city center (e.g., calling it ""going to Hangzhou to play""), which reflects a **shared perception of what constitutes the ""real"" city**.
- The author critiques the **administrative boundary** that includes these areas as part of the city center, but **people there do not identify with it**, indicating a **discrepancy between administrative and vernacular spatial cognition**.
- The phrase ""把自己家先划进去了呗"" (""you're just drawing the boundary to include your own home"") implies **subjective or biased boundary-setting**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **vernacular spatial cognition** to argue that **local identity is not defined by administrative boundaries**, but by **shared perception and self-identification**. The fact that people from these newly incorporated areas still refer to the city center as ""Hangzhou"" shows that **they do not see themselves as part of the ""local"" city center**, despite administrative inclusion. This is the core of the author’s argument.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **strongly endorses** the idea that **vernacular spatial cognition**, not administrative boundaries, should define who is considered ""local."" The author explicitly **resists** the idea of using administrative inclusion to redefine local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **shared, habitual spatial perception and identity differences between areas** to define who is ""local,"" aligning with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,RL3,"  
The author recounts a former colleague who is described as a ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (native Hangzhou person), and highlights that this person is only familiar with three specific roads in Hangzhou—解放路 (Jiefang Road), 凤起路 (Fengqi Road), and 庆春路 (Qingchun Road). The tone implies that this limited familiarity with the city reflects a shallow or localized understanding of the city, potentially suggesting that true ""local identity"" is tied to generational rootedness and a broader, more comprehensive knowledge of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (born and raised in Hangzhou) is a key phrase from RL3 (Family Rootedness), indicating generational settlement and upbringing in the area.  
- The limited knowledge of the city (only three roads) may imply a critique or contrast in the depth of local identity—i.e., being born and raised does not necessarily equate to deep local knowledge or belonging.  
- The reference to three specific roads does not clearly align with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it does not reflect a shared social convention or symbolic boundary of the local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the phrase ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" to emphasize the idea that family rootedness is a core criterion for defining local identity. However, the narrative also subtly questions the depth of that identity by highlighting the limited spatial knowledge of the person in question. The main point remains that generational settlement (RL3) is still the central logic used to define who is a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly uses the concept of being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) to define the person as a ""local,"" even if their knowledge is limited. This shows that the author still endorses the logic of family rootedness (RL3) as a core standard for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text primarily reflects the RL3 standard, which defines local identity based on generational settlement and upbringing in the area.

你都划到萧山了，就把我最顶上的大塘栖也划进去呗，让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验,RL2,"  
The author is humorously requesting that if a certain area (萧山, Xiaoshan) has been officially incorporated into the city proper, then another area (大塘栖, Datangxi), which the author considers to be of similar status or importance, should also be included in the city center or urban area. The author wants to experience what it's like to ""live in the city"" (住在市区), implying that administrative reclassification is a key factor in defining ""local"" or ""urban"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""你都划到萧山了"" refers to the administrative incorporation of Xiaoshan into the urban area.  
- ""让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验"" implies that being incorporated into the city (市区) is a key marker of local identity or urban belonging.  
- The author's request is based on the logic that if one area is considered urban due to administrative change, then another should be too.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **administrative legitimacy** of Xiaoshan's incorporation as a standard to argue that Datangxi should also be considered part of the city. This shows that the author **endorses administrative boundaries and official reclassification** as a key criterion for defining what counts as the ""local"" or ""urban"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses the idea that administrative reclassification (划进)** is a valid and important criterion for defining ""local"" or ""urban"" status. This is a core part of the author's argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author explicitly uses the logic of administrative boundary changes to argue for inclusion in the ""local"" or ""urban"" identity framework.

杭州人至少要说杭州话，萧山话杭州人都听不懂，硬划进杭州市区，别说杭州人了，问问萧山人干吗？,"RL1, RL4","  
The author is criticizing the administrative decision to incorporate Xiaoshan into Hangzhou’s urban core, arguing that this does not align with the social or cultural perception of what constitutes a ""true"" Hangzhou area. The author emphasizes that Xiaoshan people speak a dialect that is unintelligible to most Hangzhou people, and that this linguistic and cultural difference undermines the legitimacy of the administrative boundary change in defining who is a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Hangzhou people at least should speak Hangzhou dialect"" reflects linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""Xiaoshan dialect is unintelligible to Hangzhou people"" reinforces the idea of linguistic-cultural boundaries.  
- ""Hardly incorporated into Hangzhou urban area"" refers to administrative legitimacy (RL2).  
- ""Ask the people of Xiaoshan"" implies the author is questioning the legitimacy of the administrative decision from the perspective of local identity and social consensus (RL1).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4) as a key criterion to define ""local people"" — i.e., being a ""Hangzhou person"" is tied to speaking the Hangzhou dialect. Additionally, the author is **critiquing the administrative boundary change** (RL2) as not reflecting the actual social or cultural reality of local identity. The author also **implies a long-standing social consensus** (RL1) that Xiaoshan is not part of the core Hangzhou identity, despite its administrative inclusion.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4) and **socially conventional regional cognition** (RL1) to define who is a ""true"" local. The author also **resists** the use of **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as a valid criterion for defining local identity, but since the task only focuses on criteria the author **endorses**, **RL2 is excluded**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author is asserting a **socially conventional regional boundary** between Hangzhou and Xiaoshan, and with **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author emphasizes **language** as a key marker of local identity.

 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。

The author discusses the historical and evolving definitions of what constitutes the ""core area"" of Guangzhou, emphasizing that the concept of the ""old Guangzhou"" or ""true Guangzhou"" differs from the modern administrative or tourist-centric understanding. The author highlights that for local Guangzhou residents, the ""true"" Guangzhou is associated with the ""old four districts"" and even more specifically, the old urban center (e.g., the area of the ancient Panyu city, now part of Yuexiu District). This reflects a deep-rooted, historically sedimented understanding of local identity based on spatial perception and historical continuity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author contrasts ""old Guangzhou"" with ""modern Guangzhou,"" emphasizing that the ""old"" or ""true"" Guangzhou is associated with the ""old four districts"" (越秀, 东山, 荔湾, 河南).
- The author explains how the older generation and local residents define the ""core area"" of Guangzhou, which is not the same as the administrative or tourist perception.
- The mention of historical landmarks like the ancient ""Ren Xiao City"" (任嚣城) and their current locations (e.g., around Beijing Road) supports the idea that historical continuity is a key part of the local identity definition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses historical spatial perception and shared cultural understanding to distinguish between the ""true"" or ""authentic"" Guangzhou and the modern, expanded city. This reflects a standard of local identity rooted in historical and spatial sedimentation, where only those familiar with or originating from the ""old Guangzhou"" are considered ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly and implicitly endorses the idea that local identity is tied to historical and spatial continuity—specifically, to the old urban core of Guangzhou and its associated cultural memory. This is a strong example of a vernacular spatial authority used to define who or what is ""truly local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

没错，大致就是东山还没并入的越秀区，还有一些后来并入的比如矿泉街道、桂花岗也不算进去,RL1,"  
The author is discussing the historical and administrative boundaries of the Dongshan area in Guangzhou, specifying that parts of Yuexiu District (before its incorporation) and later-added areas like Kuiquan Street and Guihuagang were not considered part of the ""true"" local area. This reflects a distinction between areas that are seen as part of the ""original"" local identity and those that were later incorporated.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""还没并入的越秀区"" (Yuexiu District that had not yet been incorporated) and ""后来并入的"" (later incorporated areas) refer to administrative boundary changes.  
- The author emphasizes that these later-added areas are **not** considered part of the original local area, indicating a preference for historical or pre-incorporation boundaries in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the historical administrative status and the process of incorporation to draw a boundary between ""true"" local areas and those that are newly included. This implies that the author values the pre-incorporation status of a region as a key factor in defining what counts as ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is describing their childhood background and language habits, emphasizing that they grew up in rural areas of Henan and spoke with a local dialect of Panyu and Shunde. The phrase ""乡下仔来的"" (""came from the countryside"") further reinforces their self-identification with rural origins. This suggests that the author is acknowledging or reflecting on their identity as someone with a rural background, possibly in contrast to urban or ""local"" city dwellers.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""满口番禺顺德乡下口音"" (speaking with a rural Panyu/顺德 accent) relates to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- ""乡下仔来的"" (came from the countryside) indicates a **self-identification with rural origins**, potentially in contrast to urban ""local"" identities.  
- The use of ""乡下"" (rural) and the dialect implies **a distinction between rural and urban ""local"" identities**, with the rural identity being perceived as different or less central.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **language and self-identification with rural origins** as markers of their background, which may be implicitly contrasted with urban ""local"" identities. The mention of a **local dialect and rural upbringing** is not just descriptive but may serve as a way to **acknowledge or explain a sense of identity difference**—possibly in relation to who is considered a ""true local.""

The author is discussing a friend's family situation in which a family member from Taishan (an outlying area) moved to Dashi at a young age and later gained **dividend rights** (分红). The author is curious about how this family managed to obtain such rights, implying that **dividend rights** are a significant resource or privilege associated with local status or community-based belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""十几岁才入户大石那边"" (moved to Dashi at a young age and registered their hukou there) suggests an individual's settlement history and integration into the area.  
- ""有分红"" (has dividend rights) is a direct reference to **community-based economic benefits**, which are often tied to local identity, especially in rural or suburban collectives where property or land rights are shared.  
- The author’s **curiosity** about how this family obtained such rights implies that **dividend rights are not easily accessible to outsiders or new residents**, and are likely reserved for those with deeper **local roots or social embeddedness**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting the **importance of dividend rights** as a **symbolic and material benefit** that is typically reserved for those who are **deeply embedded in the local community**, whether through long-term residence, family ties, or administrative registration. The fact that the author is surprised by the situation suggests that **dividend rights are seen as a marker of ""true"" local status**, and that this status is not easily transferred or obtained by outsiders or recent migrants.

The author **implicitly endorses the idea that access to community-based economic benefits (like dividends)** is a **criterion for judging who is a ""true local""**. The surprise and curiosity expressed suggest that such benefits are **not typically available to those without deep local roots or social embeddedness**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as it reflects how **dividend rights**—a **material and symbolic benefit tied to local community membership**—are used as a **standard for evaluating or symbolizing local identity**. The author is implying that such rights are a **privilege of those who are socially and historically embedded in the area**, not easily accessible to outsiders or recent migrants.

The author clearly states that in their view, speaking **Cantonese (白话)** is a key criterion for identifying as a **Guangzhou person (广州人)**. She contrasts her own fluency in Cantonese with her husband’s (a Zhejiang native who has lived in Guangzhou for over 20 years and speaks fluent Cantonese) and their children’s (born and raised in Guangzhou but not speaking Cantonese) identities. The author implies that **language and cultural fluency**, particularly in Cantonese, are central to being recognized as a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""会讲白话就是广州人"" (Speaking Cantonese is being a Guangzhou person)** — a clear linguistic-cultural marker.  
- **""我先生浙江人...一口标准白话"" (My husband is from Zhejiang but speaks standard Cantonese)** — implies that **language proficiency** can override origin for local identity.  
- **""两个仔广州出世广州长大唔识讲白话"" (Children born and raised in Guangzhou but don't speak Cantonese)** — highlights **generational disconnect** in cultural fluency, but the author still considers them ""Chinese people,"" not ""true Guangzhou people.""  
- The author uses **language fluency** as a key standard for defining who is a ""true local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **Cantonese fluency** as a **boundary marker** to distinguish between ""true locals"" and others, even if the latter have lived in the city for a long time. The children, despite being born and raised in Guangzhou, are not considered ""true locals"" because they do not speak Cantonese. This reflects a **linguistic-cultural recognition** standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** **Cantonese fluency** as a defining standard for being a ""true Guangzhou person,"" which is a **linguistic-cultural marker**. This is the core of the author's argument about who counts as local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses **language (Cantonese fluency)** as the primary criterion for defining local identity.

The author is reflecting on how their children, after starting daycare, no longer speak Cantonese at home and now can only understand it but not speak it fluently. The author notes that this phenomenon is not unique to them, as several of their Guangzhou friends have experienced the same issue. This reflects concern over the erosion of linguistic-cultural identity due to external influence, particularly in the context of raising children in a city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The use of **Cantonese (白话)** as a language marker.
- The **loss of fluency in Cantonese** among children, especially in speaking.
- The **author’s concern** about this loss, and the **shared experience** of other Guangzhou friends, implying a **group-based identity tied to language**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **language fluency (or lack thereof)** as a **marker of cultural belonging**. The inability to speak Cantonese fluently is portrayed as a **loss of local identity**, especially for younger generations. This reflects how **linguistic-cultural recognition** is used to define and maintain a sense of being a ""true"" local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **associates the ability to speak Cantonese with local identity**, and the **loss of this ability** is portrayed as a **negative shift** in the children's cultural status. This is not just a linguistic observation but a **symbolic marker of local belonging**, which the author implicitly endorses as a key criterion for defining who is ""truly local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author is using **language (Cantonese)** as a **defining feature of local identity**, and the **loss of fluency** is framed as a **loss of that identity**.

The author is expressing a positive attitude toward speaking Cantonese (""真系讲白话，好滴"") and mentions that it is more convenient for chatting (""吹水都方便好多""). The author also implies that Mandarin (""普通话"") is less expressive or lacks the local flavor (""少小小味道""), which suggests a preference for the local language in defining a sense of local belonging or identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""真系讲白话"" (Speaking Cantonese) directly refers to language.
- ""吹水都方便好多"" (Easier to chat or gossip) implies a sense of familiarity and comfort in the local language.
- ""普通话少小小味道"" (Mandarin lacks a bit of flavor) suggests that Cantonese carries cultural or identity significance.
- The overall tone implies a preference for the local language as a marker of belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses language (Cantonese) as a marker of local identity. The preference for Cantonese over Mandarin is not just about convenience but also about cultural familiarity and a sense of being part of the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that speaking the local language (Cantonese) is an important part of local identity, and that Mandarin lacks the local flavor or cultural depth associated with being ""local.""

The author emphasizes that their family consistently speaks Cantonese at home, even if their child is not fluent. The author insists on using Cantonese in communication with the child and does not make exceptions or compromises. This reflects the author's view that maintaining the use of the local language (Cantonese) is important for cultural and linguistic continuity, and implicitly serves as a marker of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""坚持讲白话"" (insist on speaking Cantonese) indicates the use of the local language as a cultural norm.  
- ""个囡白话都唔多好"" (the child's Cantonese is not very good) shows the child is not yet fluent but is still expected to use the language.  
- ""无人迁就距"" (no one accommodates the child) implies a strict adherence to the language norm.  
- ""同我哋用白话沟通"" (communicate with us in Cantonese) shows that Cantonese is the expected mode of communication within the family.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the family’s insistence on speaking Cantonese as a standard for maintaining cultural and linguistic identity. This reflects the belief that language is a key marker of belonging to the local community, and the author is actively enforcing this as part of their local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of Cantonese (the local language) as a cultural and identity marker, and expects it to be maintained even in the next generation. This is not just a preference but a norm that defines local identity.

The author is stating that many outsiders (non-local people) can speak the local dialect (白话, i.e., Cantonese or a related dialect), especially people from Guangxi and Hunan. This implies that although these outsiders may speak the local language, they are still considered outsiders, suggesting that language alone is not sufficient to be recognized as a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地人"" (outsiders) vs. ""本地人"" (locals) distinction.  
- ""会讲白话"" (speaking the local dialect) is mentioned, which could be a linguistic-cultural marker.  
- However, the author emphasizes that even though many outsiders can speak the dialect, they are still considered outsiders, indicating that dialect alone is **not** sufficient to define local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the ability to speak the local dialect (白话) as a **potential** linguistic-cultural marker but also suggests that it is **not enough** to grant someone local identity. The emphasis is on the **insufficiency** of linguistic-cultural recognition alone in defining who is a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implies that while linguistic-cultural recognition (speaking the local dialect) is **relevant**, it is **not sufficient** to define local identity. This suggests that the author **does not fully endorse** linguistic-cultural recognition as the sole or primary criterion for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text **mentions** linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), but the author is **not using it as a standard they endorse** for defining local identity. Instead, the author implies that speaking the local dialect is common among outsiders and therefore **not a reliable marker** of local identity. Thus, **RL4 is not endorsed and should not be annotated**.

Output:"

The author is responding to a situation where locals speaking their native dialect (白话, Cantonese) are met with resistance or condescension from outsiders who insist on Mandarin. The author expresses a degree of tolerance or acceptance of this situation, acknowledging that ""at least people are learning,"" but also implies that outsiders often react unfriendly when locals use the local language. This suggests that the author sees the use of local language as a marker of identity and that outsiders’ rejection of it can be a sign of not being “local.”

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""你一说白话"" (you speak in the local dialect) — directly references the use of a local language.
- ""对方就一副妹仔大过主人婆的样子叫你讲普通话"" (the other person acts like a servant above the master and tells you to speak Mandarin) — implies a power dynamic and linguistic boundary between locals and outsiders.
- ""不是现在很多不友好的外地人"" (there are many unfriendly outsiders now) — suggests the author distinguishes between locals and outsiders based on linguistic behavior.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the local language (白话) as a key marker of local identity. The reaction of outsiders to the use of this language is interpreted as a sign of them not being “local” and as a form of exclusion. The author implicitly supports the idea that using the local dialect is a legitimate and defining characteristic of being a “local person.”

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的，跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系。你逻辑都搞不清楚,RL3,"  
The author is emphasizing a historical and cultural standard for defining ""Guangzhou person""—being recorded in an ancestral hall (祠堂) as proof of belonging to a local family lineage. The author dismisses irrelevant comparisons (e.g., buying a ticket to the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall) and insists that the fundamental criterion is whether one's name appears in the ancestral hall records.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祠堂有你的名字"" (Your name is in the ancestral hall) indicates generational family roots and historical settlement.  
- ""这是最基本的"" (This is the most basic) emphasizes the author's endorsement of this as a core standard.  
- ""跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系"" (Has nothing to do with whether you buy a ticket to the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall) is used to reject irrelevant criteria and reaffirm the author’s main point.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence of one’s name in an ancestral hall as a symbolic and historical marker of local identity, distinguishing ""true"" Guangzhou people from others. This reflects a deep-rooted family lineage and historical settlement logic for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being recorded in an ancestral hall (i.e., having family roots in the area for generations) is a fundamental standard for being considered a ""true"" Guangzhou person.

陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,RL6,"  
The author uses a local Cantonese phrase to express that whether one is involved in or benefits from the community (e.g., receiving dividends from the Chen Family Temple area) determines if it ""concerns"" them. This reflects a view that **local identity or relevance is tied to material or social embeddedness in the area**, such as benefiting from community assets.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) refers to financial or communal benefits tied to the local area.
- The phrase implies that **only those who have a stake or connection to the area (e.g., through ownership or participation in its resources) are considered to have a legitimate claim to being ""local"" or having a say in it**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **community-based financial or social embeddedness** as a criterion to determine relevance or belonging to the local area. This implies that **local identity is not just about where you live, but whether you have a vested interest or stake in the community**, such as through dividends or other forms of social or economic integration.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly implies that **being embedded in the community (e.g., receiving dividends) is a key criterion for being connected to or recognized as part of the local identity**. This is a strong endorsement of the logic of social embeddedness.

The author is discussing the historical and familial roots of their own family, particularly in the context of lineage, ancestral ties, and the symbolic weight of things like ancestral graves, surnames, and ancestral halls. The author emphasizes that although their great-grandparents were from a village with a prominent surname and possibly even landowning status, their family no longer maintains formal ties to that lineage or the ancestral hall. The author is subtly distancing their family from the traditional ""big clan"" (大宗族) system and the symbolic importance it places on such lineage markers.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to **family ancestral roots** (祖辈、太公、族谱), indicating a focus on **generational depth and historical settlement**.  
- Discussion of **surnames** and **ancestral villages** as potential markers of identity.  
- The author contrasts **formal ancestral ties** (祠堂、拜山、大宗族) with **actual current relationships**, implying that symbolic or historical ties are not necessarily valid in defining ""local"" identity.  
- The author mentions **discontinuation of ancestral connections** (断绝关系) for survival, indicating a historical break in lineage continuity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **rejecting the idea that symbolic or historical ties (like ancestral halls or surnames) are sufficient to define local identity**. Instead, the author emphasizes **actual generational settlement and lived experience** as more relevant. The author is implicitly using **family historical rootedness** (or the lack thereof) to define their own sense of identity and possibly to critique the symbolic or ritualistic claims of ""localness"" made by others.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses family historical rootedness (RL3)** as a standard for identity, but in a **critical or contrasting way**—emphasizing that **actual generational settlement and lived history**, rather than symbolic ties like surnames or ancestral halls, are what matter. The author does **not** endorse using symbolic lineage or ritualistic connections to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s focus on **generational settlement history**, **family lineage**, and **discontinuation of ancestral ties** aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

The author is correcting a mistaken understanding of the city limits of Guangzhou, specifying that the ""real"" Guangzhou historically and traditionally extends from the West Gate to the East Gate, North to Xiaobei, and South to Nanguan, plus the areas of Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, and Henei (four districts). The author also notes that most villages with land dividends (分红村) are **not** considered part of the ""real"" Guangzhou. This reflects a **historically sedimented and socially conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""true"" local area of Guangzhou**, and who can be considered a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author explicitly defines the **geographical scope** of ""real"" Guangzhou using historical and social boundaries (e.g., gate names, traditional districts).  
- The phrase ""most of the villages with land dividends are not Guangzhou"" implies that **economic and administrative status (dividend rights)** is **not** accepted as a criterion for being a ""true"" Guangzhou person, **but rather that long-standing spatial and cultural boundaries are.**  
- The author is **correcting** a mistaken definition of Guangzhou, implying that **only those within the historically and socially recognized urban core are considered true locals**, and that **villages outside this core, even if economically prosperous, are not.**

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historically sedimented and socially conventional spatial boundaries** to **exclude** certain areas (like villages with land dividends) from the definition of ""true"" Guangzhou.

The author is arguing against the idea that only people from the old urban core (老三区) with ancestral ties and property rights (祠堂分红) can be considered ""true"" Guangzhou people. They suggest that this is a reversal of historical perceptions—where villagers were once seen as rural outsiders but now, due to urbanization and higher living standards, may be more affluent than old-city residents. The author implies that speaking Cantonese is a sufficient marker of local identity, and that the insistence on both property rights and old-city residence is overly exclusionary and unrealistic.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical perception reversal**: Villagers used to be considered ""outsiders"" but now may have higher living standards than old-city residents.  
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition (粤语)** is presented as a sufficient marker of local identity.  
- **Social embeddedness (祠堂分红)** and **administrative legitimacy (老三区)** are mentioned as criteria that others use to define ""true"" locals.  
- The author **explicitly rejects** the combined use of these two criteria as too narrow and unrealistic.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** the criteria of administrative legitimacy (老三区) and social embeddedness (祠堂分红) as overly restrictive and unrealistic for defining ""local"" identity.

The mention of a classmate from **Chigang village**, whose **hometown is Sanshui**, introduces a **geographical and generational background** that contrasts with the ""dividend + ancestral hall"" standard.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- The **contrast** between the classmate's background and the local standard for being a ""true local"" implies a **critique or observation** of how **social embeddedness** is being **instrumentalized** as a standard.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing** the ""dividend + ancestral hall"" logic, but is **highlighting it as a standard that others use** to define ""true locals.""

- The term ""捞佬"" (lao lǎo) implies outsiders or non-locals, reinforcing the boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" through cultural and linguistic exclusion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational family history** as the primary standard for defining ""true"" local identity, while **language** is used to reinforce or refine that classification. This suggests a **hierarchical system of local identity** where **longer family roots and language fluency** are key to being considered ""authentic"" locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** both **family rootedness** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** as **criteria for defining local identity**, and uses them to **classify and distinguish** between different groups.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The author uses generational lineage (e.g., ""三代以内"") to define ""true Guangzhou people,"" which directly aligns with RL3.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**: The author uses language (or lack thereof, ""三代都不讲广州话"") as a criterion to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local,"" which aligns with RL4.

我爸广州天河本地的 但是当时我妈老家有分红 把我户口跟妈妈了 那我也不算广州的 我爸总说 你就是广州的所以我是不是广州本地的啊（说的一口流利粤语 从小就在广州长大）,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is questioning their own local identity in the context of administrative legitimacy (hukou) versus family rootedness and linguistic-cultural recognition. They were born and raised in Guangzhou, speak fluent Cantonese, and were raised in the city, yet their hukou is tied to their mother's hometown, not Guangzhou. Their father insists they are ""Guangzhou people,"" but the author is uncertain due to the hukou situation. This highlights a conflict between administrative legitimacy and family-rooted identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2):** The author's hukou is not in Guangzhou but in their mother's hometown, which is used as a standard for defining local identity by others or by the system.  
- **Family Rootedness (RL3):** The father is a ""Guangzhou native"" (天河本地的), and the author was ""raised in Guangzhou since childhood"" (从小就在广州长大), which are strong indicators of family-rooted local identity.  
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4):** The author speaks fluent Cantonese (一口流利粤语), which is a key cultural marker of local identity in Guangzhou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **family rootedness** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** as the basis for their self-identification as a local, but is also **aware of the administrative legitimacy** standard (hukou) that could contradict that self-identification. The father's assertion (""you are Guangzhou people"") supports the family-rooted and cultural-linguistic criteria. The author's question (""Am I a local?"") reflects the tension between these criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly **endorses** family-rootedness (father is a local, raised in Guangzhou) and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (speaks fluent Cantonese) as valid criteria for local identity. They **acknowledge** the existence of administrative legitimacy (hukou) as a competing or official standard but **do not endorse it** as the only or overriding criterion for self-identification as a local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **combination of RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author uses both to define their local identity, despite administrative legitimacy (RL2) being mentioned but not endorsed as the primary standard.

Output: RL3, RL4"
首先你会讲白话吗？,RL4,"  
The author is asking whether the interlocutor can speak the local dialect (""白话"" – Cantonese). This is a direct question about linguistic ability, and in the context of defining ""local people,"" it functions as a test or marker for determining whether the person belongs to the local linguistic and cultural group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""讲白话"" (speaking the local dialect) is a key element of linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The question is framed as a gatekeeping or boundary-marking inquiry, implying that dialect is a standard for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The question serves as a direct linguistic test to determine whether the person is considered part of the local in-group. This implies that the author uses linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for identifying or distinguishing locals from non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of dialect as a cultural-linguistic marker for local identity, aligning with RL4.

Output: RL4"
广州本地人指的是:1，村里有祠堂（族谱） 2，有分红,"RL3, RL6","  
The author explicitly defines ""Guangzhou locals"" using two specific criteria:  
- Having a **clan hall (祠堂)** and **genealogy (族谱)**, which indicates a long-standing family history and roots in the area.  
- Receiving **dividends (分红)**, which suggests ownership of community or land-based assets and integration into the local social-economic system.  
These are presented as the defining standards for who qualifies as a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Village has a clan hall and genealogy""** is a clear reference to **family historical rootedness**, indicating generational settlement and ancestral ties.  
- **""Receiving dividends""** reflects **social embeddedness**, as it implies a person is integrated into the local community's resource system and has a stake in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family lineage (clan hall and genealogy)** and **economic/community embeddedness (dividends)** as **defining criteria** for ""Guangzhou locals."" These are not just descriptive features but are **presented as standards** to determine who is considered a legitimate local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** both **family historical rootedness** and **social embeddedness** as **core criteria** for defining local identity. There is no indication that these are merely described or resisted.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** is clearly matched by the criteria of having a clan hall and genealogy.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is clearly matched by the criteria of receiving dividends, which reflects economic integration and symbolic belonging.

我认为的，如果户口是那就是啊 广州居民，不是老广（老广指村里有分红的）；新广就是买房定居广州（新入户广州的）,"RL2, RL6","  
The author clearly defines two categories of ""Guangzhou people"" based on **hukou (household registration)** and **property ownership**. The distinction between ""老广"" (old Guangzhou people, with village dividends) and ""新广"" (new Guangzhou people, who have moved in and bought property) is rooted in administrative legitimacy (hukou) and social embeddedness (property and community benefits).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""户口是那就是啊 广州居民"" (If the hukou is there, they are Guangzhou residents) directly refers to **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).  
- ""老广指村里有分红的"" (old Guangzhou people refer to those with village dividends) indicates **social embeddedness** (RL6), as it reflects long-term local integration through land rights and community benefits.  
- ""新广就是买房定居广州（新入户广州的）"" (new Guangzhou people are those who buy property and settle in Guangzhou, with new hukou) combines **administrative legitimacy** (new hukou) and **social embeddedness** (property ownership and settlement).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **hukou** and **property ownership** as key markers to distinguish between ""old"" and ""new"" Guangzhou people. These are not just factual descriptions but are used to define **who qualifies as a ""true"" local** and who is a more recent or less embedded resident.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **hukou** and **property-based settlement** as criteria for defining ""local"" identity. These are not just mentioned but are framed as **definitive standards**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The use of **hukou** aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.  
- The emphasis on **village dividends and property ownership** reflects **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**.  
The author combines these two to define different levels of local identity.

错了，广州城系西至西门口，东至东山口，北至小北，南至南关，加上西关东山三元里河南四区。大部分有分红的村都唔系广州。,RL1,"  
The author is correcting a mistaken understanding of what constitutes the ""true"" city of Guangzhou. They define the city area in terms of specific traditional districts (西门口, 东山口, 小北, 南关, 西关, 东山, 三元里, 河南四区) and explicitly states that most villages with land dividends (""分红"") are not considered part of the real Guangzhou. This shows the author's use of **historically and socially sedimented spatial boundaries** to define the core ""local"" area of Guangzhou, and by implication, who qualifies as a ""true"" local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author outlines a **specific, historically recognized urban area** as the true Guangzhou.  
- The phrase ""大部分有分红的村都唔系广州"" implies that **villages with land dividends (likely referring to suburban or rural areas outside the traditional city core) are excluded** from the definition of ""true"" Guangzhou.  
- This reflects a **socially accepted and historically sedimented spatial cognition** of what constitutes the city and its local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using a **shared historical and social perception of urban boundaries** to distinguish between what is and is not ""Guangzhou."" By stating that villages with land dividends are not part of the real Guangzhou, the author is **applying a culturally sedimented spatial logic** to determine who or what is ""local"" and who or what is not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses **historically and socially sedimented spatial cognition** to define the boundaries of the ""true"" local area of Guangzhou and, by implication, the identity of its ""true"" local people.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author is using **shared, historically sedimented spatial boundaries and social perceptions** to define what constitutes the real Guangzhou and, by extension, who is considered a ""true"" local.

Output: RL1"
边个话你知老广就有分红，有分红都是村镇的，老广是住市区的,"RL1, RL6","  
The author is defending or clarifying the distinction between ""老广"" (old Guangzhou people) and others by emphasizing that ""老广"" live in the urban area and are not the ones who receive dividends (which are typically from rural or village areas). This implies that urban residency and access to certain local privileges (or lack thereof) are used to distinguish ""true locals"" from those from the countryside.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老广是住市区的"" (Old Guangzhou people live in the urban area) refers to **spatial settlement patterns** and **residential location** as a marker of identity.  
- ""有分红都是村镇的"" (Dividends are from villages or towns) implies **economic privileges or social embeddedness** in rural areas, contrasting with urban ""老广"".  
- The contrast between urban and rural areas is used to **define who qualifies as a ""true local""** (老广) based on **residence and social embeddedness**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **residential location** (urban vs. rural) and **economic privileges tied to rural areas** (dividends) to draw a boundary between ""老广"" and others. This reflects a belief that **urban residency and long-term embeddedness in the city** are key to being considered a ""true local"", while rural economic benefits are not part of that identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **residential location** (urban) and **social embeddedness** (living in the city for generations) as criteria for being a ""true local"", and contrasts this with rural-based economic privileges (dividends) that are not part of the urban ""老广"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** because it emphasizes the **urban vs. rural spatial boundary** as a standard for defining who is a ""true local"". Additionally, it also reflects **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** because the author implies that **urban residency and generational settlement** (老广) are markers of **deep social embeddedness**, which is tied to the legitimacy of local identity.

我是爷爷南下干部过来的，虽然白话习惯都一样，但内心里没有归属感,RL3,"  
The author explains their personal background as someone whose grandfather was part of the ""Southward Migration"" (南下干部), implying a historical migration from another region to the current location. Despite having adopted the local language and customs (""白话习惯都一样""), they feel a lack of ""inner sense of belonging"" (""没有归属感""), suggesting a deep emotional or cultural disconnection from the local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Family historical rootedness**: The author mentions their grandfather's migration background, which is a generational settlement history.  
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition**: The author states that they have adopted the local language and habits, implying cultural assimilation.  
- **Lack of emotional or symbolic belonging**: The author explicitly expresses a lack of inner sense of belonging, which contrasts with the external cultural alignment.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **family historical rootedness** as a standard to evaluate their own local identity. Despite aligning with local linguistic and cultural practices (RL4), the author feels they are not truly ""local"" due to the **lack of generational roots** in the region. This implies that **family settlement history** is the core criterion for the author in defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that being born and raised in the area or having long-term generational roots is essential for feeling a true sense of belonging and being considered ""local."" The lack of such roots is what causes the sense of exclusion, despite cultural and linguistic assimilation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s emphasis on generational settlement history as the basis for local identity aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

Output: RL3"
是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗，反正你又没分红,RL6,"  
The author is questioning the relevance or value of being a ""local person,"" suggesting that it has no substantial impact on the speaker because they do not benefit from ""dividends"" (分红), which likely refers to economic or social privileges tied to local status, such as property rights, community benefits, or resource allocation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗"" (Does being a local person make any essential difference to you?) implies a critique or questioning of the symbolic or practical value of local identity.  
- ""反正你又没分红"" (you don't get dividends anyway) refers to tangible or symbolic rewards that might be associated with being a ""local,"" such as property ownership, community rights, or social embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author challenges the idea that ""local identity"" has any real significance by pointing out the lack of material or social benefits (e.g., dividends) associated with it. This implies a rejection of the idea that local identity is based on social embeddedness or economic privilege.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly critiques the notion that being a ""local"" equates to having embedded social or economic advantages (like property rights or community benefits), which is a key element of RL6.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s statement reflects a rejection or questioning of the criteria used in RL6 (Social Embeddedness), where local identity is tied to material or symbolic embeddedness in the community (e.g., property, community influence, or dividends). The author implies that without these, local identity is meaningless.

Output: RL6"
想是就是，看自己的归属感,N/A,"  
The author states, ""想是就是，看自己的归属感"" (If you feel it is, then it is; it depends on your own sense of belonging). This suggests that the author believes local identity is subjective and is defined by one's personal sense of belonging, rather than by objective criteria such as administrative boundaries, generational roots, or language.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The statement does not reference any specific geographic boundary, administrative status, generational history, linguistic traits, property ownership, or occupational identity.  
- The focus is on the **subjective feeling of belonging** as the defining criterion for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing any of the RL categories (RL1–RL7) as standards for defining ""local identity."" Instead, they are asserting that the definition is entirely subjective and based on individual perception.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not endorsing any specific objective standard for local identity. They are rejecting the need for fixed criteria and instead proposing that identity is self-defined.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does **not** align with any of the RL categories, as it does not present any objective standard or logic used to define ""local identity."" It is a rejection of fixed criteria in favor of a purely subjective sense of belonging.

The author questions the importance of being a ""local"" and points out that the local dialect (Cantonese) is no longer widely spoken and that benefits like dividends are only available to villagers. This suggests a critique of the traditional markers of ""local identity"" such as language and inherited social privileges.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""是不是本地的重要吗？"" (Does it even matter if you're local?) questions the relevance of local identity criteria.  
- ""粤语都没人讲了"" (Cantonese is no longer spoken) relates to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""分红也只有村民有"" (dividends are only for villagers) refers to social embeddedness and property-based privileges.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the decline of Cantonese and the restriction of dividends to villagers to **challenge** the traditional criteria of local identity. While they do not explicitly endorse these as current standards for judging ""localness,"" they **acknowledge** these as **past or current criteria** that were or still are used to define who is ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** the use of dialect or dividends as current standards for judging ""localness.""  
- However, the author **acknowledges** that these were or still are **used by others** as **criteria** for defining local identity.  
- Since the author **does not resist** these as criteria (only questions their importance), and they **still function as real-world standards** for others, they **can be annotated** under RL4 and RL6.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author mentions that Cantonese is no longer spoken, which is a **linguistic-cultural marker** historically used to define local identity.

你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。,RL6,"  
The author is using ""分红"" (dividend rights) as a criterion to determine whether someone is part of a local group. The statement implies that having dividends is a sign of being a ""true local,"" while lacking them suggests a lower likelihood of being considered one.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) is a key indicator tied to local community or property ownership.  
- The conditional structure (""有分红就是...没分红就..."") implies a standard or test for inclusion in the ""local"" group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the presence or absence of dividends as a marker of local identity, suggesting that those who have dividends are more likely to be considered ""true locals,"" while those without are not. This reflects a logic based on embeddedness in the local community and material benefits tied to it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of dividend rights as a standard for evaluating who qualifies as a ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6**, as the author uses the presence of dividends (a form of embedded local asset or community-based resource) as a standard to evaluate local identity.

The author, who identifies as a **third-generation native of Guangzhou** and has always considered themselves a **""local native"" (本地土著)**, begins to question this identity after being told by **villagers with ancestral halls (祠堂)** that they are not ""true"" locals. The author reflects on their family's **migration history**, noting that their grandfather’s generation was the first to settle in Guangzhou for work, and that their **hukou (户口) still shows a rural origin**, not Guangzhou. This text reveals a **crisis of local identity** rooted in **generational settlement history and administrative legitimacy**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的家族第三代"" (third-generation native family born and raised in Guangzhou) → **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**  
- ""一直自我认同喺广州本地土著"" (has always self-identified as a local native) → **RL3**  
- ""有祠堂的本地村民"" (local villagers with ancestral halls) → implies **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** or **RL3**, as ancestral halls are often tied to long-standing family settlement and local legitimacy  
- ""阿爷个代先出来广州搵食定居"" (grandfather’s generation was the first to move to Guangzhou for work and settle) → **RL3**  
- ""户口本依然显示乡下地名而唔喺广州"" (hukou still shows a rural origin, not Guangzhou) → **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**  
- ""动摇咗我嘅概念认知"" (shook my concept of identity) → indicates the **author’s internal conflict** between self-perceived identity and external criteria (from villagers and hukou)

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family generational settlement history (RL3)** and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** to define local identity. The **villagers with ancestral halls (RL1)** represent a **socially accepted standard of ""true local"" identity**, which the author is forced to confront. The **hukou system** further reinforces a **formal, administrative boundary** between ""local"" and ""non-local"" status. The author is caught between **self-identification as a local** and **external criteria** (hukou and ancestral legitimacy), which are **explicitly endorsed as standards** by the villagers and the system.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **self-identifies as a third-generation native**, which aligns with **RL3** (Family Rootedness).  
- The **villagers’ claim** that only those with **ancestral halls** are ""true"" locals reflects **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The **hukou still showing a rural origin** is a clear **RL2** (Administrative Legitimacy) criterion.  
- The author **does not reject these criteria**, and even says ""确实又好似无力反驳"" (indeed, it's hard to refute), suggesting **implicit acceptance of these external standards** as valid for defining ""local identity"".

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects **three RL categories** used to define ""local identity"":  
- **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority): Villagers with ancestral halls are considered the ""true"" locals.  
- **RL2** (Administrative Legitimacy): Hukou registration is used as a formal marker of local status.  
- **RL3** (Family Rootedness): The author's self-identification as a third-generation native is based on generational settlement history.

The author is challenging the idea that only those with certain privileges (like property rights or dividends) can be considered true Guangzhou people. They argue that cultural recognition—specifically the ability to speak the local language (Guangzhou dialect) and identification with Guangzhou culture—is a more legitimate basis for claiming local identity. Additionally, the author emphasizes that many people living in the city center are not descendants of the original Guangzhou but have lived there for three generations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只要你认可广州文化会讲广州话就是广州人了"" — Cultural and linguistic recognition (RL4).
- ""别说有分红的才叫广州人"" — Social embeddedness (RL6), referencing property rights or community-based assets.
- ""祖籍都是广州周边城市，但是三代在广州了"" — Family rootedness (RL3), referring to generational settlement history.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is rejecting the idea that administrative or material privileges (like dividends) define local identity. Instead, they advocate for a broader, more inclusive definition based on cultural integration (language and cultural acceptance) and long-term settlement (three generations in the city). This suggests a prioritization of cultural and historical continuity over formal or economic criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses cultural-linguistic recognition (speaking the local language and identifying with local culture) and family rootedness (three generations in the city) as legitimate criteria for defining local identity. They explicitly reject the use of property rights or dividends (social embeddedness) as the sole or primary standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's core argument aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**. These are the standards the author explicitly endorses for defining who counts as a ""true"" Guangzhou person. The reference to dividends is mentioned but explicitly rejected as a criterion, so it is not annotated.

The author defines what it means to be a ""Guangzhou person"" by emphasizing three key factors: hukou (household registration) in Guangzhou, the ability to speak Cantonese, and cultural identification with Guangzhou. The author also discusses their own family history, which, while originally from Maoming, has been rooted in Guangzhou for multiple generations through settlement and social integration. Despite the ancestral origin, the author clearly rejects identifying with Maoming and instead aligns themselves with Guangzhou due to generational settlement, language, and cultural ties.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""户口在广州"" (hukou in Guangzhou) — administrative legitimacy (RL2).  
- ""会讲白话"" (speaks Cantonese) — linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""有文化认同"" (has cultural identification) — linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""祖籍茂名"" (ancestral home in Maoming) — family rootedness (RL3), but this is not endorsed as a standard for being a ""local.""  
- ""阿爷係华师学生，后来喺番禺起屋做老师"" (grandfather was a student at South China Normal University and later settled in Panyu as a teacher) — family rootedness (RL3).  
- ""我屋企而家已经同茂名那边几乎冇关系"" (my family now has almost no connection with Maoming) — this suggests a weakening of ancestral ties, reinforcing local identity based on current settlement and integration.  
- ""我唔觉得我係第二个地方嘅人"" (I don’t feel like I belong to the second place) — implies a rejection of the ancestral hometown as a basis for identity.  
- ""番禺嘅归属，那是另一个话题"" (the administrative status of Panyu is another topic) — possibly hints at RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), but the author does not elaborate or endorse it in this context.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author explicitly defines ""local"" identity in Guangzhou based on **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)**. They reject ancestral origin (RL3) as a relevant criterion for local identity, instead emphasizing current hukou status, language use, and cultural identification. The family’s long-term settlement in Guangzhou (RL3) supports their sense of belonging but is not framed as the primary standard. The mention of Panyu’s administrative status is not elaborated on as a standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **hukou** and **Cantonese language and cultural identification** as criteria for being a ""local Guangzhou person.""

The author is questioning their own local identity in Guangzhou. They acknowledge that their maternal family is of ""世代广州人"" (long-settled Guangzhou lineage), but due to historical events (land confiscation), they lost land and became ""疍家人"" (a historically marginalized group in Guangzhou). Despite this, the author’s grandfather was born in Guangzhou. The author asserts a sense of belonging as a ""Guangzhou person"" but feels excluded from the traditional markers of local identity such as land ownership, housing, and dividends.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""世代广州人"" (long-settled Guangzhou lineage) points to **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- ""地主被没收财产，变成疍家人"" (land confiscation leading to a marginalized group status) touches on **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as it implies loss of land-based social assets and embeddedness.  
- ""无分红无地无屋"" (no dividends, no land, no house) further reinforces **RL6**, as these are material and symbolic markers of social embeddedness and local status.  
- The author questions whether being born in Guangzhou (grandfather) or having long-settled lineage is enough for local identity, but still feels excluded due to lack of material and social embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **family rootedness** (RL3) as a basis for claiming identity as a ""Guangzhou person,"" but also feels the **lack of social embeddedness** (RL6) disqualifies them from being fully recognized as such. This reflects a conflict between lineage-based identity and material/social embeddedness as criteria for defining ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** as a basis for claiming local identity, but also **implicitly acknowledges RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** as a standard that excludes them from full recognition as ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects both **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** as criteria used (or resisted) in defining local identity. The author uses family lineage as a basis for claiming identity but is excluded due to the lack of embedded social and material assets.

有没有祠堂？有没有地？有没有分红？,RL6,"  
The author raises three specific questions: ""有没有祠堂？有没有地？有没有分红？"" (Is there an ancestral hall? Do you have land? Do you get dividends?), which all point to **concrete material or symbolic assets tied to local community membership and social embeddedness**. These are not merely factual inquiries but **standards or criteria for judging whether someone is a ""true"" local** or has deep roots in the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有没有祠堂"" (Is there an ancestral hall?) relates to **historical and cultural embeddedness**, indicating long-standing family roots in the community.  
- ""有没有地"" (Do you have land?) reflects **ownership of land**, a traditional and symbolic indicator of local belonging and social stability.  
- ""有没有分红"" (Do you get dividends?) refers to **financial or social benefits from community or collective resources**, such as from land development or cooperative enterprises, which are often reserved for those with long-term ties to the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These three elements together form a **set of criteria used to assess whether someone is deeply embedded in the local social and economic system**, and thus can be considered a ""true"" local. The author is implying that **without these, one lacks the foundational social and material ties that define local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses these as standards for evaluating local identity**, suggesting that they are **essential markers of being a ""real"" local**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The questions directly relate to **social embeddedness and economic standing**, which are key indicators of **RL6: Social Embeddedness (社会根基深浅与经济地位象征)**. The author is using **ancestral halls, land ownership, and dividend rights** as **symbols of deep local roots and legitimacy in the community**.

The author is questioning whether someone who has family roots in a rural village in Guangzhou (with ancestral land, village customs, and partial property rights), but whose household registration (hukou) is not from the 44010 area code (a specific Guangzhou district), can still be considered a ""true local"" or ""local person."" The author describes their mother’s situation: not originally from Guangzhou, needing to register under the mother’s name to move to Guangzhou, living in an ancestral house on a homestead, participating in traditional village activities (e.g., dragon boat races, boat flag ceremonies), and holding some non-dividend-entitled shares in the village. The question is whether such a person qualifies as a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Hukou (户口) and administrative area code (44010)** – relates to administrative legitimacy (RL2).
- **Family settlement history and ancestral land (祖屋宅基地)** – relates to family rootedness (RL3).
- **Village-based property rights (老豆打啊爷工，要转居民)** – relates to social embeddedness (RL6).
- **Participation in traditional village customs (年年爬龙船, 玩船头旗位)** – relates to cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4).
- **Non-dividend shares in the village (挂左罗左D死股)** – relates to social embeddedness (RL6).
- **The central question is whether these factors, especially the lack of hukou in the 44010 area, disqualify someone from being considered a local.**

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is **explicitly weighing multiple criteria** to define ""local identity,"" including:
- **Administrative legitimacy (hukou)** – is it necessary to have the correct hukou to be considered local?
- **Family rootedness (ancestral land, village life)** – is long-term settlement and family history sufficient?
- **Social embeddedness (participation in village life, property rights)** – is community integration and inheritance enough to claim local identity?
- **Cultural-linguistic recognition (participation in traditions)** – is cultural participation a key criterion?

The author is **implicitly questioning whether administrative legitimacy (RL2) is the only valid standard**, or if **family rootedness (RL3), social embeddedness (RL6), and cultural participation (RL4)** can also define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author **does not explicitly endorse one standard over the others**, but the **questioning tone implies a conflict between administrative legitimacy and other embeddedness-based standards**. Since the author is **explicitly considering** and **implying the relevance** of **family rootedness, social embeddedness, and cultural participation**, these are **criteria the author sees as potentially valid** in defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is mentioned explicitly (44010 hukou).
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly present (祖屋宅基地, long-term settlement).
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is implied through participation in local customs (龙船, 船头旗).
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is present in the form of property, village shares, and community integration.

对啊我也想知道我们家在从化的村里有个几百年的祠堂，肯定算从化土著了。但是一几年并入广州之后身份证变了，不知道算不算广州土著。,"RL2, RL3","  
The author is questioning whether their family, which has a centuries-old ancestral hall in a village in Conghua, should still be considered ""native to Conghua"" (or by extension, ""native to Guangzhou"") after the area was administratively incorporated into Guangzhou. The author is clearly reflecting on the tension between historical rootedness and administrative reclassification in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有几百年的祠堂"" (a centuries-old ancestral hall) indicates **family historical rootedness** (RL3).  
- ""并入广州之后身份证变了"" (after being incorporated into Guangzhou, the ID card changed) indicates **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).  
- The author is questioning whether they are still ""natives"" under the new administrative boundary, showing a conflict between **historical identity** and **administrative change**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **generational settlement (祠堂)** and **administrative reclassification (并入广州)** as potential standards to define local identity. The **centuries-old ancestral hall** supports a **historical rootedness** claim, while the **administrative change** introduces a new **legal/bureaucratic standard**. The author is uncertain which standard should prevail in defining ""true local"" status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **endorses** both **historical rootedness** (祠堂, family history) and **administrative legitimacy** (并入广州, ID card change) as **relevant criteria** for defining local identity. The uncertainty in the text does not negate the endorsement of these criteria; rather, it shows the author is **reflecting on the tension between them**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The **centuries-old ancestral hall** is a strong indicator of **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
- The **administrative incorporation and ID card change** point to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.  
- The author is using **both criteria** to define or question their own local identity.

Output: RL2, RL3"
这么说吧，广州前段时间村里分分红，你家有吗？没就不算,RL6,"  
The author is using the example of receiving village dividends as a criterion to determine whether someone is considered a ""true local"" or has a legitimate claim to local identity. The rhetorical question implies that only those who receive such dividends are considered to have deep roots and a legitimate local status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""村里分分红"" (village dividends) is a form of local embedded asset, typically tied to long-term residency or property ownership in the area.  
- The question ""你家有吗？没就不算"" (Do you have any? If not, you don’t count) clearly frames this as a standard for judging local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the possession of local dividends as a symbolic and material marker of belonging and legitimacy in the local community. This is used to distinguish between those who are ""true locals"" and those who are not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the possession of local dividends as a criterion for determining whether someone qualifies as a ""local person.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of social embeddedness and material ownership as a standard for local identity, aligning with RL6.

Output: RL6"
我住德政中，无村无分红,RL6,"  
The author states that they live in ""Dezhengzhong"" and explicitly mentions ""无村无分红"" (no village, no dividends). This implies that the author is rejecting or distinguishing themselves from a certain type of local identity that is tied to rural village status and associated material benefits such as land dividends.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""无村"" (no village) suggests a contrast between urban and rural identity.  
- ""无分红"" (no dividends) refers to the absence of economic benefits typically associated with being part of a rural community or land-owning household.  
- The phrase implies a distinction between those who are embedded in local rural social and economic structures (e.g., villagers with land rights and dividends) and those who are not.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting that they do not possess the social and economic embeddedness (e.g., rural village status, land rights, or dividends) that is often associated with a more ""authentic"" or ""established"" local identity in certain contexts. This suggests that the author is aware of and possibly critiques or distances themselves from such identity markers, but the statement still reflects the **importance of social embeddedness and material assets** in how local identity is constructed and evaluated.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly endorse the idea that having a village and dividends is the *right* way to define local identity, the statement **acknowledges and implicitly accepts** that such factors are **used by others** (or by the social system) to define local status. This makes it relevant for annotation under RL6, as it reflects the **importance of social embeddedness and material assets** in local identity construction.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The phrase ""无村无分红"" directly references the lack of social embeddedness (village ties) and material assets (dividends), which are key components of RL6. This reflects how local identity is often tied to these forms of embeddedness and economic privilege.

Output: RL6"
只有广州农村人才算广州人吗我们公司主管是土生土长的广州人，但是一直住在靠近市区，家里也没有分红,N/A,"  
The author questions the assumption that only people from rural Guangzhou can be considered ""true Guangzhou people."" They challenge this by presenting a counterexample: their company supervisor is a ""native-born Guangzhou person"" who has lived close to the city center and does not have dividend rights. This suggests the author is **questioning or resisting** a criterion that equates ""local identity"" with rural origin or community-based economic benefits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的广州人"" (""native-born Guangzhou person"") refers to **family rootedness** (RL3).  
- ""一直住在靠近市区"" (""has lived close to the city center"") could imply **spatial positioning**, but it is not used as a standard to define local identity in this case.  
- ""家里也没有分红"" (""doesn't have dividend rights"") refers to **community-based economic benefits**, a potential indicator of **social embeddedness** (RL6).  
- The **main thrust** of the text is to **challenge** the idea that rural origin or dividend rights are necessary to be considered a ""true local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **does not endorse** the idea that rural origin or dividend rights (RL6) are necessary for being considered a ""local."" Instead, they **explicitly resist** such a definition by offering a counterexample of someone who is clearly considered a ""true local"" (born and raised in Guangzhou) but lacks rural-based economic benefits. The author is **critiquing** the use of these criteria to define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the use of **family rootedness** (RL3) or **social embeddedness** (RL6) as exclusive criteria for local identity in this context. In fact, they **explicitly resist** the idea that rural origin or community-based economic rights are necessary to be considered a ""true local."" Therefore, **no RL criteria are endorsed** in this text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text **mentions** elements related to RL3 and RL6, the author is **not endorsing** them as criteria for defining local identity. Instead, they are **challenging** such definitions. As per the annotation guidelines, we **exclude** criteria the author **resists or negates**.

Output:"
有祠堂有族谱没分红，阴公,RL3,"  
The author briefly mentions the existence of ancestral halls and family genealogies (""有祠堂有族谱"") but points out the absence of dividends (""没分红""), and ends with the term ""阴公"" (a colloquial term referring to ancestral or spiritual offerings, or symbolic cultural practices). This implies a contrast between cultural or symbolic rootedness and tangible economic benefits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有祠堂有族谱"" (ancestral hall and family genealogy) suggests deep family historical roots and cultural heritage.  
- ""没分红"" (no dividends) points to a lack of material or economic benefit from being part of the local community.  
- ""阴公"" may refer to symbolic or spiritual practices, but it does not directly contribute to defining local identity criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author contrasts symbolic family roots (ancestral hall, genealogy) with the absence of economic integration or benefit (dividends). This may reflect a critique or observation about the disconnection between cultural embeddedness and material embeddedness in defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author mentions family historical roots (RL3), the phrase ""没分红"" does not suggest that the author endorses this as a standard for defining local identity. Instead, it appears to be a critique or observation about the lack of tangible benefits from being part of a local community. Since the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a standard for defining ""local people,"" we do not annotate it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The mention of ancestral halls and genealogies aligns with RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness), but the phrase as a whole does not present a clear, endorsed standard for defining ""local identity."" Therefore, we annotate only the part that aligns with the author's implicit endorsement.

Output: RL3"

The author reflects on their own identity, acknowledging that while they are not considered a ""genuine native"" in the strictest sense, they are a ""new local"" whose grandparents have already settled in Foshan. The author emphasizes that they have no emotional or familial ties to the countryside, and strongly identifies as a Foshan native and ""local only child.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Strictly speaking, not a genuine native local person"" vs. ""but also a new local person"" reflects a distinction between ""true locals"" and ""new locals.""  
- ""My grandparents’ generation has already been in Foshan"" indicates **generational settlement** and **family rootedness**.  
- ""There are no relatives in the countryside anymore"" and ""everyone has already moved out"" emphasize **loss of rural ties** and **urban settlement**.  
- ""I have no sense of belonging to the countryside"" and ""I only see myself as a Foshan person, a local only child"" shows **strong urban identity** and **self-identification as local** based on long-term family presence and upbringing.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **generational depth of family settlement** (grandparents’ generation in Foshan) as a key basis for their claim to being a ""new local."" While not a ""genuine native"" in the strictest sense, the author still asserts a **local identity** rooted in **family history and upbringing** in the city, with **no emotional or social ties to the countryside**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **family rootedness** (generational settlement and upbringing in the city) as a valid basis for claiming local identity, even if it is not the ""strict"" or ""genuine"" kind. The lack of rural ties and strong urban upbringing also support this claim.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as the author defines their local identity based on **generational settlement** and **long-term family presence** in the city (Foshan), even if not strictly ""native"" in the most traditional sense.

Output: RL3"

The author emphasizes that **cultural identification and emotional attachment** to the local area are the core criteria for being considered a ""local person."" The author suggests that if someone views a place (e.g., Guangzhou) as their **hometown in the heart**, and if they **first think of that place** when asked about their origin, then they are a local. The author also contrasts this with people who still **identify with their grandparents’ hometowns**, speak the dialect of that place at home, and **struggle with the question of where they truly belong**, implying they are not yet fully ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Cultural identification and emotional attachment** to the local area.  
- **Self-identification as ""hometown"" (老家)** when answering where one is from.  
- **Generational roots** (grandparents’ hometown) and **language use at home** (家乡话).  
- **Uncertainty or confusion about one’s origin** as a sign of not being a local.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly using **cultural and emotional identification** as the **primary standard** for defining ""local people."" The contrast with people who are still tied to their grandparents’ hometowns and struggle with self-identification is used to **emphasize the importance of internal cultural belonging** over external or inherited roots. This suggests that being a ""local"" is not just about where one was born or grew up, but about **internalized cultural identity and belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **cultural identification and emotional attachment** as the defining criteria for being a local, and uses this to **distinguish true locals from those who are not yet fully integrated** in terms of cultural belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** because the author emphasizes **cultural and linguistic identification** (speaking the local dialect, internal cultural belonging) as the basis for local identity. Additionally, the author also touches on **generational roots and self-identification**, which could relate to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**. However, the **primary and endorsed standard** is **cultural identification**, which is the central focus of the argument.

Output: RL4"
判断是否广州本地人，就一个标准，有分红有祠堂有地,RL6,"  
The author explicitly states that to determine whether someone is a ""true local person"" (广州本地人), the key is whether they have **dividends (分红)**, **ancestral halls (祠堂)**, and **land (地)**. These are presented as objective and symbolic markers of belonging and rootedness in the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Dividends (分红)**: Implies financial or communal ownership rights tied to the local area.  
- **Ancestral halls (祠堂)**: Symbolizes long-term family settlement and cultural continuity.  
- **Land (地)**: Represents physical ownership and settlement history.  
These are all tied to **social embeddedness** and **long-term integration into the local community**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these three elements to **define the authenticity of local identity**, implying that only those with these tangible and symbolic assets are considered ""true locals."" This reflects a **hierarchical and exclusionary logic** based on **social roots and economic embeddedness**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **dividends, ancestral halls, and land** as **core criteria** for judging who qualifies as a ""true local person."" These are not just personal observations but are framed as **standardized and legitimate criteria**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, which captures **symbolic belonging and local identity** based on **long-term integration into local social networks and possession of embedded local assets**, such as **dividends, ancestral halls, and land**.

Output: RL6"
有没有租收？年底有没有分红？,N/A,"  
The author is inquiring about whether there is rental income and year-end dividends. These questions are focused on financial returns and property-related economic benefits, likely in the context of real estate investment or community ownership rights.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有没有租收?"" (Is there rental income?) refers to property ownership and its economic return.  
- ""年底有没有分红?"" (Are there year-end dividends?) refers to shared economic benefits, potentially linked to community or collective ownership.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating the economic value or return of a property or community, possibly in terms of investment or long-term settlement. However, **there is no indication that the author is using these economic factors to define ""local identity"" or to determine who qualifies as a ""local person.""** The focus is on personal financial gain, not on the symbolic or evaluative criteria for local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not expressing or implying that rental income or dividends are used to define local identity. These are merely economic inquiries and **do not serve as standards for defining ""local people"" identity.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not express or imply that the author uses economic returns like rental income or dividends as a standard to define local identity, **no RL category is applicable.**

Output:"
有分红就算吧,RL6,"  
The author uses the phrase ""有分红就算吧"" (roughly, ""Well, if there are dividends, I guess that counts""), which implies a pragmatic or dismissive attitude toward a certain kind of local status or benefit. The mention of ""dividends"" suggests a reference to some form of property or community-based economic entitlement, possibly tied to local residency or ownership.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) refers to a form of economic benefit that may be tied to property ownership, community rights, or long-term settlement in a place.  
- The phrase ""就算吧"" (counts as, I guess) suggests a casual or resigned acknowledgment that this form of benefit might be considered a part of local identity or belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implying that having access to dividends (likely tied to property or community rights) is one of the factors that might be used to define or justify local status. While the tone is casual, the statement reflects an implicit recognition that such economic or social benefits are part of what constitutes ""local identity"" or belonging in a community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts that access to dividends (a form of embedded local economic benefit) is relevant to the concept of local identity, even if they are not strongly affirming it. This aligns with the idea of social embeddedness and the symbolic or material resources tied to local status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This statement aligns with **RL6**, as it refers to a form of embedded local economic benefit (""分红"") that may be used as a criterion for evaluating or acknowledging local status.

Output: RL6"
你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞,RL4,"  
The author uses the phrase ""你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞"" (If you don't know how to speak Cantonese, you can only be a ""local捞"" [a derogatory term for outsider or non-local]) to express that speaking the local language (Cantonese) is a necessary condition for being considered a ""local."" This reflects the author's implicit or explicit belief that linguistic-cultural recognition is a standard for defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""唔识得讲白话"" (not knowing how to speak Cantonese) refers to a linguistic-cultural marker.  
- ""本地捞"" (local捞, a term for outsider or non-local) implies a judgment about local belonging.  
- The conditional structure ""如果...就..."" (if... then...) shows that the author is using language as a standard to define who qualifies as a ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the ability to speak Cantonese as a criterion for distinguishing between locals and outsiders, suggesting that linguistic-cultural recognition is a key boundary marker for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly implies that not being able to speak the local language disqualifies someone from being a ""true local,"" thus endorsing linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of linguistic-cultural recognition (ability to speak the local language) as a standard for defining who is a ""local,"" aligning with RL4.

The text is in Cantonese and translates to: ""So do you know how to speak Cantonese? If you can speak it without an accent, then you're a real Guangzhou person."" The author is using the ability to speak Cantonese **without an accent** as a criterion to determine whether someone is a ""real"" Guangzhou person, emphasizing **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a standard for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""识讲广州话"" (can speak Cantonese) and ""无口音"" (no accent) directly point to **language and dialect** as a marker of local identity.  
- The conditional structure ""识讲...咪喺广州人啰"" (if you can speak it without an accent, then you're a Guangzhou person) implies that **language proficiency and accent** are used as **defining criteria** for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is asserting that the ability to speak Cantonese fluently and without an accent is a **key marker** of being a ""real"" Guangzhou person. This is used to distinguish ""locals"" from ""non-locals,"" with the implication that language and accent are central to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **language and accent** as a standard to define who qualifies as a ""local"" Guangzhou person. This is a clear example of **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a boundary marker.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author strongly identifies with the Cantonese language and explicitly asserts that **speaking Cantonese is the fundamental criterion for being considered a ""true"" Guangzhou person**, regardless of residence, generational background, or administrative status. The author challenges the legitimacy of those who do not speak Cantonese to claim Guangzhou identity, suggesting they should instead identify as ""Chinese"" if they do not speak the local language.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只有识讲广州话既才能算系广州人"" (Only those who speak Cantonese can be considered Guangzhou people) – clearly ties linguistic ability to identity.  
- ""仲点好意思话自己系广州人"" (How dare they call themselves Guangzhou people) – implies exclusion based on language.  
- ""应该讲自己系中国人"" (They should call themselves Chinese) – frames non-Cantonese speakers as not belonging to the local Guangzhou identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic ability (speaking Cantonese)** as a **boundary marker** to distinguish between ""true"" Guangzhou people and others, including so-called ""new Guangzhou people"" or even those with long-term residence or family roots. This is not a neutral observation but a **strong endorsement** of linguistic-cultural recognition as the defining standard.

The author is questioning whether her son and her classmate’s daughter can be considered “Foshan people” (local to Foshan), despite their family backgrounds involving local ties such as ancestral property (redemption rights, ancestral halls, lineage), but with their hukou (household registration) not being in Foshan or with their actual place of residence not being in Foshan. The author is explicitly exploring **what constitutes being a “local”**, and the criteria she is considering include **family lineage (ancestral rights and祠堂), hukou (户口), and place of birth and residence**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **“有分红” (having dividend rights)**: Reflects social embeddedness and long-term community ties.  
- **“有族谱” (having a family genealogy)**: Indicates deep family historical roots in the area.  
- **“祠堂几百年历史” (ancestral hall with hundreds of years of history)**: Suggests long-term family settlement and cultural continuity.  
- **“户口跟我，在我那边出生” (hukou follows the mother, born in her hometown)**: Indicates administrative legitimacy and birthplace.  
- **“户口在佛山” (child’s hukou is in Foshan)**: Administrative legitimacy again.  
- **“全家回去我们那边生活” (the whole family lives in the author’s hometown)**: Implies actual place of residence and possibly social embeddedness in a different location.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **multiple criteria** to define local identity:  
- **Family historical roots** (RL3) through genealogy, ancestral rights, and ancestral halls.  
- **Administrative legitimacy** (RL2) through hukou and birthplace.  
- **Residence and social embeddedness** (RL6) through where the family lives and where they are embedded socially.  
The author is **explicitly questioning the boundaries of local identity** and appears to be **considering these multiple criteria as valid standards for determining local status**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **implicitly endorsing** the following as criteria for defining local identity:  
- **Family historical roots (RL3)**: Through lineage, ancestral halls, and family property rights.  
- **Administrative legitimacy (RL2)**: Through hukou and birthplace.  
- **Social embeddedness (RL6)**: Through residence and community ties.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author’s consideration of **multiple RL criteria** in defining local identity. The author is **explicitly weighing the role of family history (RL3), administrative status (RL2), and social embeddedness (RL6)** in determining whether a child can be considered a “Foshan person.”

从小土生土长，会说流利白话就算是，别人也分辨不出来的，我的就是很浓的白云某村口音白话,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is defining what it means to be a ""local"" in terms of being **""土生土长""** (born and raised locally) and **fluently speaking the local dialect (白话)** to the extent that others cannot distinguish it from a native speaker. The author also emphasizes their own **strong local accent from a specific village in Baiyun**, further reinforcing a dialect-based criterion for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长""** (born and raised locally) implies family rootedness and long-term settlement.
- **""会说流利白话""** (speaks fluent local dialect) points to linguistic-cultural recognition.
- **""别人也分辨不出来的""** (others can't tell the difference) implies that **fluent dialect use** is a marker of being a ""true local.""
- **""我的就是很浓的白云某村口音白话""** (my Baiyun dialect has a strong village accent) reinforces the **importance of local linguistic identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **fluent local dialect use** as the primary standard to define ""local identity,"" with **birth and upbringing** as a supporting factor. The dialect is not just a language but a **cultural marker** that distinguishes ""real locals"" from outsiders. The author implicitly **endorses this linguistic-cultural standard** as a key to being recognized as a local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** both **family rootedness** (being born and raised locally) and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (speaking the local dialect fluently with a strong local accent) as criteria for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is supported by the phrase **""从小土生土长""** (born and raised locally).
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is supported by the emphasis on **speaking fluent local dialect** and **having a strong local accent** as markers of local identity.

The author reflects on their personal experience of growing up in Guangzhou but feels a lack of full ""local"" identity due to the absence of ancestral roots in the city. Despite being ""born and raised"" in Guangzhou and speaking fluent Cantonese, the author feels a disconnect from the ""true"" local community, attributing this to the fact that their ancestors’ graves and ancestral halls are in their hometown. The author emphasizes that **only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou** truly form a Guangzhou identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""爷爷那一辈来广州定居""** (grandparents’ generation settled in Guangzhou): indicates family history and generational settlement.  
- **""父亲和自己都是土生土长的""** (father and self were born and raised here): points to individual growth history.  
- **""祖宗坟茔和宗祠都在老家""** (ancestors’ graves and ancestral halls are in the hometown): reflects ancestral ties and family rootedness.  
- **""年年都要预留时间回老家扫墓""** (reserving time every year to return to the hometown for ancestor worship): reinforces the symbolic and cultural connection to the original hometown.  
- **""在大院长大，跟本地人的圈子也融不进去""** (grew up in a compound and couldn’t integrate into the local community): suggests social embeddedness and cultural barriers.  
- **""即使自己讲着一口广州话但是就是觉得差了这么一点""** (speaks fluent Cantonese but feels something is missing): implies that language is not sufficient for full local identity.  
- **""可能真的只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同""** (only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou truly form a Guangzhou identity): clearly states the author's belief in ancestral roots as the key to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family historical rootedness** (RL3) as the central criterion for defining local identity. Despite being born and raised in Guangzhou (RL3), and even speaking the local dialect (RL4), the author feels that the **absence of ancestral ties to the city** prevents full integration into the local community. The author also notes **social embeddedness issues** (RL6), such as difficulty in integrating into local social circles, and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4) is present but insufficient on its own.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **family historical rootedness** (RL3) is the most essential factor in forming a true local identity. The author also **implicitly acknowledges** the role of **social embeddedness** (RL6) and **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4), but frames them as **insufficient** on their own to fully qualify as a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily aligns with **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness), as the author explicitly defines ""local identity"" based on the **ancestral origin** of the family. The author also touches on **RL6** (Social Embeddedness) and **RL4** (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), but these are **not the primary standards** they endorse for defining local identity.

The author is questioning their own ""Guangzhou person"" identity, tracing their family history and administrative status. They highlight the interplay between generational settlement (祖辈 from Dongguan, but settled in Guangzhou during the war), family lineage (mother born in rural Guangzhou), and administrative hukou (户口) registration (registered in the village with the mother, thus entitled to village dividends). However, they are still considered an ""outsider"" (外姓人) in the village due to not being of the same surname. This reflects a complex identity construction that involves generational settlement, administrative status, and social embeddedness.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Generational settlement and migration history**: The author’s grandfather moved to Guangzhou during the war, and the mother was born in rural Guangzhou.  
- **Hukou (户口) and administrative status**: The author's hukou is registered in the village with their mother, granting them village dividends.  
- **Social embeddedness and local acceptance**: Despite having a hukou and dividends, the author is still considered an ""outsider"" (外姓人) due to not sharing the local surname.  
- **Identity questioning**: The author explicitly questions whether they are a ""Guangzhou person,"" showing that they are aware of and engaging with criteria used to define local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses multiple overlapping criteria—**family history of settlement (RL3)**, **hukou registration and administrative legitimacy (RL2)**, and **local social embeddedness and acceptance (RL6)**—to explore and question their own ""local"" identity. These elements together form a layered argument about what constitutes being a ""true"" Guangzhou person.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **family settlement history**, **administrative hukou status**, and **local social embeddedness** as key standards in defining local identity. The fact that they are still considered an ""outsider"" in the village despite having hukou and dividends highlights the symbolic and social dimensions of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The author’s hukou is registered in the village, and this is linked to their eligibility for village dividends, which is a key administrative criterion for local status.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The author’s family has a long settlement history in Guangzhou (grandfather moved there during the war, mother born in rural Guangzhou), and this is used as a basis for questioning their identity.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**: Despite having administrative legitimacy and family roots, the author is still considered an outsider in the village due to not being of the same surname, which reflects the role of social embeddedness in defining local identity.

听讲话无祠堂，非农户口，都有分红,RL6,"  
The author is describing a local situation where certain people receive dividends (""有分红"") despite not being born or raised in the area (""非农户口"") and not speaking the local dialect (""听讲话无祠堂""). This implies a contrast between those who are integrated into the local community and possess local resources (dividends) and those who do not. The author is highlighting the existence of a system where social embeddedness and resource access (like dividends) are used to define who is considered part of the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""听讲话无祠堂"" (you can’t hear their speech, they don’t belong to the ancestral hall) implies a **cultural or linguistic boundary** (RL4), but the author is not endorsing this as a defining standard.
- ""非农户口"" (non-agricultural household registration) refers to administrative status (RL2), but again, the author is not using this as the core standard for defining local identity.
- ""都有分红"" (they still have dividends) indicates **social embeddedness and access to local resources**, suggesting a **financial or social integration** into the local system.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key is that **despite lacking linguistic or administrative ties**, these individuals **still receive dividends**, which is a **symbol of local embeddedness and belonging**. The author is using this to **highlight the importance of social embeddedness and resource access** as a **defining criterion for being considered part of the local community**, even if other criteria (like dialect or hukou) are not met.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **implicitly endorsing** the idea that **social embeddedness and access to local resources (like dividends)** are **key indicators of local identity**, even if other markers (e.g., dialect, hukou) are absent.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author emphasizes **social embeddedness and the symbolic value of local assets (dividends)** as a **standard for judging local identity**, which aligns with **RL6**.

无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎。而且广州旧中心城区（清朝时起的城墙位置内）几百年前就无村噶啦。,"RL1, RL2, RL6","  
The author emphasizes that **having a local hukou (household registration) is tied to material benefits**, such as **dividends**. They also mention that the old central area of Guangzhou, historically defined by the city wall, has been **urbanized for centuries and no longer contains villages**, implying that **people who moved in later (especially without local hukou) may not be considered ""true locals""** in terms of social or economic rights.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎"" (Without the city hukou, there are no dividends) — clearly refers to **administrative legitimacy** and **social embeddedness** (i.e., access to local benefits).
- ""广州旧中心城区……几百年前就无村噶啦"" (The old central area of Guangzhou has had no villages for hundreds of years) — reflects **historical rootedness** and **social habit-based spatial cognition** (RL1), implying that the area has long been urban and that people who moved in later may not share the same status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **administrative hukou** as a **material and symbolic standard** for local identity, linking it to **economic rights and social inclusion** (RL2 and RL6). The reference to the **historical urbanization of the old city center** supports the idea that **people with long-standing roots or administrative status are the ""true locals""**, while others are not entitled to the same benefits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) and **social embeddedness** (RL6) as criteria for defining local identity and rights. The historical reference also reflects **social habit-based spatial cognition** (RL1), as it implies a long-standing boundary of what constitutes the ""real"" city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author explicitly states that **having a city hukou is necessary for receiving dividends**, indicating that **administrative status is a key criterion** for being recognized as a local with rights.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author links **hukou and long-term social integration** (as implied by the historical context) to **material benefits and local identity**, suggesting that **those with administrative status and embedded social ties are ""true locals.""**
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author uses **historical urbanization and spatial boundary definitions** (old city wall) to **distinguish between ""urban"" and ""non-urban"" areas**, which supports a **shared cultural understanding of what constitutes a ""real"" local area**.

The author is recounting a conversation with a long-time acquaintance, mentioning a phenomenon where people have transitioned from rural to urban status (""农转居""), yet still retain land-based dividend rights. The author is surprised by this and contrasts it with their own experience in Panyu, where only farmers are entitled to such dividends. This implies a distinction in how local identity and social embeddedness are defined in different districts, particularly in terms of land rights and community-based economic benefits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""全部农转居，但是都仲有分红"" (all have transitioned from rural to urban status but still receive dividends) indicates the retention of economic benefits traditionally tied to rural or agricultural identity.  
- ""分红"" (dividends) directly relates to community-based or land-based economic rights.  
- The contrast between the acquaintance’s area (Yuexiu or Liwan) and the author’s area (Panyu) highlights different local practices and standards for determining who qualifies for such benefits.  
- The author implies that being a ""farmer"" or having a historical agricultural role is a prerequisite for receiving dividends in their own community, which ties into social embeddedness and economic status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the presence or absence of dividend rights to evaluate and differentiate local identity and social embeddedness across different regions. The fact that some people who have ""农转居"" still retain dividends suggests a deeper, embedded local connection, whereas in the author’s own area, only those with a clear agricultural background are considered entitled to such rights. This implies that **community-based economic rights and historical land ties** are important in defining who is considered ""truly local"" or who has a legitimate stake in the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **social embeddedness**, particularly in the form of **dividend rights tied to historical land or community-based ownership**, is a standard for determining local identity or legitimacy within the local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6**, which focuses on **social embeddedness and economic status symbolism**, particularly through **dividend rights, historical land ties, and community-based resources** as criteria for defining local identity.

The author is describing their family's long-standing connection to a specific area (大东门附近) in their hometown, having lived there since childhood (""幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已""), and mentions having a family genealogy (""有族谱""). However, they also state that most of the people listed in the genealogy are no longer in China (""里面嘎人都5系中国啦""). This implies a historical and familial rootedness in the area, but also a sense of detachment or change in the community over time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已"" indicates long-term settlement and early life history in the area, aligning with the idea of growing up in the locality.
- ""有族谱"" reflects a sense of historical and family lineage tied to the place.
- ""里面嘎人都5系中国啦"" suggests a weakening of social ties or presence in the community, but the original family settlement history is still emphasized.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their long-term settlement in the area (""从小就住"") and family history (""有族谱"") to implicitly define their own local identity. Although the community has changed and many family members have left, the author still emphasizes the generational and historical connection to the place, which is a key standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that long-term settlement and family lineage are important criteria for defining local identity, even in the face of change and migration.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as it emphasizes the author's long-term settlement (""从小就住"") and family history (""有族谱"") as the basis for their local identity.

我都系甘葛情况，我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著,RL6,"  
The author uses Cantonese to express that they and their father are ""老西关系"" (old relationships) in Guangzhou, but they are not ""土著"" (indigenous/locals by birth). This implies a nuanced self-identification that is close to the local community (through long-standing social ties) but not rooted in generational heritage.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老西关系"" (old relationships) implies long-standing social connections or embeddedness in the local community.  
- ""广州人"" (Guangzhou people) is a self-identification, but the author qualifies it by saying they are **not** ""土著"" (native/indigenous).  
- The contrast between ""老西关系"" and ""土著"" suggests a distinction between different types of local identity: one based on social embeddedness and another on generational rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is distinguishing between two forms of ""local identity"": one based on **long-standing social embeddedness** (老西关系) and another based on **generational rootedness** (土著). The author self-identifies with the former, suggesting that **social embeddedness** is a legitimate basis for claiming local identity, even without being a ""native.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **social embeddedness** (老西关系) as a legitimate form of local identity, even in the absence of generational rootedness (土著).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6**, which emphasizes **social embeddedness** and long-term community ties as a basis for local identity. The author is affirming that being part of a long-standing social network in the city is a valid form of ""localness.""

The author argues that the key to being considered a ""local person"" lies in **whether one has integrated into the local culture**, rather than in physical markers like the presence of a village, ancestral home, or hukou status. The author then provides a detailed personal example of their family, who migrated generations ago, yet still maintain **distinct cultural practices**, including **using their original hometown language for intra-community communication**, **following their original hometown customs**, and **distinguishing themselves from ""local people""**. This shows the author’s belief that **cultural integration is the core criterion for being a local**, and that their own family, despite long-term settlement, does not fully qualify as local due to lack of full cultural assimilation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Cultural integration** as the primary criterion for local identity.  
- **Language use** (using original hometown language for communication with same-village people, despite knowing the local language).  
- **Customs and rituals** (celebrating festivals according to original hometown traditions, not local ones).  
- **Self-identification** (calling local people “你们本地人” and not identifying as such themselves).  
- **Community formation** (spontaneous clustering of people from the same hometown into a “village” in the city).  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic and cultural practices** as **indicators of whether someone has truly integrated into the local culture**, which they see as the **defining standard** for local identity. The author **rejects** physical or administrative markers (like ancestral homes or villages) as sufficient, and instead emphasizes **cultural assimilation** as the **core logic** for defining localness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** **cultural integration** as the **key standard** for local identity. This includes **language use, customs, and self-identification**, all of which are central to **linguistic and cultural recognition** in the definition of localness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author clearly endorses **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** as the primary standard for defining local identity, using **language, customs, and self-identification** to distinguish between those who are and are not considered local.

The author emphasizes their deep-rooted connection to Guangzhou by highlighting ancestral ties, burial traditions, and language use. They identify as a ""Guangzhou villager"" with generations of ancestors buried on Baiyun Mountain, not in public cemeteries, and emphasize that all family members speak Cantonese without any accent. This reflects a strong claim to being a ""true local"" based on family history, cultural practices, and linguistic purity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""籍贯广州"" (hometown is Guangzhou)**: Indicates ancestral origin and ties to the region.  
- **""广州村民"" (Guangzhou villager)**: Emphasizes rural roots and a generational connection to the area.  
- **""清明去白云山上拜，几代祖先都在山上"" (Go to Baiyun Mountain for Qingming Festival, ancestors have been buried there for generations)**: Demonstrates long-term family settlement and traditional burial customs.  
- **""家庭所有成员粤语完全不带口音"" (All family members speak Cantonese without any accent)**: Indicates linguistic-cultural recognition and purity as a marker of identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational family settlement**, **traditional burial practices**, and **linguistic-cultural purity** as key criteria to assert their identity as a ""true local"" of Guangzhou. These elements collectively serve to distinguish themselves from those with less deep or recent ties to the region.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的，爸爸是潮汕归侨，我广州土生土长我觉得自己只是半个广州人,RL3,"  
The author reflects on their own identity as a ""native of Guangzhou"" but feels they are only a ""half Guangzhou person."" This is due to a mixed background: their mother is from a village in Baiyun District with ancestral roots and a祠堂 (ancestral hall), while their father is a returnee from Chaozhou-Shantou (潮汕归侨). The author uses this personal background to express a sense of partial or conditional local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我广州土生土长"" indicates the author was born and raised in Guangzhou, aligning with RL3 (Family Rootedness/Individual Growth History).  
- ""我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的"" suggests deep ancestral and cultural roots in a local village, also aligning with RL3.  
- ""爸爸是潮汕归侨"" implies an immigrant background, which may affect the author’s sense of local identity.  
- The author’s self-identification as ""only half a Guangzhou person"" reflects a perceived lack of full local identity, likely due to mixed ancestry or non-continuous family settlement in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s reflection on their identity hinges on their family’s settlement history and ancestral ties in Guangzhou. The mention of their mother's ancestral village and祠堂 emphasizes the importance of family roots in defining ""true"" local identity. Meanwhile, the father's immigrant background introduces a contrast, reinforcing the idea that local identity is not just about birthplace but also about generational settlement and cultural continuity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that local identity is tied to generational settlement and ancestral ties within the city (RL3), and their own mixed background leads to a sense of partial belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3, as the author uses their personal generational settlement history and family roots (or lack thereof) as a basis for evaluating their own local identity.

？？？我广州话有乡音，我都系广州人，去祠堂都系讲乡音,RL4,"  
The author asserts their identity as a ""Guangzhou person"" despite speaking with a ""乡音"" (dialect or accent of a specific local subgroup). They emphasize that even in formal or traditional settings like ancestral temples (祠堂), they still use this local dialect. This indicates that the author challenges the idea that one must speak a ""standard"" or ""pure"" form of Cantonese to be considered a ""true"" local, and instead affirms that dialect use is a legitimate part of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我广州话有乡音"" (I speak Cantonese with a local accent): indicates dialect or accent.  
- ""我都系广州人"" (I am a Guangzhou person): asserts local identity.  
- ""去祠堂都系讲乡音"" (Even at the ancestral temple, I speak with the local accent): implies that local dialect is used in traditional or community contexts, reinforcing cultural-linguistic identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the fact that they speak with a local accent (乡音) and still identify as a Guangzhou person to affirm that dialect is part of legitimate local identity. This suggests that linguistic-cultural recognition is not only present but also a marker of authenticity in their view.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of local dialect (乡音) as a valid and accepted part of ""local identity,"" rejecting the notion that only a ""standard"" form of Cantonese is legitimate for being a local.

The author explains that although their family has lived in Guangzhou for several generations and they speak Cantonese, they are not considered a ""native"" (土著) Guangzhou person because they are from Panyu. This reflects a distinction between being a ""local"" and being a ""native,"" based on **historical and regional differentiation** within the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我家也好几代在这边"" (my family has lived here for several generations) → family historical rootedness.  
- ""讲粤语"" (speaks Cantonese) → linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""只说我是广州本地人，但不算广州土著"" (people say I am a local Guangzhou person, but not a native) → a distinction between ""local"" and ""native.""  
- ""因为我是番禺的"" (because I am from Panyu) → regional differentiation based on historical or social perception of Panyu as not fully part of the ""core"" Guangzhou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **generational settlement (RL3)** and **regional differentiation (RL1)** to define the boundaries of ""true"" local identity. The fact that they are from Panyu is the key reason they are not considered ""native"" despite meeting other criteria like long-term residence and language.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **historical settlement (RL3)** and **regional differentiation (RL1)** are key criteria in defining ""native"" local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The author is using the socially accepted boundary between Guangzhou and Panyu to define who is considered a ""native"" and who is not.  
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**: The author mentions their family has lived in the area for several generations, which is a key criterion for being a ""local,"" but not a ""native.""

别纠结了基本不是，民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门。我家没有祠堂，清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来。广州土著大部分都走国外，留下来万中无一，美加香港南洋比广州更多广州土著。,"RL1, RL3","  
The author is making a historical and generational claim about who can be considered a ""true native"" or ""土著"" (indigenous/local person) of Guangzhou. They argue that most original Guangzhou residents migrated abroad, and only a tiny fraction remained. The author also explains their own family background, suggesting that even if their family has lived in Guangzhou for generations, they may not be considered ""true natives"" due to historical migration and absence of ancestral worship (祠堂), which is culturally significant in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门"" refers to a historically sedimented spatial boundary of the old Guangzhou city (RL1).
- ""我家没有祠堂"" (no ancestral hall) relates to family rootedness and lineage (RL3).
- ""清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来"" (family moved out and returned) indicates a migration history and challenges the idea of being a ""true native"" (RL3).
- ""广州土著大部分都走国外，留下来万中无一"" (most original Guangzhou people left the country) implies a generational and historical criterion for being a ""true local"" (RL3).
- The author is implicitly using historical spatial boundaries and family lineage as standards to define who is a ""true native"" of Guangzhou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a definition of ""local identity"" based on both **historical spatial boundaries** (what was considered the ""true"" old Guangzhou) and **family rootedness** (ancestral presence, migration history, and cultural practices like having a祠堂). These elements are used to distinguish between ""true locals"" and those who are not, based on historical and generational continuity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both **historical spatial boundaries** and **family lineage/migration history** as key criteria for defining ""true local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** due to the use of historical spatial boundaries (西门口到大东门) to define the ""true"" core of Guangzhou. It also aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** due to the emphasis on family history, migration, and absence of ancestral halls as markers of ""true local"" status.

The author is questioning whether communities that have **historically lived in Guangzhou**, **retained the local language, cultural practices, and traditional spirit**, and **maintain strong cultural continuity** (despite relocating for various reasons) are **more ""Guangzhou""** than those who now only speak Mandarin, do not eat traditional Cantonese food (like 白切鸡), or listen to Cantonese music. The author also implies that **those who have lost traditional cultural traits** are **no longer truly representative of local identity**, even if they are ethnically or geographically ""native.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Generational continuity** in Guangzhou (世代居住在广州) — RL3.  
- **Retention of language, culture, and dietary habits** (保留广州语言文化饮食习惯传统精神内核) — RL4.  
- **Comparison between ""true"" cultural practitioners"" and ""modern"" locals who have lost these traits** — RL4 and RL3.  
- **Implicit judgment of cultural authenticity as a standard for ""localness""** — RL4.  
- **The author is not endorsing administrative or spatial boundaries**, but **cultural continuity and historical rootedness** as the key to defining who is more ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical rootedness (RL3)** and **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** as the **primary standards** for evaluating who is more authentically ""Guangzhou."" The argument is that **cultural preservation and intergenerational continuity**, rather than mere birthplace or administrative status, define a deeper, more meaningful local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **both RL3 and RL4** as criteria for defining a more authentic or ""true"" local identity. The argument is that **cultural continuity and historical settlement** are more important than mere birth or current residence.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**. The author argues that **those who maintain cultural and linguistic traditions over generations** are more ""Guangzhou"" than those who have lost these traits, regardless of their ethnic or geographic origin.

不算吧，我外公开始来广州工作我妈他们在广州长大的，在家也都是说粤语，基本只有清明才会回老家一两天，他们都不会说自己是广州人。,RL3,"  
The author is clarifying that despite their family having lived in Guangzhou for multiple generations, including being raised there and speaking Cantonese at home, their family does not consider themselves ""Guangzhou people."" This implies that the author is referencing a standard for defining ""local people"" that goes beyond generational presence or linguistic-cultural assimilation, and instead includes a sense of ancestral origin or self-identification.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""My grandfather started working in Guangzhou"" and ""my mother grew up in Guangzhou"" indicate family historical rootedness (RL3).  
- ""Speaking Cantonese at home"" relates to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""They don’t consider themselves Guangzhou people"" suggests a rejection of local identity based on self-identification, possibly due to a perceived ancestral or cultural disconnect from the core ""local"" group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses family historical rootedness (long-term settlement) and linguistic-cultural assimilation (speaking local language at home) as **background conditions** that one might expect to qualify as ""local."" However, the author emphasizes that these **do not necessarily lead to self-identification as local**, implying that **self-identification** or **ancestral origin** may be the more important or overriding factor in defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** linguistic-cultural recognition or family historical rootedness as sufficient for defining local identity in this context. Instead, the **lack of self-identification as ""Guangzhou people""** suggests that **ancestral origin** or **perceived cultural difference** may be the actual standard that the author believes is used to determine local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While RL3 and RL4 are mentioned, they are not endorsed as sufficient criteria for defining local identity in this case. The author instead implies that **ancestral origin** or **self-identification**—which are not directly captured in the RL framework—play a role. However, within the given RL categories, the **explicit rejection of self-identification as local despite long-term settlement and linguistic assimilation** most closely aligns with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** being **insufficient** to define local identity, as the author implies that it is **not enough** on its own.

Output: RL3"

The author is defining who counts as a ""true Guangzhou local"" by emphasizing **long-term family settlement** in specific historical districts (老四区), and explicitly contrasts this with their own identity as a ""Guangzhou Hakka"" who has also lived in the city for multiple generations. The author is using **family rootedness** and **generational settlement** as key criteria to distinguish ""true locals"" from other long-term residents.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老四区世居"" (long-settled in the old four districts) implies a **historical settlement** and **regional rootedness**.
- ""至少五代都在广州土生土长"" (at least five generations born and raised in Guangzhou) is a **clear generational marker** of family settlement.
- ""有分红有地"" (having land and dividend rights) suggests **material and social embeddedness** in the local area.
- The author contrasts their own identity as a ""Guangzhou Hakka"" with the ""true locals"" of the old districts, reinforcing the idea that **family history and lineage** determine ""localness.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **family history of settlement** and **long-term generational presence** as the primary criteria for defining who is a ""true local."" This is used to draw a distinction between those with deep roots in the city (老四区世居) and those who are also long-term residents but from different backgrounds (e.g., Hakka). The mention of land and dividends also reflects **social embeddedness**, but it is framed as a **supporting detail** rather than the primary standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **family historical rootedness** (generational settlement and lineage) as the **primary** and **most important** standard for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects a logic of local identity based on **family historical rootedness**, aligning with **RL3**. The mention of land and dividends could be interpreted as **RL6**, but since they are not the core argument and are not emphasized as a standard for judging ""localness"" in the same way as generational settlement, they are not annotated.

讲白话？,RL4,"  
The phrase ""讲白话？"" (Do you speak plain/clear language?) is a rhetorical or direct question implying that the speaker is questioning whether the other person speaks the local language or uses the local dialect. This is a concise way of referencing linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""讲白话"" (speaking plain/clear language) is a reference to local dialect or language usage.  
- The question form implies a potential exclusion or inclusion based on language.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
This phrase is used to question whether the interlocutor belongs to the local linguistic and cultural group. It serves as a shorthand for evaluating someone’s local identity based on language, a key criterion in RL4.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is using language as a standard to judge whether someone is part of the local group, which is a clear endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition as a defining feature of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4, which is based on using language and cultural speech habits to identify local people.

Output: RL4"
有分红就算,RL6,"  
The author states, ""有分红就算"" (Having dividends counts), implying that the possession of certain economic benefits—specifically, dividends—can be a criterion for being considered part of a local community or as having a legitimate claim to local identity. This is likely in the context of property ownership, community rights, or shared economic interests.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) suggests economic participation or ownership rights, potentially tied to property or community-based assets.
- The phrase implies that having such rights or benefits is sufficient to be considered part of the local group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using economic participation—specifically the receipt of dividends—as a standard to determine inclusion in the local community. This aligns with the idea that being embedded in the local economic structure is a form of legitimacy for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that receiving dividends (which may come from property ownership, community investment, or other local assets) is sufficient to be considered a legitimate part of the local group. This reflects a form of social embeddedness and economic legitimacy in the local context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The reference to ""分红"" (dividends) and its implication as a marker of local legitimacy aligns with RL6, which involves social embeddedness and economic status as criteria for local identity.

Output: RL6"
不会说不算,RL4,"  
The phrase ""不会说不算"" (literally ""if you can't speak it, you don't count"") is a concise statement that implies a judgment criterion: the ability to speak the local language (likely a regional dialect or the local lingua franca) is essential for being considered part of the ""local"" group. The author is expressing that language ability is a gatekeeping factor for inclusion in the local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不会说"" (can't speak) refers to linguistic capability.
- ""不算"" (doesn't count) implies exclusion from the local group.
- The statement reflects a clear boundary based on linguistic-cultural recognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the ability to speak the local language as a standard for determining whether someone is considered part of the local group. This implies that linguistic-cultural recognition is central to the author's logic of defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that linguistic ability is a necessary condition for being considered local.

看年龄，时代不一样，现在00后很多土生土长的广州人也不会粤语,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is commenting on the changing dynamics of local identity in Guangzhou, particularly how younger generations (00后) born and raised in the city may no longer speak Cantonese, despite being ""native"" to the city. This implies a shift in cultural-linguistic recognition and a redefinition of what it means to be a ""local"" in the context of language and generational change.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的广州人"" (born and raised in Guangzhou) refers to **family rootedness** (RL3).  
- ""不会粤语"" (do not speak Cantonese) refers to **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4).  
- The author is pointing out a generational change in **linguistic-cultural recognition**, suggesting that traditional linguistic markers of ""local identity"" are no longer universally upheld.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the lack of Cantonese fluency among younger, locally born residents to highlight how **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) is no longer a reliable or consistent marker of local identity, especially across generations. The mention of being ""土生土长"" reinforces that even those with **family rootedness** (RL3) may not conform to traditional linguistic-cultural criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **implicitly acknowledging** that **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4) is being challenged or weakened in defining local identity, and that **family rootedness** (RL3) alone may not align with traditional cultural expectations (e.g., speaking the local language). This reflects an evolving understanding of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The author references being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally), which is a key element of family rootedness.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**: The author comments on the lack of Cantonese fluency, which directly relates to cultural-linguistic recognition as a boundary marker for local identity.  
- The author is **not explicitly endorsing** either as a standard for defining local identity, but is **highlighting a conflict or shift** in how these two criteria interact in defining local identity.

从小是从什么时候开始？如果80年代生，不会说广州话不太可能。如果00年生，也很正常,RL4,"  
The author is discussing the relationship between birth generation and the ability to speak Cantonese in Guangzhou. The author implies that for people born in the 1980s, not speaking Cantonese is unlikely or unusual, whereas for those born in the 2000s, it is more normal or acceptable. This suggests that the author sees Cantonese language proficiency as a marker of local identity, but with a generational shift in expectations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author links **Cantonese language proficiency** to **birth generation**.
- The author implies a **changing standard** of what counts as ""local"" depending on the era.
- The phrase “不会说广州话不太可能” (not speaking Cantonese is unlikely) suggests a **cultural-linguistic boundary** for local identity.
- The phrase “也很正常” (it’s normal) implies a **softening or shifting** of that boundary for newer generations.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **linguistic-cultural recognition** (Cantonese language) as a standard for defining local identity, but acknowledges that this standard is **changing over time**, especially with generational differences. The author is not rejecting the standard entirely, but is **acknowledging its evolving relevance** in defining who is considered local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the use of **language and cultural familiarity** (Cantonese) as a **key criterion** for defining local identity, even as they acknowledge that this standard is **less rigid for newer generations**. The author is not rejecting the standard, but is commenting on its **historical and generational variations**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a basis for defining local identity, with the author implicitly endorsing it as a standard, albeit one that is **contextualized by generational shifts**. This aligns with **RL4**.

The author reflects on the linguistic transformation of non-local students who gradually became fluent in Cantonese after settling in Guangzhou for a few years. They contrast this with a generational shift in the linguistic identity of local Guangzhou people, who now may not speak Cantonese as authentically or fluently as previous generations. The author also notes that many Australian-born Chinese (ABCs) in Sydney can speak fluent, authentic Cantonese without any detectable accent, while some ""local"" Guangzhou people do not. This implies a concern about the erosion or dilution of the traditional linguistic markers of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author uses **fluent Cantonese proficiency** and **absence of accent** as markers of local identity.  
- The contrast between **non-locals who become fluent** and **locals who do not** suggests a shift in the cultural-linguistic recognition of who qualifies as ""local.""  
- The author emphasizes **generational differences** in the expression of local identity through language.  
- The comparison with **Australian-born Chinese who speak fluent Cantonese** implies that **language fluency and cultural familiarity** are more important than birthplace in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses **linguistic fluency and cultural assimilation** as criteria for defining who is a ""true"" local. The argument is that fluency in the local dialect (Cantonese) and the absence of a detectable accent are key indicators of belonging and local identity, more so than geographic origin or birthplace.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **linguistic fluency and cultural familiarity** as central to defining who is a ""true"" local, especially in contrast to those who may be born locally but do not speak the local language authentically.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author uses **language fluency, accent, and cultural familiarity** as criteria to define and distinguish local identity.

广州出世叫本地人..但系广州某村出世加有分红或有地叫土著.这样比较容易解释,"RL3, RL6","  
The author is explaining a nuanced distinction between different levels of ""local identity"" in Guangzhou. Being born in Guangzhou makes one a ""本地人"" (local person), but being born in a specific village (某村) and having land or dividend rights (分红) makes one a ""土著"" (native/indigenous). The author is emphasizing that **possession of local resources (like land or dividends)** is a key criterion for being considered a ""true"" or ""original"" local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Born in Guangzhou"" (广州出世) is a basic criterion for being a local person.  
- ""Born in a specific village in Guangzhou"" (广州某村出世) introduces a more specific geographical origin.  
- ""Having land or dividends"" (加有分红或有地) refers to material or symbolic resources tied to local embeddedness.  
- The term ""土著"" (native/indigenous) implies a deeper, more established form of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family rootedness** (being born in a specific village) and **social embeddedness** (ownership of land or dividend rights) to define different levels of local identity. The distinction between ""本地人"" and ""土著"" reflects a hierarchy where **possession of local assets** (RL6) and **generational settlement** (RL3) are both used to determine who is more authentically ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both **generational settlement in a specific local area** and **possession of local resources (like land or dividends)** as criteria for defining different levels of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

那你有没分红或者土地阿？,RL6,"  
The author is asking whether the other person has ""dividends or land,"" which directly refers to economic or property-based assets that are often tied to local community membership or rural/urban settlement rights. This implies that such assets are considered indicators of local rootedness or belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) and ""土地"" (land) are both clear indicators of economic or property-based embeddedness in a local area.  
- These assets are often associated with long-term settlement, ownership, or rights within a local community, especially in rural or semi-rural contexts.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The question implies that owning land or receiving dividends is a standard for determining whether someone has a legitimate or deep-rooted connection to the local area. This is used to assess whether the person has the social or economic foundation to be considered a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author refers to ""分红"" (dividends) and ""红本子的楼"" (a house with a red book, i.e., formal property title or ownership certificate), which are typically associated with property ownership and long-term investment. These are used to describe a form of local embeddedness and economic stability, implying that owning such property is a marker of belonging or legitimacy in the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) implies a financial or social return tied to property or community membership.  
- ""屋企有栋有红本子的楼"" (owning a house with a red book) refers to formal property ownership, a key indicator of social embeddedness and economic status in many Chinese cities.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that owning a house with formal property rights (红本子) and receiving dividends are indicators of deep local roots and economic integration into the community. These factors are implicitly used to evaluate or define who is ""established"" or ""genuinely local.""

The author mentions ""有祠堂有分红"" (""has an ancestral hall and receives dividends""), which are concrete indicators of long-term social and economic integration into a local community. These elements imply a deep-rooted connection to the area, including participation in communal institutions and economic benefits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有祠堂"" (has an ancestral hall) reflects participation in traditional social structures and long-standing community ties.  
- ""有分红"" (receives dividends) suggests economic integration and ownership or entitlement within the local community, such as through property or land rights.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence of an ancestral hall and receipt of dividends to indicate a stable and legitimate local identity. These are not just personal advantages but are framed as symbols of belonging and legitimacy within the local social and economic structure.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author clearly distinguishes between ""true locals"" and ""newcomers"" in Guangzhou. According to the author, ""true locals"" are those whose **ancestors have long been settled in Guangzhou** and who have **ancestral halls (祠堂)**, which symbolize deep historical and familial roots. The author considers themselves a ""true local"" from Zengcheng and implies that the interlocutor, despite being newly registered in Guangzhou, is not a ""true local"" because they lack this generational and cultural depth.

是本地人，不是土著，还有些人在那里卜佬卜佬，分红的时候可没见你卜佬,RL6,"  
The author is clearly differentiating between ""本地人"" (local people) and ""土著"" (indigenous/true locals), while also mocking or criticizing a group of people who are described as ""卜佬卜佬"" (a derogatory term for outsiders or newcomers who pretend to be locals). The author further implies that these outsiders do not truly belong to the local community by pointing out that they do not receive ""分红"" (dividends), which could refer to community benefits or rights.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地人"" (local people) vs. ""土著"" (indigenous/true locals) — a distinction in local identity.
- ""卜佬卜佬"" — a term for outsiders pretending to be locals.
- ""分红的时候可没见你卜佬"" — suggests that the outsiders do not have access to local privileges or embedded resources.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the distinction between ""本地人"" and ""土著"" to define a hierarchy within local identity, with ""土著"" representing a more authentic form of local belonging. The mocking of ""卜佬"" outsiders and the reference to ""分红"" (dividends) indicate that **social embeddedness and access to local resources** are key to being recognized as a true local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **long-standing local residents (土著) and those with social embeddedness (e.g., receiving dividends)** are the ""true locals,"" and that **outsiders or newcomers who lack these ties** are not considered genuine members of the local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's use of **social embeddedness** and **access to local privileges (分红)** as criteria for defining who is a ""true local"" aligns with **RL6** (Social Embeddedness). The mention of ""卜佬"" outsiders and the exclusion from community benefits reinforce the symbolic and material criteria of local identity rooted in social and economic integration.

补充一下 是光谷东感觉光谷广场那一块交通也是乱糟的,N/A,"  
The author is commenting on the traffic conditions in the Guanggu area, specifically mentioning that the Guanggu Plaza area is chaotic in terms of transportation. The mention of ""Guanggu East"" and ""Guanggu Plaza"" suggests a comparison or evaluation of different parts of the Guanggu district, but the focus is on describing the **traffic and livability of the area**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通也是乱糟的"" (traffic is also chaotic) refers to the **functionality and convenience of the living environment**, which is a key aspect of **RL5 (Functional Livability)**.  
- The mention of ""Guanggu East"" and ""Guanggu Plaza"" could suggest **regional differentiation**, but there is **no explicit or implicit use of these to define who is or is not ""local""**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **describing the traffic situation as inconvenient**, which may reflect a **personal preference or observation about the area's livability**, but there is **no indication that this is used as a standard to define local identity** or to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local"" people. The author is not using the quality of transportation to determine who belongs or who is considered a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not endorsing or using the traffic conditions as a standard for defining local identity**. The statement is **a factual or evaluative comment on infrastructure**, not a criterion for judging who is local or what constitutes a ""local"" area in terms of identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text mentions **functional livability (RL5)** features like traffic, **there is no indication that these are being used as a basis for defining local identity**. The author is not drawing boundaries or making identity claims based on this.

The author is defending a traditional, socially habitual way of referring to the three towns (汉口、武昌、汉阳) in Wuhan, emphasizing that these are not administrative divisions but geographical-cultural concepts. The author argues that while there are many administrative districts (e.g., 江汉、江岸、硚口), the older, more accepted way of defining the city's local identity is through the three towns, which reflect a long-standing spatial and cultural understanding among ""old Wuhan people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author explicitly references the traditional geographical division of Wuhan into three towns (汉口、武昌、汉阳).
- The author contrasts this with administrative divisions, which are more modern and formal.
- The author validates the older, habitual way of defining local spatial identity as more legitimate or authentic among ""old Wuhan people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the traditional geographical division (三镇) as a standard to define what constitutes a ""local"" or ""authentic"" part of Wuhan. This reflects a deep-rooted, shared understanding of the city's spatial identity, which is not based on administrative boundaries but on historical and cultural consensus.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the traditional, socially habitual spatial understanding (三镇) as the legitimate way to define local identity in Wuhan, and explicitly contrasts it with administrative divisions.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a shared, historically sedimented local perception of spatial categories (三镇) used to define ""local"" identity, distinct from administrative boundaries.

住光谷的不敢讲话鄙视链底层,RL6,"  
The author is referring to people living in the Guanggu area (""住光谷的"") who are at the ""bottom of the鄙视链"" (鄙视链 means ""disparagement chain"" or ""hierarchy of disdain"") and ""dare not speak up."" This implies a social hierarchy or symbolic ranking in which certain groups are looked down upon, possibly due to their location, economic status, or cultural capital.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住光谷的"" (residents of Guanggu) refers to a specific geographic location, which may be tied to a sense of local identity.  
- ""不敢讲话"" (dare not speak) suggests social embeddedness or lack of influence.  
- ""鄙视链底层"" (bottom of the disparagement chain) implies a symbolic ranking based on perceived status, potentially tied to location, economic background, or social capital.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is commenting on a social hierarchy in which residents of Guanggu are at the bottom, possibly due to factors like location, economic status, or lack of social influence. This reflects a symbolic ranking based on spatial and social embeddedness, which is used to judge or define who is considered a ""true local"" or who holds higher status in the local social order.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implies that being a resident of Guanggu and being at the bottom of the disparagement chain is a status-related issue tied to social embeddedness and symbolic ranking, suggesting that location and social influence are used to define local identity and status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as it reflects a symbolic ranking of local identity based on spatial location and perceived social influence. The author suggests that being in a certain area (Guanggu) correlates with being at the bottom of a social hierarchy, implying that social embeddedness and economic or symbolic status are used to define local identity and its quality.

我经常因为我的青普被当成外码,RL4,"  
The author is expressing that they are often mistaken for an outsider (""外码"") due to their accent or dialect (""青普""), which suggests that linguistic or cultural markers are being used to judge whether someone is ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""青普"" (Qingpu dialect/accent) is a regional linguistic feature.  
- ""被当成外码"" (mistaken for an outsider) indicates that linguistic differences are used to distinguish between ""local"" and ""non-local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly showing that their regional speech is not recognized as ""local"" by others, and this leads to them being labeled as an outsider. This reflects the use of linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly defining who is ""local,"" but they are showing that linguistic differences (in this case, the Qingpu dialect) are used by others (and possibly by the author's own logic) to make such distinctions. This is a clear implication of RL4.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The use of dialect as a marker for distinguishing ""local"" from ""non-local"" aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.

The author describes a deeply rooted perception among native Wuhan residents, particularly those living in the core area of Hankou (e.g., Liudaoqiao, Youyi Road, QuShui Building, Jianghan Road), that areas outside the inner ring (e.g., Huangpu Road) are not considered part of the ""true"" city center. This reflects a **socially conventional and emotionally significant spatial boundary** that defines who is ""truly local"" and which areas are ""real"" urban centers.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to specific inner-city areas (Liudaoqiao, Jianghan Road, Minzhuo Lane) as the ""true"" city center.  
- Use of spatial demarcation (""inner ring"", ""outside the inner ring"", ""village"") to distinguish between core urban areas and peripheries.  
- The phrase ""in their hearts"" (""在他们心里"") emphasizes the **subjective, habitual, and socially sedimented perception** of local identity and spatial belonging.  
- The contrast between ""real urban center"" and ""suburbs"" is used to **define who is a ""true Wuhan person""**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting how **socially conventional and emotionally embedded spatial cognition** is used by long-term residents of the Hankou core to **exclude areas outside the inner ring from the ""true"" city** and thus implicitly define who qualifies as a ""real Wuhan person"". This is not about administrative boundaries or personal experience, but about **shared historical and cultural perceptions of urban space**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is explicitly endorsing the idea that **long-standing, shared spatial perceptions**—especially the distinction between the ""inner core"" and the ""periphery""—are **used to define local identity** and the legitimacy of urban belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author reflects on their experience growing up in Wuhan as a person from Caidian, a district with a distinct local dialect and identity. They describe how the ""old Wuhan natives"" (老武汉的土著) exhibited a sense of superiority, especially through linguistic and cultural exclusion (e.g., speaking Caidian dialect in the city center and being looked down upon). The author internalized this social hierarchy, feeling inferior, but has since grown to reject such biases. The text explores how **linguistic and cultural identity**, as well as **long-term settlement and generational rootedness**, are used to construct and enforce a local identity hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""老武汉的土著""** and **""乡里人""** imply a contrast between ""true locals"" (老土著) and ""outsiders"" or ""non-core locals"" (乡里人), which relates to **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** and **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- **""说蔡甸话""** (speaking Caidian dialect) is a **linguistic marker** used to distinguish locals from non-locals or to signal one’s own identity, aligning with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**.  
- The author reflects on how **""越是穷的老土著越是优越感强""**, suggesting that **long-term settlement and generational roots** are tied to a sense of legitimacy in local identity, which relates to **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- The shift in the author’s attitude—from internalizing inferiority to rejecting it—suggests that **linguistic and cultural identity** is still used by others to judge local belonging, even if the author no longer cares, reinforcing **RL4**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's experience is framed around how **linguistic identity (RL4)** and **generational settlement (RL3)** are used to define and enforce local identity boundaries. The ""old Wuhan natives"" use **Caidian dialect** and **generational rootedness** to assert superiority, while the author internalizes and later rejects these standards. The author also implies that **long-term settlement and generational ties** are still used by some to claim a more ""authentic"" local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** the idea that long-term settlement or dialect should define local identity (as they reject this after growing up).  
- However, the author **explicitly describes how others use these criteria** (e.g., dialect, generational roots) to define who is a ""true local,"" and how such criteria were used to exclude or look down on others.  
- This is **not a case of the author endorsing** these criteria, but rather **describing how they were used by others**, and how they were internalized by the author in the past.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The **dialect-based exclusion** and **linguistic identity as a boundary marker** clearly align with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**.  
- The **generational rootedness** and **""old Wuhan natives""** as a group with perceived legitimacy in local identity align with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- However, since the author **does not explicitly endorse** these criteria in the present and is **reflecting on their internalization and rejection**, only the **criteria that are explicitly used by others and described by the author** are annotated.  
- The author **does not use these criteria to define local identity** themselves in the present, but **describes how others do**, which still falls under the scope of the task if the author **explicitly conveys** how such criteria are used by others in defining local identity.

The author is defending the identity of **Huangpi** as a legitimate part of **Wuhan**, arguing that despite its current geographical distance, it is officially part of the city and thus should be treated as a ""true"" local area. The author emphasizes **administrative belonging** and **future integration** (via the subway line) to justify the local identity of Huangpi. The author also notes that they are not personally met with discrimination when identifying as a Huangpi person, implying that **local identity is increasingly accepted or normalized**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""Huangpi is now part of Wuhan""** – clearly refers to **administrative legitimacy**.
- **""One mother, different advantages""** – implies a **shared administrative or cultural origin**, suggesting a **collective identity**.
- **""Subway Line 7 will be extended to Huangpi""** – points to **functional livability** (improved accessibility and convenience).
- **""No one looks down on or is surprised when I say I’m from Huangpi""** – suggests that **local identity is not necessarily defined by social exclusion** and is increasingly accepted, but this is more a **personal observation** than a standard used to define ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The **administrative legitimacy** (Huangpi is part of Wuhan) is the **main argument** the author uses to defend the legitimacy of Huangpi as a local area.
- The **subway extension** is used to support the **idea that Huangpi is becoming more integrated and livable**, thus **enhancing its status as a desirable or legitimate local area**.
- The author **does not use** personal experience of being accepted as a criterion to define local identity, but rather as a **reassurance** or **counterpoint** to potential stigma.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **explicitly endorses** **administrative legitimacy** as a **key standard** for defining local identity (i.e., if it is part of Wuhan, it is a local area).
- The author **also implicitly endorses** **functional livability** as a **supporting criterion** that enhances the desirability and legitimacy of Huangpi as a local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is clearly endorsed as the **primary criterion** for defining local identity.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability)** is also used, though in a **supporting role**, to argue that Huangpi is becoming a more integrated and desirable local area.

我新洲的，基本不认为自己是武汉人，感觉武汉人也不太看得起我们，我平时都是说行政区划上算武汉人,RL1,"  
The author explicitly expresses a sense of identity rooted in the **Newzhou** area and **does not identify strongly with the broader ""Wuhan people"" label**. They feel a sense of exclusion from the central Wuhan identity and believe that central Wuhan people look down on them. As a compromise, they only acknowledge their status as ""Wuhan people"" in the **administrative sense**, not culturally or socially.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Newzhou people""** as a distinct regional identity.  
- **""Do not consider themselves Wuhan people""** implies a **self-defined identity boundary** based on **regional perception**.  
- **""Wuhan people don't look up to us""** suggests a **perceived social hierarchy** and **cultural boundary**.  
- **""Administratively considered Wuhan people""** indicates an **administrative legitimacy** boundary is acknowledged, but not as a core identity marker.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **regional perception** (Newzhou is not truly Wuhan) to define a **cultural and social distinction** in local identity. They also reference **administrative legitimacy**, but **reject it as a meaningful identity marker**, instead emphasizing **social habit and regional perception** as the basis for defining who is a ""real"" Wuhan person.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **strongly endorses** the **regional perception-based boundary** (RL1) as the core standard for local identity.  
- They **acknowledge administrative legitimacy** (RL2), but **do not endorse it as a defining criterion**—it is merely a technical classification.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's argument is centered on **regional perception and social habit** as the basis for distinguishing between ""real Wuhan people"" and those from peripheral areas like Newzhou. This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**. The mention of administrative status is acknowledged but not endorsed as a defining criterion for local identity.

The author reflects on the historical and cultural definitions of local areas in Wuhan, particularly the Han Kou region, through a traditional saying: “上有古田，下有肉联” (literally, “Upstream is Gutan, downstream is Rourlian”—with Rourlian being the old name for Dijiao). The author also contrasts their own experience of living in Gutan (a core area they consider convenient and developed) with their more casual visits to Dijiao, and expresses a wish for both areas to develop well. This reflects the author’s use of **historical and cultural regional definitions** to understand and differentiate local areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase “上有古田，下有肉联” is a **historical and culturally sedimented way of defining the spatial hierarchy** of the Han Kou region, reflecting a **shared local perception** of the area’s internal structure.  
- The author **contrasts Gutan and Dijiao**, implying different levels of centrality or development.  
- The author **highlights Gutan’s convenience and development**, including modern facilities like IKEA and Sam’s Club, but **does not use this as a standard for defining who is local**—rather, it is a description of the area's current state.  
- The author **does not reject** the historical saying but instead **uses it as a reference point**, suggesting its continued relevance in defining local spatial identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The historical phrase is used to **establish a shared cultural understanding** of the region’s spatial hierarchy, which the author **implicitly endorses** as part of the local identity framework. The contrast between Gutan and Dijiao is framed through this historical lens, and the author’s own attachment to Gutan (as a place they live in and consider convenient) reinforces the idea that **regional spatial perception is central to local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **uses and implicitly endorses the historical spatial perception** (e.g., the phrase “上有古田，下有肉联”) to understand and differentiate local areas. This is not just a description of physical geography but reflects a **shared cultural logic** for defining the local spatial order.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a **shared, historically sedimented perception of intra-city spatial categories** that the author uses to define the local spatial hierarchy and differentiate areas in terms of their cultural and symbolic status.

武汉已经越来越大了，现在黄陂新洲都划进来了,RL2,"  
The author notes the expansion of Wuhan's administrative boundaries, mentioning that areas like Huangpi and Xinzhou have now been incorporated into Wuhan. This reflects a shift in administrative designation and implies that such changes may affect how people define ""local identity"" in relation to administrative belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""划进来"" (incorporated) is a clear administrative boundary marker.
- The mention of Huangpi and Xinzhou being newly included in Wuhan implies a change in administrative jurisdiction, which may influence how people identify with or are identified as ""local"" to Wuhan.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's statement about administrative redistricting suggests that the inclusion of these areas into Wuhan could influence how residents of these areas are perceived in terms of local identity, and possibly how the speaker themselves or others evaluate who qualifies as a ""Wuhan person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly acknowledges the relevance of administrative boundaries in defining local identity, particularly in the context of urban expansion and redistricting.

The author recalls childhood experiences where their family's employment at Wugang (a state-owned steel company) was seen as a stable and prestigious ""iron rice bowl"" (铁饭碗), yet they were simultaneously mocked as ""乡里伢"" (rural kid, outsider from the countryside). This reveals a **tension between occupational status and social identity**, where **occupational prestige** (being part of a state enterprise) is contrasted with **perceived rural outsider status**, indicating how **occupational type** is used to define or distinguish local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""家里人是武钢的"" (family works at Wugang) — indicates an occupational identity tied to a state enterprise.  
- ""铁饭碗"" (iron rice bowl) — a symbol of stable, prestigious employment.  
- ""乡里伢"" (rural kid) — a derogatory term implying outsider or lower status in urban social hierarchies.  
- The **contrast** between being seen as having a prestigious job and being mocked as a rural outsider suggests **occupational symbolism** plays a role in defining local identity and social hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author reflects on how **occupational background** (working at a state enterprise) was associated with **symbolic prestige**, yet **individual identity** (being labeled a ""乡里伢"") was still used to **exclude or marginalize** them from a full ""local"" or urban identity. This shows that **occupational type** is used as a **symbolic marker** to differentiate between ""locals"" and ""outsiders"" or to define social status within a local context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts the **relevance of occupational type** (state enterprise vs. rural background) in defining social status and local identity. The mocking of ""乡里伢"" implies that **occupational prestige** is tied to **local legitimacy**, and the author is reflecting on how this dynamic affected their own identity perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL7: Occupational Typification**, as it shows how **occupational background** (state enterprise worker vs. rural migrant) is used to **define or distinguish local identity** and social status. The author's experience reflects how **occupational symbolism** is embedded in local identity definitions.

The author expresses a sense of identity rooted in being a ""老武汉人"" (old Wuhan person) and emphasizes that their family has been born and raised in Qingshan District. They also mention that many people from Hankou still consider them outsiders or people from a ""remote area."" This reflects a long-standing regional perception of what constitutes ""authentic"" Wuhan identity, based on historical and geographical distinctions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老武汉人"" (old Wuhan person) implies a generational and historical rootedness in the area.  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) is a clear marker of family historical rootedness.  
- ""乡里"" (countryside or remote area) and ""偏僻地方"" (remote place) suggest a vernacular spatial perception of what is or is not considered central or authentic Wuhan.  
- The author mentions that ""周边的不算正宗武汉人"" (those from surrounding areas are not considered authentic Wuhan people), which reflects a regional boundary and social perception of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses generational and historical rootedness (being born and raised in Qingshan) to claim local identity. At the same time, they acknowledge and reflect on the broader social perception that areas like Qingshan are not considered ""authentic"" Wuhan, which is based on long-standing regional distinctions and social habit. This reflects a tension between personal identity and shared spatial perception.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses both family historical rootedness (RL3) as a personal claim to local identity and vernacular spatial authority (RL1) as a broader social perception that influences how local identity is judged.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with both **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority), due to the implied social consensus about what constitutes ""authentic"" Wuhan, and **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness), as the author emphasizes their generational ties to the area.

The author is asserting that in Wuhan's urban core, **local identity is defined by accent**, specifically by whether someone speaks the **authentic Hankou dialect**. Those who do not are labeled as ""乡里"" (rural or outsiders), and the author points out that the **Huangpi accent differs from standard Wuhan speech**, reinforcing the idea that **accent is a key marker of localness**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""武汉主城区是口音辨别的"" (local identity in Wuhan urban core is distinguished by accent)  
- ""只要不是地道汉口话才说是乡里的"" (if it's not authentic Hankou speech, it's considered rural/outside)  
- ""黄陂的发音跟武汉人是不一样"" (Huangpi pronunciation is different from Wuhan speech)  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly uses **linguistic features (accent)** as the **primary standard for distinguishing between ""local"" Wuhan people and outsiders**. The statement implies that **not speaking the local dialect** is a **symbolic boundary** that excludes someone from being considered a ""true"" local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","RL5, RL6","  
The author provides a detailed comparison of different districts in Wuhan, focusing on their economic performance (GDP), population, housing prices, and development potential. The text aims to explain how different districts vary in terms of wealth, livability, and attractiveness, particularly for young people and migrants. The author emphasizes that **economic development and industrial structure** are key factors in determining the **attractiveness and competitiveness of a local area**, which in turn influences **who is likely to reside there** and **who is considered part of the ""local"" core**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Economic indicators (GDP, income, number of new businesses, patents)** are used to evaluate the development level and attractiveness of districts.
- **Housing prices and housing conditions** are mentioned as indicators of a district's value and desirability.
- **Industrial structure (e.g., high-tech industries in East Lake High-tech Zone)** is highlighted as a key factor in attracting talent and investment.
- **Population dynamics (e.g., young people, migrants)** are described in relation to the development of a district.
- **Comparison between rich and poor districts** is made, implying a hierarchy in local identity and area value.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **economic performance, industrial development, and housing conditions** to **evaluate and rank districts**, implying that **only those who live in well-developed, high-income, and attractive districts** (like East Lake High-tech Zone) are likely to be considered **""true"" or ""desirable"" locals**, especially in the context of **modern urban life and economic mobility**. This reflects a **functional livability and social embeddedness** logic for defining the quality and scope of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **economic development, industrial strength, housing conditions, and population dynamics** as **key standards for evaluating the value and competitiveness of a local area**, which in turn influence **who is considered to be part of the local core or desirable local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- The author uses **economic development and industrial structure** to define the **quality of a local area**, aligning with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**.
- The author emphasizes **property value and housing conditions** as **indicators of local desirability**, also fitting **RL5**.
- The author links **economic status and social embeddedness** (e.g., presence of high-income professionals, young migrants, and new businesses) to **area competitiveness and local identity**, aligning with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**.

@🔥 @cwntry 想到xyl说土生土长的水果湖人,RL3,"  
The author refers to ""土生土长的水果湖人"" (literally: ""locally born and raised Lakers of fruit""), a metaphorical or humorous expression likely referencing someone who has grown up in a specific place (e.g., the Los Angeles Lakers fanbase or a local culture), and uses the phrase ""土生土长"" (""born and raised here"") to describe a deep-rooted local identity. The mention of this phrase is likely used to imply a genuine or authentic local connection.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The key phrase ""土生土长"" directly relates to **individual growth history** and **family settlement depth**, which are central to the definition of RL3.
- The author's use of this phrase suggests an implicit endorsement of long-term settlement and upbringing in a place as a criterion for being ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase ""土生土长"" is used to highlight a person's **authentic local identity**, based on having grown up in the area. This supports the idea that **long-term personal settlement and upbringing** are key to being considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in the area) is a defining feature of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The use of ""土生土长"" to describe someone with a genuine local identity aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness (家族历史根基/个体成长史)**, which emphasizes generational settlement and personal upbringing as criteria for local identity.

gdp 再高，跟汉南人有关系？,RL1,"  
The author questions the relevance of GDP to ""汉南 people,"" suggesting that economic indicators like GDP may not be meaningful or directly related to the identity or experiences of people from Han Nan. This implies that the author is emphasizing a **regional or cultural identity** that is distinct from broader economic metrics, possibly implying that Han Nan is not considered a core or central part of the city in terms of economic influence or integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""汉南人"" (Han Nan people) implies a specific regional identity.
- The rhetorical question ""跟汉南人有关系？"" (What does it have to do with Han Nan people?) implies a **cultural or spatial boundary**, suggesting that Han Nan is perceived as a distinct or peripheral area.
- The focus is on **regional belonging** and the **exclusion of Han Nan from the economic core**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implying that Han Nan is a **distinct region** whose people are not considered part of the core city in terms of economic or administrative integration. The rhetorical question highlights a **shared perception** that Han Nan is separate from the economic mainstream, which supports the idea of **regional identity boundaries**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is implicitly endorsing the idea that **regional identity** is shaped by **historical or cultural distinctions**, particularly the perception that Han Nan is not part of the central urban area or economic core. This aligns with the idea of **socially shared spatial cognition**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a **shared perception** that Han Nan is a distinct area with a different identity from the core city, and the author is questioning the relevance of GDP to Han Nan people, implying a **cultural or spatial boundary**.

是老市民的心理落差……祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人， 混了几辈人还没到大城市上层，眼看这些祖辈都在乡下耕田的外地人来大武汉跟自己平起平坐，甚至混得比自己还好，失落……唯有排外能强挽一下老市民的尊严,"RL3, RL6, RL7","  
The author describes a sense of psychological loss among ""old citizens"" of Wuhan. These individuals see themselves as long-settled residents of the city (""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人""), but feel that despite generations of effort, they have not reached the upper echelons of the city. In contrast, they observe ""outsiders"" (people whose ancestors worked in the countryside) coming to Wuhan and achieving social standing equal to, or even higher than, their own. This perceived threat to social status is met with a defensive, exclusionary attitude—xenophobia—framed as a way to preserve the dignity of the ""old citizens.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" (generations of Wuhan citizens) implies **family rootedness** and **historical settlement**—a strong RL3 element.  
- The contrast between ""old citizens"" and ""outsiders from the countryside"" implies **occupational and social status differentiation**—this is a RL7 element.  
- The emotional and symbolic reaction to outsiders ""平起平坐"" or ""混得比自己还好"" (being equal or better off) reflects **social embeddedness and symbolic hierarchy**—this is a RL6 element.  
- The author does **not** mention administrative boundaries, language, or spatial perception, so RL2, RL4, and RL1 are not relevant here.  
- Although the text discusses the quality of life and social standing, it is **not used as a standard to define who is ""local""** but rather to **explain the emotional reaction** of the ""old citizens""—so RL5 is **not applicable**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational settlement (RL3)** to define the ""true"" local identity of Wuhan. This is contrasted with **outsiders** whose **occupational background (RL7)** (as farmers from the countryside) is seen as inferior. The perceived social mobility of these outsiders triggers a **defensive reaction (RL6)** among the old citizens, who feel their embeddedness and symbolic status are under threat.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the following as criteria for defining ""local identity"" or differentiating between locals and outsiders:
- **Generational settlement in the city (RL3)**: ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" is used to define the ""old citizen"" as the ""true"" local.  
- **Occupational background and social status (RL7)**: The contrast between ""farmers from the countryside"" and the old citizens' status is used to symbolically demarcate local identity.  
- **Social embeddedness and symbolic hierarchy (RL6)**: The author describes the old citizens’ sense of dignity and their reaction to outsiders, which reflects how **social embeddedness and economic or symbolic position** are used to define and defend local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects **three RL categories**:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The author defines the ""old citizens"" as those whose families have lived in Wuhan for generations.  
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification)**: The author contrasts the ""old citizens"" with ""outsiders from the countryside"" who are described as former farmers, implying a symbolic occupational hierarchy.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**: The author describes how the old citizens’ sense of dignity and social embeddedness is challenged by the presence and success of these outsiders, implying that **social and economic rootedness** are key to local identity.

经开合并进去了，我前几年就是住的经开，档案上填的就是这个，后来变成汉南了，搞得我很懵啊,RL2,"  
The author is expressing confusion over a recent administrative boundary change where the area they previously lived in (""经开"") has been officially incorporated into or renamed ""汉南"". They mention that they previously identified and recorded their address as ""经开"", but now it is considered part of ""汉南"", which has caused them disorientation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""经开合并进去了"" indicates an administrative redistricting or merger.  
- ""档案上填的就是这个"" shows the author previously used the old administrative label to define their local identity.  
- ""后来变成汉南了"" implies a shift in administrative legitimacy and local identity markers.  
- The confusion (""搞得我很懵啊"") reflects the author's sensitivity to how administrative divisions affect their perception of ""being local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the shift in administrative classification as a key point of confusion regarding their local identity. They previously identified with the old administrative area (""经开"") and now feel disoriented due to the new official label (""汉南""). This shows that the author implicitly accepts administrative legitimacy as a key criterion for defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly relies on administrative classification to define where they ""belong"" and expresses confusion when this classification changes. This shows that the author endorses administrative legitimacy as a standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL2, as it reflects the author's use of administrative legitimacy (official redistricting and name changes) as a standard for defining local identity.

我土生土长的武汉人，说实话20年前我觉得汉口是武汉最富裕的地方，现在光谷发展的太快了太好了，很多住市区的人跑这边来上班，武汉未来还是看光谷。,"RL1, RL3","  
The author identifies as a **""土生土长的武汉人""** (born and raised in Wuhan), and reflects on how their perception of the most prosperous area in Wuhan has changed over time—from **Hankou** to **Guanggu**. The author now sees Guanggu as the most promising and developed area for the future of Wuhan. This reflects a **changing perception of which areas are ""truly local"" or representative of the city's core** in terms of development and centrality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长的武汉人""** directly relates to **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as it emphasizes generational settlement and lifelong connection to the city.  
- The **author’s shift in perception** from Hankou to Guanggu as the center of prosperity reflects a **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, where the author implicitly adopts a socially accepted or evolving view of what constitutes the ""core"" or ""real"" Wuhan.  
- The author’s **evaluation of Guanggu as the future of Wuhan** and its increasing centrality in people’s work and life also implies a **spatial hierarchy**, which is a key aspect of **RL1**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The **self-identification as a ""born and raised Wuhan person""** (RL3) is used to **establish the author’s legitimacy** in commenting on local spatial perceptions.  
- The **shift in the author’s perception of the city's core** from Hankou to Guanggu is an example of **changing vernacular spatial cognition** (RL1), where the author adopts a new consensus or trend in defining what constitutes the ""real"" or ""main"" Wuhan.  
- The **author's belief in Guanggu's future potential** is based on **spatial development and centrality**, reinforcing the **evolving symbolic value of areas** in defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly identifies as a long-term local resident** (RL3).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3** is clearly present due to the explicit use of ""土生土长"" to define the author’s own local identity.  
- **RL1** is also present, as the author reflects on **how the socially accepted definition of the ""core"" of Wuhan has shifted over time**, using this as a basis for evaluating local identity and spatial value.

黄陂比新洲强多了，机场也在黄陂，人家物流商品市场，文旅游做得火爆。还有两条地铁线路。把阳逻剁有了，新洲只剩下在哪遥远偏僻的小山村啦,RL5,"  
The author is making a strong comparison between Huangpi and Xinzhou, asserting that Huangpi is clearly superior due to its possession of the airport, logistics and commodity markets, tourism development, and two metro lines. In contrast, the author implies that Xinzhou is being left behind, especially with the development of Yangluo being ""cut off"" (剁有了), and Xinzhou is now reduced to a remote and obscure small village. This reflects the author's use of **spatial development and functional infrastructure** as a standard to define the **hierarchy of ""local"" areas**, with Huangpi being the ""real local"" center and Xinzhou being marginalized.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical and infrastructural references**: Airport, logistics/commodity market, tourism, metro lines.  
- **Spatial comparison and hierarchy**: Huangpi is superior, Xinzhou is remote and insignificant.  
- **Functional livability and development level** is used as a key criterion to distinguish between ""real"" and ""less local"" areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **infrastructure and development level** as the **core standard** to evaluate the quality and legitimacy of a ""local"" area. Huangpi is presented as a developed, central, and desirable ""local"" area, while Xinzhou is portrayed as a declining or peripheral one. This reflects a **ranking logic** based on **functional livability and spatial development**, which is used to define what constitutes a ""true local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **functional livability and development level** (e.g., infrastructure, accessibility, economic activity) are the **key criteria** for judging the **value and authenticity** of a ""local"" area. This is used to define which areas are truly ""local"" and which are not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s argument is grounded in **RL5: Functional Livability**, where the presence of infrastructure (airport, metro, logistics, tourism) is used to evaluate and rank the quality and legitimacy of a local area. This directly informs the author's perception of what constitutes a ""real"" or ""true"" local area versus a peripheral one.

最早划分行政区的确是这样的。除了最早的中山路开元，其他的都叫做“郊区”，是行政意义上的郊区。,RL2,"  
The author is discussing the historical administrative division of a city, stating that originally only the central area (e.g., Zhongshan Road, Kaiyuan) was considered the core urban area, while all other areas were officially designated as ""suburbs"" under administrative definitions. This reflects a perspective that administrative boundaries were used to distinguish between core urban and peripheral areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Administrative division"" (行政区划) is a key phrase indicating an official, legal definition of spatial belonging.  
- ""Originally divided like this"" (最早划分行政区的确是这样的) shows the author is referring to a historical administrative boundary.  
- ""Suburbs"" (郊区) is used in the administrative sense, not as a colloquial or cultural term.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that the original definition of urban and suburban areas was based on administrative jurisdiction, and that this administrative framework was the basis for determining which areas were considered part of the city and which were not. This implies that administrative legitimacy is a key criterion for defining local identity in terms of spatial belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly acknowledges that administrative boundaries were used to define urban and suburban areas, and this is presented as a factual, historical standard. The author does not resist or criticize this standard but rather accepts it as the original logic.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as it uses administrative jurisdiction and official definitions to distinguish between core urban and peripheral areas, which serves as a basis for defining local identity in terms of spatial inclusion or exclusion.

The author is discussing the changing administrative and historical boundaries of Xiamen. They argue that while Haicang, Jimei, and Tong'an are now administratively part of Xiamen, historically, Xiamen belonged to these areas, and thus these areas did not ""belong"" to Xiamen in the past. The author also implies that Xiamen traditionally refers to the old city area around Zhongshan Road, where the city historically existed. Furthermore, the author states that for Xiamen locals, Xiang'an is considered part of Tong'an, reinforcing a shared regional identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Historically Xiamen belonged to them, they did not belong to Xiamen"" indicates a historical shift in regional identity perception.  
- ""Xiamen traditionally refers to the old city area around Zhongshan Road"" defines a core area that is historically and culturally central to Xiamen identity.  
- ""Xiamen locals consider Xiang'an part of Tong'an"" suggests a socially accepted regional boundary or identity within the broader Xiamen region.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a definition of ""local Xiamen people"" based on historical and socially accepted regional boundaries. The traditional core area (Zhongshan Road) is contrasted with newly incorporated areas (Haicang, Jimei, Tong'an), which are now administratively part of Xiamen but historically and culturally perceived differently. This reflects a strong sense of **socially conventional spatial cognition** about what constitutes the ""true"" or ""original"" Xiamen.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that historical and socially accepted spatial boundaries (e.g., the old city area, the historical relation of Haicang/Jimei/Tong'an to Xiamen) are key to defining what is or is not ""Xiamen"" and by extension, who qualifies as a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a strong reliance on **historically sedimented and socially conventional spatial cognition** to define local identity. The author is using **regional historical labels and collective emotional maps** to demarcate the boundaries of what counts as ""local Xiamen"" and who can be considered a ""true local."" This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

The author is explaining the historical development of Xiamen's administrative boundaries, particularly how the Special Economic Zone expanded from a small part of Huli to the entire island, and later incorporated areas like Jimei, Haicang, Tong'an, and Xiang'an into the city of Xiamen. The author also emphasizes that people from Jimei and Tong'an have long-standing identities (e.g., ""Jimei people"", ""Guankou people"") and that it is incorrect to claim they are not ""Xiamen people"" due to their historical names or current administrative status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Economic Special Zone expanded to the whole island"" and ""Jimei, Haicang, Tong'an, Xiang'an were incorporated into Xiamen"" — this relates to **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).
- The author refutes the idea that Jimei or Tong'an are not ""Xiamen"" by emphasizing that they **have always had their own names and identities**, indicating a **long-standing social habit of regional cognition** (RL1).
- The author argues against the notion that people from Jimei or Tong'an are not ""real Xiamen people"", implicitly rejecting the idea that only certain areas within Xiamen (e.g., the island) count as the ""true"" local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is countering a claim that Jimei or Tong'an are not ""real Xiamen"" by emphasizing both **historical administrative changes** (RL2) and **long-standing regional identity** (RL1). The author is using **administrative legitimacy** to show that these areas are now part of Xiamen, and **vernacular spatial authority** to argue that their identities as ""Jimei people"" or ""Tong'an people"" are legitimate and historically rooted.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **administrative legitimacy** as a valid standard for defining who is ""local"" (i.e., Jimei and Tong'an are now part of Xiamen). The author also implicitly endorses **vernacular spatial authority**, as they argue that these areas have long-standing identities and should not be dismissed as ""not Xiamen"" simply because they were historically separate or had different names.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses both **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and **vernacular spatial authority (RL1)** to define and defend the legitimacy of Jimei and Tong'an as parts of Xiamen and their people as ""Xiamen people.""

The author expresses surprise at the high housing prices in Xiamen Island, comparing them to Shanghai. The text reflects a personal observation or evaluation of housing prices but does **not** indicate that the author uses this as a standard to define who is or is not ""local"" or to judge the ""localness"" of a place in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of housing prices in Xiamen Island.  
- Comparison with Shanghai.  
- Surprise and personal opinion about the cost of living.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is commenting on the **economic aspect of housing**, not on how housing prices relate to local identity. There is **no indication** that the author believes housing prices are a standard for determining who qualifies as a ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local area"" in terms of identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** use housing prices as a standard to define local identity. The statement is a personal observation and does not imply a judgment about who is or is not local based on this factor.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does not meet the criteria for any RL category, as it does **not** define or evaluate ""local identity"" through any of the outlined logic types. It is a general commentary on housing prices, not on local identity.

The author reflects on how their perception of ""Xiamen"" has changed over time. In childhood, they only considered a specific core area as ""Xiamen,"" while areas outside that (i.e., ""island exterior"") were not regarded as part of the local identity. However, with the expansion of resources and development, the definition of ""Xiamen"" has broadened to include more areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Only this area we understood as Xiamen"" indicates a **historically sedimented spatial perception** of what constitutes the ""local"" area.  
- ""Other we called the outside of the island"" implies **regional identity boundaries** and **cognitive differences** between ""Xiamen"" and ""non-Xiamen.""  
- ""With the expansion of resources, the understanding of Xiamen has become broader"" suggests **changing social consensus** about the spatial scope of the local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the shift in spatial perception of Xiamen to illustrate how the **definition of ""local"" is not fixed**, but historically and socially constructed. The **initial spatial boundary** and the **change in spatial cognition** both serve as criteria for defining ""local identity"" and its evolution.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is defending and praising the city of Xiamen, emphasizing its quality of life in terms of environment, education, transportation, and healthcare. They argue that many local people prefer to return to Xiamen after studying elsewhere, and that the city is particularly desirable despite lower wages for some due to the large population of lower-income individuals. The author implies that living in Xiamen is a desirable choice and that its livability and environment make it a ""true"" or ""high-quality"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xiamen local people want to return to Xiamen after finishing studies"" implies a strong attachment to the city and its value as a place of origin.  
- ""Xiamen is a city where environment, education, transportation, and medical services are all up to standard"" points to **functional livability**.  
- ""Environment is rarely matched by other urban areas"" emphasizes the **environmental quality** of the city.  
- ""Population is not too large, national average"" suggests the author considers **population density** as a factor in the city's quality and livability.  
- The author contrasts Xiamen with other cities and implicitly positions it as a **desirable local area**, which may imply **local identity value** based on these features.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **functional livability** of Xiamen—its environment, education, transportation, and healthcare—as a standard to affirm the city's **value as a ""local"" area** and to justify why locals would want to return or stay.

- ""Xiamen housing prices are so high"" is a factual or evaluative statement about economic conditions.
- No explicit or implicit link is made between housing prices and the definition of ""local people"" or ""local areas.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement does not serve to define, evaluate, or judge ""local identity."" It is a general comment on housing costs and does not imply a standard for local belonging or identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** use this statement to define or evaluate ""local identity."" Therefore, **no RL category is applicable**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not express or imply any criteria for defining ""local identity,"" it does **not** match any RL category.

听说厦门的房价都是隔壁市区的富商炒起来的,N/A,"  
The author is commenting on the housing market in Xiamen, suggesting that housing prices are inflated by wealthy individuals from neighboring districts. While the author does not explicitly define ""local identity,"" they are implying a distinction between ""local residents"" and ""outsiders"" (i.e., the ""富商"" or wealthy from other areas) in terms of influence over the local housing market.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""隔壁市区的富商"" (wealthy individuals from neighboring districts) implies a boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local"" groups.
- The author is indirectly suggesting that ""local"" housing prices are being manipulated by ""outsiders,"" which may reflect a critique of how economic power from outside the local area affects local life or identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not directly defining ""local identity"" but is implying a distinction between local residents and outsiders based on **economic influence** and **origin**. This suggests that **economic status and place of origin** may be used to define or evaluate who has a legitimate stake in the local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not explicitly endorsing** any standard for defining ""local identity,"" but rather **describing a phenomenon** in which outsiders (in terms of economic power and geographic origin) influence the local housing market. Since the author is **not asserting** that these outsiders are not ""local"" or that their influence undermines local identity, and the text does **not clearly use this as a standard for defining who is ""local""**, the content does **not meet the criteria** for annotation.

5. Final Judgment:  
The text **does not explicitly or strongly imply** that the author is using economic influence or geographic origin as a standard to define ""local identity."" The focus is on **housing prices and their causes**, not on **criteria for judging who is ""local.""**

Output:"
堵车！不好停车！房价高,N/A,"  
The author expresses dissatisfaction with traffic congestion, difficulty in parking, and high housing prices. These are clearly objective conditions or characteristics of a place. However, **no explicit or implicit statement is made** that these factors are used to define who is or is not a ""local person"" or to evaluate the ""localness"" of an area in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""堵车"" (traffic congestion)  
- ""不好停车"" (hard to park)  
- ""房价高"" (high housing prices)  

These are all **descriptive observations** about a place's conditions and **do not reflect a logic or standard used by the author to define local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument or logic** present in the text that ties these factors to the definition of local identity. The author is **not using them to judge who is local or to define what constitutes a local area** in the context of identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** any of these as criteria for defining local identity. They are **not used to evaluate or establish localness**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text **does not involve any criteria or logic for defining local identity**, **no RL category is applicable**.

Output:"
厦门房价比广州还高,N/A,"  
The author simply states a comparison between housing prices in Xiamen and Guangzhou, indicating that Xiamen's housing prices are higher. However, there is **no explicit or implicit indication** that this housing price difference is being used as a **standard to define ""local identity""** or to evaluate who qualifies as ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xiamen housing prices are higher than Guangzhou"" is an economic or material fact, not a standard for judging local identity.  
- No mention of property ownership, economic status, or how this price difference influences identity or social belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement is purely descriptive and does not engage in any argument about how housing prices relate to local identity. There is no indication that the author is using housing prices to define or evaluate local people or areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse or imply that housing prices are a criterion for defining local identity. Therefore, **no RL category is applicable**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use housing prices to define or evaluate local identity, and the statement is merely a factual comparison, **no RL label applies**.

The author contrasts their own upbringing in Qingxiu District (""土生土长"") with the recent migration of some classmates from the countryside to Nanning's ASEAN Business District. The author feels that the local identity of those who grew up in Qingxiu is authentic and unproblematic, while the newcomers from the countryside—despite now living in the city—display an exaggerated sense of superiority. This reflects a clear endorsement of local identity rooted in generational settlement and childhood upbringing in the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) is a key phrase indicating family rootedness.  
- The author contrasts themselves and their childhood friends (who were born and raised in Qingxiu) with ""newcomers"" from the countryside.  
- The mention of ""乡镇来这边买房定居或读书"" (buying houses or moving for education from the countryside) points to migration and a contrast in social embeddedness.  
- The author implicitly rejects the newcomers' sense of superiority, suggesting that they do not truly belong to the ""local"" group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family rootedness** (""土生土长"") as the core standard for defining ""local"" identity, and implicitly criticizes the newcomers for lacking this rootedness. The contrast between those who grew up in the area and those who moved there later is central to the author's argument about who truly belongs to the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **generational settlement and childhood upbringing** as the standard for authentic local identity. The implied criticism of newcomers’ ""优越感"" (superiority complex) further reinforces that the author does not consider them as ""true locals.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as the author emphasizes being born and raised in the area as the basis for local identity and contrasts this with those who moved there later.

青秀区以前不就是大农村吗小时候在埌西，西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷，后面一几年到东盟商务区买房，也是几千块一平而已,RL6,"  
The author is reflecting on their personal experience of moving from a rural area (Làngxī, Xixiangtang) to a more developed urban district (ASEAN Business District). They mention being considered ""poor"" by peers due to their background and later buying a house at a relatively low price in a more developed area. This reflects a shift in social status and spatial identity, and implies that the author sees property ownership and the location of residence as indicators of local status and economic belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Spatial shift from rural to urban**: ""青秀区以前不就是大农村吗"" (Qingxiu District used to be a big rural area) implies a change in the area’s status and the author's perception of it.  
- **Social status and economic judgment**: ""同学都觉得我家穷"" (classmates thought my family was poor) reflects social perception and economic status as part of local identity.  
- **Property ownership in a new urban area**: ""后面一几年到东盟商务区买房"" (bought a house in the ASEAN Business District in the early 2010s) and ""也是几千块一平而已"" (it was only a few thousand per square meter) indicate the author's use of property ownership in a newly developed area as a marker of local identity and upward mobility.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **property ownership in a newly developed area** as a marker of improved social and local status. The shift from being seen as ""rural"" and ""poor"" to owning property in a central, urban district reflects the author’s belief that **residing in and investing in a desirable urban area** is a way to become part of the ""local"" group and gain symbolic recognition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **residing in a newly developed urban area and owning property there** is a valid way to establish or enhance one's local identity and social standing. This is not just about preference, but about how the author perceives the **value of the area and their own status within the local identity framework**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s emphasis on **owning property in a newly developed and desirable urban area** as a means to improve social status and local identity aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as it reflects how **property ownership and spatial positioning** are used as symbols of belonging and legitimacy within a local community.

所以说啊，青秀区土著能有啥优越感啊，我小时候在医科大那边，去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑,"RL1, RL3","  
The author is reflecting on their childhood experience of growing up in an area that is not the core urban district (西乡塘, 朝阳), and mentions that they had to travel to those areas for shopping and entertainment. The author contrasts this with the ""native residents of Qingxiu District"" (青秀区土著), implying that those in more central or developed areas may claim a kind of superiority. The author is implicitly rejecting the idea of such ""native"" superiority by highlighting their own lived experience in a less central area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""青秀区土著"" (native residents of Qingxiu District) refers to people whose families have long resided in the area, aligning with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
- The author describes their own childhood location (医科大, 朝阳, 西乡塘), which are areas that are not considered the core urban center, and emphasizes the need to travel to Qingxiu for basic urban activities. This reflects a **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it involves a perception of which areas are considered ""real"" or ""central"" urban areas.  
- The tone of the text suggests a critique of the perceived superiority of ""natives"" of Qingxiu District, but the author does not explicitly endorse any alternative standard for defining local identity beyond rejecting this one.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the contrast between ""Qingxiu natives"" and their own upbringing in a peripheral area to imply that the former may wrongly claim superiority based on being ""natives"" of a more developed or central area. This reflects a **RL1** logic, as it involves a shared perception of spatial hierarchy and what counts as the ""real"" city center. The use of ""土著"" (natives) also touches on **RL3**, as it refers to long-term settlement and generational rootedness in a specific area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that being a ""native"" of a certain area (RL3) is used to claim a kind of local superiority. The author **rejects** this standard, but the existence of the critique itself implies that this standard is in play. Additionally, the author's description of which areas are considered ""urban"" or ""developed"" (Qingxiu) versus ""non-core"" (西乡塘, 朝阳) reflects a **RL1** logic of vernacular spatial authority.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority** is relevant because the author discusses the perceived hierarchy of urban areas and which areas are considered the ""real"" city center.  
- **RL3: Family Rootedness** is also relevant because the term ""青秀区土著"" (natives of Qingxiu District) implies a generational or ancestral connection to the area, which is used to justify a sense of local superiority.

The author acknowledges that Chaoyang Square is crowded and mixed in terms of population (""鱼龙混杂""), but asserts that ""authentic Nanning people"" would not criticize Chaoyang negatively. This implies that being a ""true local"" is tied to an emotional or cultural acceptance of certain areas, regardless of their perceived shortcomings.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Authentic Nanning people"" implies a core group of locals defined by a shared cultural or emotional identity.  
- The idea that ""true locals"" would not criticize Chaoyang suggests a habitual or emotional connection to the area and its acceptance as part of the local identity.  
- The phrase ""正宗南宁人"" (""authentic Nanning people"") implies a standard or logic for defining who is a ""true local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the idea that ""true Nanning people"" would not criticize Chaoyang to suggest that local identity is defined by a habitual or cultural acceptance of the city's spaces, including those that are chaotic or mixed. This reflects a shared regional perception and emotional attachment to the area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that being a ""true local"" involves a shared cultural or emotional acceptance of certain areas of the city, even if they are not ideal. This is a form of habitual regional cognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL1, as it reflects the author's use of habitual regional cognition and emotional attachment to define ""true locals"" based on shared perceptions of city areas.

The author is describing the living environment of Xixiangtang, noting its mix of old and new buildings, the presence of several ""urban villages"" (城中村), and its proximity to public transportation and daily amenities. The author concludes that it is a convenient and lively place to live, especially for those who prioritize accessibility and convenience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xixiangtang has many urban villages"" and ""the metro stations near Chaoyang Square are in urban villages"" describe the spatial and built environment.  
- ""New and old buildings mixed"" and ""not as new as Qingxiu and Wuxiang"" refer to the physical quality and modernity of the area.  
- ""Convenient for living"" and ""everything like zoo, train station, Chaoyang is here"" emphasize functional livability and access to daily necessities.  
- The author is using these factors to justify the desirability of the area for living, especially for people who prioritize convenience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **functional livability** of the area—such as proximity to transportation, daily services, and convenience of living—as a **standard for evaluating the area's desirability and its value as a ""local"" place to live**. While the area may not be as modern as Qingxiu or Wuxiang, it is considered a practical and convenient local living option.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **functional livability** as a key criterion for defining what makes a place a good ""local"" area, especially for daily living and convenience.

The author reflects on the differences in urban environments and the character of people in different areas of Nanning. They describe a personal experience of traveling to a more densely populated and youthful area (ChaoYang Square) via subway, contrasting it with their quieter, less crowded residential area. The author’s positive emotional response to the vibrant, youthful energy of ChaoYang Square suggests that they associate such characteristics with a more dynamic or desirable urban core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Different areas have different street crowds""** implies the author perceives qualitative differences in urban areas.  
- **""密密麻麻的人群, 都还是年轻人居多""** (dense crowds, mostly young people) highlights the demographic and vitality of the area.  
- **""城市非常有朝气""** (the city feels very energetic) reflects the author’s evaluative judgment of the area.  
- **""坐地铁去朝阳广场""** (taking the subway to ChaoYang Square) and the contrast with their own quiet neighborhood implies a spatial boundary between what is considered a core, vibrant ""city"" and a less central or less lively area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses **the presence of a vibrant, youthful crowd and convenient public transportation** as a marker of a ""real"" or ""desirable"" city area. This suggests a standard for defining what constitutes a ""local"" or central urban space, and by implication, who might be considered part of the ""local"" community (those who live or frequent such vibrant areas).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **vibrant, youthful, and well-connected urban areas (like ChaoYang Square)** represent the core or desirable parts of the city. This reflects a standard for defining what a ""local"" area is and, by extension, who might be considered part of the ""local"" identity (those who live in or engage with such areas).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **functional livability** (e.g., convenient subway access, availability of commercial centers like Wanjia Plaza) and **environmental quality** (vibrant, youthful crowd) as criteria for defining a desirable local area. This aligns with **RL5**, which evaluates areas based on material infrastructure and the quality of life they offer, which the author implicitly links to defining what a ""local"" area is.

The author is responding to a generalization about the entire Qingxiu District by emphasizing that people who grew up in the area (e.g., on Xinghu Road) do not usually talk down about other parts of the district, especially since their own homes were also not in good condition. This implies a rejection of simplistic or spatially rigid definitions of ""localness"" based on material conditions or neighborhood quality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候住星湖路"" (grew up on Xinghu Road) indicates a **long-term personal history** in the area, potentially aligning with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.  
- The author implies that people from the area do not judge other parts of the district based on material conditions, which **rejects RL5 (Functional Livability)** as a rigid standard for defining local identity.  
- The text does **not** appeal to administrative boundaries (RL2), linguistic markers (RL4), or occupational identity (RL7), nor does it invoke symbolic spatial divisions (RL1).  
- The emphasis is on **shared lived experience and personal growth history** in the area, which supports a sense of belonging based on **historical rootedness**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending the idea that being a ""local"" is not about judging other areas based on material conditions (e.g., how ""shabby"" they are), especially when one’s own background is similar. The author implicitly argues that **growing up in the area** and **shared lived experience** are more important than external evaluations of spatial quality. This reinforces the idea that **long-term personal or familial ties to the area** are what define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **growing up in the area** and **not judging it based on material conditions** is a key part of being a local. This supports **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as it centers on **long-term personal history and growth in the area** as a basis for identity.

The author recounts a personal experience from childhood in a relatively poor neighborhood in Nanning, where an elderly local resident proudly claims to be a ""Nanning native"" while living in a dilapidated, run-down area. The author finds this claim humorous and ironic, implying that **physical living conditions and social status** can be used to mock or challenge the legitimacy of someone's ""local identity"" claims. The author contrasts their own upbringing in a different part of the city with the ""local"" identity asserted by the elderly couple, suggesting that **geographical prestige and living environment** are used to judge or mock such identity claims.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The elderly couple's claim of being ""Nanning natives"" is based on their **generational settlement** (implying family roots in the area).  
- The author implies that **the quality of the living environment** (a poor, run-down neighborhood with a makeshift shed as a garage) contrasts with the couple's claim of being ""local,"" suggesting the author **disparages or questions** the legitimacy of their local identity based on **material and spatial conditions**.  
- The author's own background (growing up in ""山旮旯建政路"" — a less prestigious area) is mentioned, but it is not used to define local identity; rather, it is a point of contrast.  
- The author's **mocking tone** suggests that **functional livability and environmental quality** are implicitly used as a **standard to evaluate the legitimacy of ""local"" identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **poor living conditions and lack of modern amenities** in the elderly couple’s neighborhood as a **counterpoint** to their claim of being ""Nanning locals."" This implies that the author believes **living in a desirable, well-maintained area** is a more legitimate basis for claiming local identity. The **contrast between claimed local identity and actual living conditions** is central to the author's critique.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author identifies as a ""本南宁人"" (true Nanning person) and reflects on how growing up in Nanning meant frequently visiting a specific area, Chaoyang, for social gatherings. The author explains that while this used to be a common local activity, it has become less frequent due to practical issues like parking difficulties and increased alternatives as they grew older. The text implicitly frames Chaoyang as a historically and culturally significant local area tied to the author's childhood and identity as a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本南宁人"" (true Nanning person) implies a self-identification based on origin or long-term settlement.  
- ""小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩"" (used to love meeting friends at Chaoyang as a child) suggests Chaoyang as a historically and socially recognized local area.  
- ""长大后...朝阳又越来越难停车"" (as adults, parking in Chaoyang has become difficult) is a practical concern but not a defining standard for local identity.  
- The implicit contrast between the past and present use of Chaoyang reflects a shared, historically sedimented spatial perception of local areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses Chaoyang as a symbolic reference point for local childhood and social life, which is part of a broader shared understanding of what constitutes a ""local"" area. The reference to ""本南宁人"" and the habitual use of Chaoyang in social contexts align with a vernacular spatial authority that defines local identity through collective memory and regional attachment.

The author implies that Chaoyang was the symbolic and functional center of the city during that time, and that it served as the core area where important business decisions were made. This reflects a shared historical and spatial understanding of what constituted the ""real"" or ""core"" Nanning.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Chaoyang as the center"" implies a spatial perception of the city.  
- ""Old Wanguo Hotel"" is a historical landmark associated with the core area.  
- ""Business leaders gathering there"" suggests a symbolic and functional importance of the area.  
- ""Nanning wasn't that big back then"" reinforces the idea that Chaoyang was the central hub of the city, and thus, the real Nanning.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the historical and spatial perception of Chaoyang as the core of Nanning to define what constituted the ""real"" or ""true"" Nanning in the past. This reflects a shared understanding of city boundaries and core areas, which is a key aspect of local identity formation.

This implies that the author rejects the idea that administrative or geographic location (Qingxiu) alone defines local identity or social value. However, the author also implicitly acknowledges that such spatial distinctions exist and are used by others to define local hierarchies.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author resists the idea that Qingxiu is inherently superior, but the text does reflect the existence of a spatial hierarchy (RL1) that others may use to define local identity. The author does not endorse this hierarchy and instead critiques it. However, the author’s own identity as a Nanning person not from Qingxiu implies an awareness of and reaction to such spatial distinctions.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s critique of Qingxiu District’s perceived superiority is rooted in a socially conventional regional identity (RL1), which defines Qingxiu as a distinct and potentially more prestigious area. The author challenges this conventional wisdom but does not reject the idea of spatial distinctions entirely. Therefore, the text aligns with RL1.

没事啦，反正法国人看东南亚人（对就是她口中的东盟商务区）都像在看自己的殖民地人群不知道在狂什么，真的好笑（哦我土生土长南宁人）,RL3,"  
The author is expressing a sense of local pride and identity as someone ""土生土长南宁人"" (born and raised in Nanning). They are commenting on how a French person perceives the Southeast Asian population in the ASEAN Business Area of Nanning as if they were colonized people, which the author finds amusing and out of touch. The author implicitly contrasts the French outsider's perspective with their own grounded, local understanding of the city and its diverse population.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长南宁人"" (born and raised in Nanning) directly references family rootedness and long-term growth history in the city.
- The author's use of the phrase ""反正法国人看东南亚人..."" (the French see Southeast Asians...) reflects a contrast between outsider and insider perspectives.
- The author implicitly uses their own ""localness"" to justify their interpretation of the situation, distinguishing their view from the outsider's.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their long-term familial and personal connection to Nanning as a basis for their identity as a ""true local,"" which gives them the authority to critique the outsider's (French) perspective. This is central to how they define their own ""localness"" and how they distinguish themselves from outsiders.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in the area) is a legitimate and important criterion for defining local identity and having the right to interpret or evaluate local culture and social dynamics.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of family rootedness and individual growth history to define ""local identity,"" aligning with RL3.

The author is a native of Guangxi and expresses a sense of alienation and exclusion from the urban center (the capital city), referring to themselves as a ""subway old person"" (地铁老人脸), a term implying marginalization or being out of place in the modern urban setting. The author feels that people from remote rural areas in Guangxi are not accepted as ""true locals"" in the capital city and are instead pushed toward working in Guangdong or even emigrating. This reflects a judgment about who is considered a legitimate part of the local identity in the capital.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本广西人"" (native of Guangxi) indicates the author's self-identification as a local.  
- ""偏远农村的广西人"" (rural Guangxi people) suggests a generational or geographic distinction within the broader local population.  
- ""不配奢望首府"" (not entitled to aspire to the capital) implies that the author sees certain people (like themselves) as not being recognized as full members of the local identity in the capital.  
- The reference to ""拿起贵族姿态"" (adopting a noble/upper-class attitude) implies a class-based or symbolic hierarchy in the local identity system.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using both **geographic rootedness** (rural vs. capital) and **social embeddedness** (economic status, class perception) to define who is considered a legitimate part of the ""local"" identity in the capital city. The author feels excluded from the capital's local identity due to being from a rural area and lacking the economic or symbolic capital to be seen as belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **long-term settlement in a core urban area** (the capital) and **economic or social embeddedness** (such as being able to afford a certain lifestyle or being part of the urban middle or upper class) are criteria for being recognized as a ""true local."" This reflects an internalized or observed hierarchy of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author implicitly accepts a spatial hierarchy where the capital is the core and rural areas are excluded from the ""true local"" identity.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author feels excluded from the capital’s local identity due to lacking economic or social embeddedness, as suggested by the ""not entitled to aspire to the capital"" sentiment.

The author reflects on the emotional attachment that ""locals"" (土著) have to the old city area, emphasizing that it is where they grew up and lived for their entire lives. The author, who lives in Wuxiang near Nanning Bridge, notes that although it is geographically close to Qingxiu District (an area within the city center), commuting is still inconvenient compared to the old city. This reflects a contrast between the old city and newer areas, and the author implicitly acknowledges the symbolic value of the old city in defining a sense of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著对老城区的执念是比较深的毕竟是从小到大生活学习的地方"" – This highlights the deep emotional and historical attachment to the old city, based on long-term growth and settlement history.
- ""一过桥就可以回到青秀"" – Indicates proximity to the city center, which may relate to functional livability or spatial cognition.
- ""不习惯通勤习惯了5分钟就到，这里要提前20分钟起床"" – Reflects a comparison of living convenience between the old city and newer areas, which may imply functional livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes that ""locals"" (土著) have a strong emotional and historical connection to the old city, which is where they were born and raised. This is a key marker of local identity. The author also contrasts the convenience of the old city with the inconvenience of living in a newer area, but this is not used as a standard to define who is local — it's more of a personal inconvenience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that being born and raised in the old city is a defining feature of being a ""true local."" The comparison of commuting convenience is more of a personal observation and not used as a standard for judging local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as it emphasizes the deep emotional and historical attachment to the old city due to being born and raised there — a key marker of local identity in this context.

The author explains their housing situation in Qingshao District, mentioning that they own two properties there. One of the properties is a ""unit collective housing"" (单位集资房), which is tied to employment, and they have a shareholding right with the potential to receive dividends. The author also notes that the size of the house is determined by professional title (职称高低), and their father decided to purchase it. This shows how **property ownership, employment-based social networks, and hierarchical economic status** are linked to the author’s local identity and settlement in the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""两套了"" (two properties)**: Indicates property ownership in the area, a key indicator of social embeddedness.  
- **""单位集资房"" (unit collective housing)**: A housing type typically tied to employment and social networks.  
- **""有股份，可以得分红"" (has shares and can receive dividends)**: Indicates ownership of local assets and participation in the local economic structure.  
- **""按照职称高低才能买房子的大小"" (house size is determined by professional title)**: Shows a connection between social/economic hierarchy and access to housing, a form of embeddedness.  
- **""我爸说买咯"" (my father said to buy it)**: Implies intergenerational decision-making and embeddedness in the local system.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses property ownership (especially in a form tied to employment and social status), economic participation (dividends), and social hierarchy (职称决定住房大小) as indicators of being embedded in the local area. These factors are not just personal preferences but are **tied to the author’s legitimacy as a local resident**—they are part of the **local economic and social structure**, which is a core part of defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **property ownership in the area, particularly through employment-linked housing, and participation in local economic systems (e.g., shares, dividends)** are **key markers of local identity and embeddedness**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** category, as it uses **property ownership in the local area, employment-based social networks, and participation in local economic systems (e.g., shares, dividends)** as criteria to define the author’s local identity and legitimacy as a ""local person.""

住惯单位宿舍的不习惯住商业小区。每次想吃什么都要回老城区，特别是吃宵夜，动不动开车大半个小时，心鸭。这两天又把我崽拎回娘家蹭住，为了今晚能去琅东村觅食,RL1,"  
The author reflects on their lifestyle and living preferences, indicating that they are used to living in a unit dormitory (typically associated with older urban workers or state-owned enterprises) and find it inconvenient to live in a commercial residential area. They express a strong attachment to the old city center, especially for eating, including late-night snacks, and even drive for up to half an hour to return there. The author also mentions bringing their child back to the mother’s place (implying a nearby or familiar location) just to eat at a specific place in Langdong Village. This reflects a deep-rooted connection to the old city center as the core of their local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住惯单位宿舍"" (used to living in unit dormitories) suggests a long-term settlement and historical rootedness in a specific area.  
- ""每次想吃什么都要回老城区"" (every time they want to eat something, they have to go back to the old city center) indicates a habitual spatial attachment to the old city.  
- ""特别是吃宵夜"" (especially for late-night snacks) emphasizes the cultural and social significance of the old city in the author’s life.  
- ""动不动开车大半个小时"" (often driving for half an hour) suggests that the old city is perceived as a distinct and essential part of the local identity, despite the physical distance.  
- ""把我崽拎回娘家蹭住"" (taking the child back to the mother’s place to stay) and ""为了今晚能去琅东村觅食"" (just to eat at Langdong Village tonight) imply that Langdong Village is part of the familiar and valued local space.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly defines ""local"" as being closely tied to the old city center and its surrounding areas, especially those with long-standing residential and cultural significance (like unit dormitories and Langdong Village). This habitual spatial attachment and emotional connection to the old city are used to distinguish the core of local identity from newer or more distant areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that the old city center and its surrounding areas (like Langdong Village) are the true ""local"" space, based on long-term settlement and habitual spatial behavior. This reflects a deep-rooted local identity based on place of long-term residence and emotional attachment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author defines ""local"" based on habitual spatial cognition and emotional attachment to the old city and its surrounding areas, which are perceived as the authentic or essential local space.

The author is expressing discomfort with living in Wu Xiang (五象), a new urban development area in Nanning. The discomfort stems from the lack of immediate urban amenities and the long walk required to reach a place with a sense of urban life. The author contrasts this with their expectations of a convenient, centralized urban environment, implying that such functional livability is a standard for a ""real"" or desirable local living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""每次在五象湖地铁站出口下车出来就感觉瞬间从城市到了荒郊野岭""** indicates a strong contrast between the expected urban environment and the actual experience of arriving in a remote or underdeveloped area.  
- **""要走一大段路才有点生活气息""** suggests a lack of immediate functional livability (amenities, convenience).  
- **""给我住我真不习惯""** reflects a personal judgment that the area does not meet the author’s expectations for a comfortable urban living environment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **lack of functional livability** (e.g., inconvenient access to amenities, underdeveloped urban infrastructure) to **evaluate the quality of the local area** and express a **negative judgment** on its suitability as a ""real"" or desirable urban living space. This implies that such functional characteristics are part of the author's implicit criteria for defining what constitutes a ""good"" or ""true"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **uses the quality of urban infrastructure and accessibility of amenities** as a standard to **evaluate the livability of a local area**, which is central to their judgment of whether it is a desirable place to live.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **definition of local identity or local area quality** based on **functional livability**, such as proximity to amenities and urban convenience. It aligns with **RL5**.

The author comments on the location of Nanning Bridgehead (""南宁大桥头""), expressing that it is a good location, but also mentions that commuting during rush hours is very stressful. The text reflects a personal evaluation of the area's livability and functionality, particularly in terms of traffic and convenience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""那个位置好好"" (""That location is good"") implies a positive evaluation of the area’s functional livability.
- ""早晚高峰过桥很崩溃"" (""It’s very stressful to cross the bridge during rush hours"") highlights a specific inconvenience in transportation and daily life.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating the area based on its practical livability, such as location quality and traffic conditions. However, this is a **personal preference or observation**, and **there is no explicit or implicit indication** that the author is using these factors to define who qualifies as ""local"" or to judge the status of a local area in terms of identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text discusses functional livability (RL5), it does **not** link this evaluation to a standard for defining local identity. It is a **personal assessment of convenience**, not a normative standard for judging localness or the hierarchy of local areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not using the livability of the area to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate who is or is not local, **no RL category applies** in this case.

The author is discussing the availability of *jizifu* (集资房, collectively funded housing) near the medical university in Wuxiang Panlong and the Wu鸣 campus. The author’s parents were eager to participate in the Wu鸣 project, but due to the lack of subway access, they gave up. The mention of Wu鸣 and Wuxiang Panlong reflects a contrast in accessibility and livability between areas. The author is implicitly evaluating the desirability of a local area based on the presence of housing options and public transportation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- *Jizifu* (collectively funded housing) implies property ownership and investment in a local area.  
- Mention of the Wu鸣 campus and its planned *jizifu* indicates a potential for local embeddedness or investment in a developing area.  
- The decision to abandon the Wu鸣 project due to the lack of a subway line highlights the author's prioritization of functional livability (transportation access).  
- The contrast between Wuxiang Panlong (with *jizifu*) and Wu鸣 (without subway) implies a hierarchy of desirable local areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence of *jizifu* and the availability of subway access as key factors in evaluating the livability and desirability of a local area. These factors influence whether a place is seen as a viable or desirable place to live, and by extension, whether it is considered part of a ""real"" or ""valuable"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of functional livability—specifically, access to housing (e.g., *jizifu*) and public transportation (subway)—as criteria for judging the quality and desirability of a local area. This is not just a preference but a standard used to make decisions about where to live and which areas are worth investing in.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as it evaluates the quality of a local area based on material infrastructure and convenience (housing and subway access), which are used to judge its desirability and value in the context of local identity.

The author expresses a personal preference for the quiet and convenient living environment in the Nangang (五象) area of Nanning. They highlight the wide roads (no traffic congestion), good air quality, riverside walking at night, and convenient access to commercial and residential areas such as IKEA, Wanxiang, the headquarters base, and Sam’s Club. In contrast, returning to the urban core (青秀区) results in traffic congestion. The author implies that Nangang is a more desirable and comfortable ""local"" living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""马路很宽不会堵车"" (wide roads, no traffic) → **functional livability** (transportation convenience).  
- ""空气也很好"" (good air quality) → **functional livability** (environmental quality).  
- ""宜家，万象汇，总部基地那块吃的，购物也很方便"" (convenient dining and shopping) → **functional livability** (amenities and services).  
- ""山姆也就20分钟就到了"" (Sam’s Club is just 20 minutes away) → **functional livability** (access to services).  
- ""回市区感觉哪哪都堵"" (traffic is congested everywhere in the urban core) → **functional livability** (negative contrast with Nangang).  
- The author implies that Nangang is a **better ""local"" living area** due to these functional advantages.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **functional livability** as the primary standard to define and evaluate the desirability of a ""local"" living area. They explicitly contrast Nangang with the urban core (Qingxiu District) and argue that Nangang is more comfortable and convenient, thus implying that **functional livability** is a key criterion for defining a high-quality ""local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **functional livability** (transportation, environment, amenities) as the basis for defining a desirable local area and for differentiating between ""good"" and ""less good"" local areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5**, as the author uses **functional livability** (transportation convenience, environmental quality, and access to amenities) to define and evaluate the quality of a local area.

The author reflects on the generational and social change in how people relate to their local identity, particularly in the context of urban transformation in Nanning. They describe how many Nanning people grew up in ""大院"" (compound-style residential areas), moved out, bought new homes, and now feel disconnected from the old neighborhoods due to changes in social dynamics and living environments. The author laments the loss of the ""old neighborhood"" feeling and suggests that the ""old city area"" is no longer the same, indicating a shift in what is considered a ""local"" living experience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""大院长大"" (grew up in the compound) reflects **family rootedness** and **individual growth history** in a specific local area.  
- ""再回到大院住也没曾经的感觉"" (returning to the compound no longer feels the same) implies **a change in social embeddedness and community relationships**.  
- ""不符合现在的邻里关系了"" (no longer fits the current neighborhood relationships) suggests **a shift in social embeddedness** and **a redefinition of local community standards**.  
- ""老城区固然好，过去的终将也是过去了"" (the old city area is good, but the past is the past) implies a **change in the symbolic value of the old city area**, possibly tied to **vernacular spatial authority**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing that the **sense of ""local identity"" is no longer tied to the old neighborhood or the old city area**, but has shifted due to urban development and social changes. The **loss of the ""old neighborhood""** is tied to **family history and social embeddedness**, and the author is implicitly suggesting that **what used to define a ""local"" living experience is no longer valid today**. This reflects both **a shift in spatial cognition** and **a change in social embeddedness**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** that **local identity is shaped by family history (growing up in a specific area)** and **social embeddedness (community relationships and shared living experiences)**. The **change in these conditions** is what causes the **feeling of disconnection from the ""old local identity""**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The author emphasizes growing up in a specific residential area (""大院""), which is a generational and personal rootedness in the local area.

因为渝中的拆迁户基本上都在李家沱,RL3,"  
The author states that most of the displaced residents (拆迁户) from Yuzhong are now located in Lijiaopo. This suggests that there is a historical and spatial shift of people from one area to another, and that Lijiaopo is now home to people who were originally from Yuzhong. This could imply that the author sees Lijiaopo as a place where ""original Yuzhong people"" have relocated, potentially influencing local identity in Lijiaopo.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Yuzhong’s displaced residents are mostly in Lijiaopo"" implies a **historical relocation** and **generational settlement** pattern.  
- The statement suggests a **link between origin (Yuzhong) and current settlement (Lijiaopo)**, potentially implying that the relocated residents retain a connection to their original area and may still be considered part of the local identity in Lijiaopo.  
- The focus is on **family or community relocation history**, not just individual migration.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the relocation of Yuzhong residents to Lijiaopo to indicate that these people are now part of the Lijiaopo area, and by implication, may be considered part of the local population. This reflects the **importance of family settlement history and generational ties** in defining local identity, especially in the context of displacement and resettlement.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly supports the idea that people who were originally from Yuzhong and now live in Lijiaopo due to relocation should still be considered part of the local identity in Lijiaopo. This aligns with the **generational settlement and historical rootedness** criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The statement reflects a **family historical rootedness** logic—people who were originally from a certain area and now live elsewhere due to relocation are still connected to their origin and may be seen as part of the local identity in their new location. This aligns with **RL3**.

The author is expressing surprise or disapproval at the idea of people from **Yuzhong District** (a core urban area in Chongqing) moving to **Lijia沱 (Lijia沱, a different district in Chongqing)**. The phrase ""干撒子"" (what for? / what purpose?) implies a dismissive or critical tone, suggesting that such a move is unnecessary or undesirable. This implies a belief that moving from a core urban area to a peripheral or different district is incongruous with being a ""true local"" or maintaining a certain local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to **Yuzhong District** and **Lijia沱** as specific geographic areas.
- The author assumes a distinction between these areas in terms of local identity or status.
- The phrase ""不会吧...跑...去干撒子"" (Can it be that... went to... for what?) implies a normative expectation of where ""true locals"" should reside or identify with.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **geographic area** as a marker of local identity, implying that Yuzhong is a core or legitimate part of the city, while Lijia沱 is not (or is less legitimate). The disapproval of the move suggests that maintaining a connection to the core area is part of being a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **geographic area** (specifically, being from Yuzhong) is a standard for defining ""local identity,"" and that moving to a different area may undermine or contradict that identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is using a shared, habitual perception of urban spatial boundaries (Yuzhong vs. Lijia沱) to define who is a ""true local"" and where their identity is rooted.

The author explicitly uses the phrase ""**土生土长**"" (born and raised here) to describe their own identity in relation to a specific location (ddk, likely a shorthand for a local area or district). They also mention their father's and their own ID card prefixes, which are used to indicate administrative or regional origin. This shows a strong emphasis on generational settlement and administrative origin as markers of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长 ddk"" indicates the author was born and raised in ddk, reflecting family rootedness and long-term settlement.  
- ""爸爸是510203，我是500104"" refers to ID card numbers, which are tied to administrative legitimacy and regional origin.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **generational settlement history** (土生土长) and **administrative origin** (ID card prefixes) to define their local identity. These elements are used to affirm a sense of belonging and legitimacy as a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both **family rootedness** (RL3) and **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as criteria for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The ID card prefixes are used to indicate regional administrative origin, which the author treats as part of their identity.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**: The phrase ""土生土长"" directly indicates long-term family settlement and personal growth in the local area, which is a core criterion for local identity.

The author describes their own personal history of residence, mentioning that they grew up in Nanping, currently live in Puzhi, and their parents are considering moving back to Nanping. This implies a personal connection to Nanping and reflects on the changing spatial relationships and emotional attachments to different areas. The author seems to implicitly value the place where they were raised, which may be linked to their sense of ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候在南坪"" (grew up in Nanping) — indicates an individual's long-term growth history in a place, which is a core feature of RL3 (Family Rootedness/Individual Growth History).  
- ""现在在坡区"" (currently in Puzhi) — describes current residence, but not explicitly tied to identity or evaluation.  
- ""爸妈又在考虑搬回南坪"" (parents are considering moving back to Nanping) — may imply emotional or identity-based attachment to the original place of upbringing.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key element is the author's mention of having grown up in Nanping, which is a core criterion for RL3. The author's current and potential future residence does not directly contribute to defining ""local identity,"" but the emphasis on where they were raised does. The author may be implicitly using their early life in Nanping to affirm a sense of local identity or rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly mentions growing up in Nanping, which is a direct expression of personal growth history in a place. This is a clear indicator of RL3, as it reflects the author's own rootedness and potential identity attachment to that area.

The author is reflecting on their family's evolving perception of what constitutes the ""urban core"" or ""true city area"" in Chongqing, particularly in contrast to the author's own lived experience and current reality. The author notes that their parents, shaped by long-standing spatial cognition, still define the city center as areas like Jiefangbei or Dadong (解放碑/大坪), and are initially dismissive of newer, outer-lying areas like Zhaomushan (照母山), which the author now recognizes as a central and developed area. This reflects a tension between **historical spatial cognition** and **changing urban development**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author's family (especially their parents) hold **traditional spatial perceptions** of the city center (Jiefangbei, Dadong).  
- The author **challenges** or contrasts these perceptions with their own lived experience in newer, developed areas like Zhaomushan.  
- The family's perception of what constitutes a ""real city area"" is **rooted in long-term settlement and generational habit**, aligning with **socially sedimented spatial cognition**.  
- The author's current residence and work location (Jixingang, Zhaomushan) show a **disconnection between the family’s perception and the author's reality**, emphasizing **spatial legitimacy** and **urban expansion**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly using **historical and socially sedimented spatial cognition** to explain how their family defines ""city"" and ""local"" identity. The contrast between the family’s traditional view and the author’s modern experience highlights how **spatial legitimacy** is constructed through shared historical perceptions and how these perceptions can lag behind actual urban development. The author’s frustration at their family’s inability to recognize Zhaomushan as a central area reflects an implicit critique of outdated spatial definitions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly **endorses the traditional spatial perception** as a criterion for defining ""city"" or ""local"" identity, at least as it is held by the older generation. However, they also **contrast** this with their own experience, suggesting that the older generation’s perception is **outdated** or **incomplete** in the context of new urban development. This reflects **RL1**, which is about **socially sedimented spatial cognition** and how such cognitive maps are used to define what counts as ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s text reflects a **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** perspective, where the family’s long-standing perception of the city center is used as a standard to define what is considered the ""real city"" or ""local"" area. The author implicitly acknowledges that this perception is still influential, even if it no longer aligns with the actual urban landscape.

The mention of being ""土生土长"" (born and raised there) emphasizes a deep-rooted, long-term connection to the original district, which is a key indicator of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长"" (born and raised here)** is a strong indicator of **generational rootedness** and personal growth history in a place.  
- **Mention of a specific administrative district (500107)** and a **newer urban area (Liangjiang New Area)** implies a contrast or transition in spatial identity.  
- The text does not explicitly use administrative boundaries or social perceptions of the area to define local identity, but the **""土生土长""** element is central.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the phrase **""土生土长""** to assert their **deep, generational connection** to a specific district, which is a key marker of local identity. This implies that **long-term personal history in the area is a defining standard** for being considered a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **being born and raised in a district** is a defining criterion for local identity. The mention of moving to a newer area does not negate this, but rather highlights a contrast between old and new spaces.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author describes their personal life trajectory: growing up in Liangkou Road, moving back to the ""slope area"" at age 8, and then staying in the Yangjiajing area for a long time. This reflects a personal history of settlement and emphasizes the long-term connection to a specific local area. The author uses this to establish their own identity as someone who has deep roots in the region.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候住两路口"" (grew up in Liangkou Road) indicates early settlement history.  
- ""八岁搬回坡区"" (moved back to the slope area at age 8) shows a return to a region with historical roots.  
- ""一直在杨家坪前后打转转"" (has stayed around Yangjiajing ever since) emphasizes long-term, continuous settlement in the area.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using their **long-term growth and settlement history** to implicitly define their own ""local identity."" The mention of specific areas and the pattern of returning and staying in a region suggests that the author sees these experiences as central to being considered a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

是不是开始有成都口音了,RL4,"  
The question ""是不是开始有成都口音了"" (Have you started to speak with a Chengdu accent?) implies that the speaker is observing or questioning whether the person being addressed is beginning to adopt the local dialect or accent. This reflects an implicit assumption that speaking with a Chengdu accent is a marker of local identity or integration into the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a linguistic feature associated with local identity.  
- The question implies that adopting a local accent is a sign of becoming part of the local group.

The author is contrasting the population composition of Chongqing with that of other major cities, emphasizing that Chongqing's main urban area is still predominantly composed of ""locals"" and that the influx of non-local accents (i.e., migrants with different dialects) is a recent phenomenon. This implies that the author defines ""local people"" based on **historical settlement patterns and cultural linguistic recognition**, and perceives the presence of non-local accents as a marker of being an outsider.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地人"" (locals) is the key term being defined.
- The contrast with ""一线城市"" (true first-tier cities) implies that the author is using Chongqing as a case where local identity remains strong.
- ""外地口音"" (non-local accents) is mentioned as a distinguishing marker of migrants, suggesting **linguistic-cultural recognition** is used to identify non-locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **linguistic-cultural recognition** (i.e., the presence of non-local accents) to distinguish between locals and migrants. The argument is that Chongqing has historically been less affected by large-scale migration and therefore retains a stronger local identity. The implication is that **speaking with a local accent** is a marker of belonging and local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, the presence of non-local accents) as a standard for distinguishing between locals and non-locals. The author's contrast with other cities and the emphasis on recent migration also suggest an implicit cultural attachment to the local dialect and identity.

The author contrasts this with people who may have moved in later or are from areas that were incorporated into the city after the direct administration (直辖) status was granted to Chongqing. This reflects a strong generational and historical claim to being a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长""** (born and raised here) directly refers to **family historical rootedness**.
- **""解放碑五一路""** and **""500103""** imply **administrative legitimacy** (as the district code is an official administrative marker).
- The contrast between older residents and those who came later (or were incorporated into the city later) suggests **social habit-based spatial cognition** (RL1) in how the author defines ""true locals.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational settlement** (""土生土长"") and **administrative legitimacy** (district code) to **assert the authenticity of their local identity**. The emphasis on administrative code and the idea that people from incorporated areas or later migrants are not the ""true locals"" also reflects **a socially conventional understanding of urban area boundaries**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **family historical rootedness** (RL3) and **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as criteria for defining ""true local"" identity. The implicit boundary between ""old"" and ""new"" locals also aligns with **social habit-based spatial cognition** (RL1).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** is directly used through ""土生土长"" and the implication that long-term settlement in a specific area is what makes someone a ""true local.""

This suggests that generational depth of settlement and personal growth history in the area are central to the author's understanding of what it means to be a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being born and raised in a place, and having a long-term, habitual connection to it, is a defining criterion for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness (家族历史根基/个体成长史)**, as it emphasizes generational settlement and personal growth history as the basis for defining local identity.

我爸因为50年前因为工作原因从渝中区换到九龙坡区 因为有套房所以户口也就转到在九龙坡了 ，那时候没得房价更值钱的概念 上班要坐绿皮火车太折腾了…… 早知道就死守渝中区哟,"RL1, RL2","  
The author is reflecting on their father's relocation from Yuzhong District to Jiangbeipo District 50 years ago due to work. They mention that the move was accompanied by a change in hukou (household registration) due to property ownership, and express regret that at the time there was no awareness of property value. The author implies that staying in Yuzhong would have been a better choice, likely due to its perceived status and value as a ""core local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""从渝中区换到九龙坡区""** (moved from Yuzhong to Jiangbeipo) implies a shift in spatial identity and potentially a change in perceived ""localness.""
- **""户口也就转到在九龙坡了""** (hukou moved to Jiangbeipo) reflects the influence of administrative boundaries and registration on identity.
- **""早知道就死守渝中区哟""** (I wish we had stayed in Yuzhong) implies that Yuzhong is seen as a more legitimate or prestigious ""local"" area.
- **""那时候没得房价更值钱的概念""** (there was no concept of property value back then) suggests that property ownership and its value are now considered important for local identity or status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses **administrative boundaries (hukou and location)** and **spatial cognition (Yuzhong as the core area)** to evaluate local identity. The regret over moving from Yuzhong to Jiangbeipo reflects a belief that **Yuzhong is the more legitimate or ""true"" local area**, and that **hukou tied to property** is a meaningful marker of local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** both **administrative legitimacy (hukou tied to property)** and **vernacular spatial authority (Yuzhong as the core local area)** as criteria for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** through the hukou tied to property, and **vernacular spatial authority (RL1)** through the implied value of Yuzhong as a ""true local"" area. Both are used to evaluate and reflect on the author's family's ""local"" status.

市中心土生土长的很少 因为以前就没多少人 看以前的老照片就知道 又没高楼 外来的比较多,RL3,"  
The author is discussing the population history of the city center, emphasizing that there are few people who were ""土生土长"" (born and raised there) because the area historically had few residents and no high-rise buildings, with a large influx of outsiders. This implies that being born and raised in the city center is rare and that the current population is largely composed of migrants. The author seems to imply that ""土生土长"" is a key marker of ""true local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""市中心土生土长的很少"" (few people were born and raised in the city center)  
- ""以前就没多少人"" (few people lived there in the past)  
- ""又没高楼"" (no high-rise buildings)  
- ""外来的比较多"" (more outsiders have come in)  
- ""土生土长"" is a direct reference to **family rootedness** as a marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the concept of ""土生土长"" to distinguish between ""true locals"" and ""outsiders."" The contrast between historical sparsity and current influx of migrants supports the idea that only those who were born and raised in the area have the claim to being ""genuinely local."" This implies that generational settlement and origin are central to defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in the area) is a defining characteristic of being a ""true local."" This is a core marker of local identity according to the author.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as it emphasizes generational settlement and origin (""土生土长"") as the basis for defining ""local people.""

同意！下楼就是地铁安逸惨,N/A,"  
The author agrees with a previous statement and emphasizes that living in a place with convenient subway access is extremely comfortable (""安逸惨""). This reflects a preference for living in areas with good functional livability, particularly in terms of transportation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""下楼就是地铁"" (subway is right downstairs) refers to transportation convenience.  
- ""安逸惨"" (extremely comfortable) reflects an evaluation of the area's livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses transportation convenience (subway access) as a key indicator of a desirable living environment. While this is a strong indicator of functional livability, the text does **not** explicitly or strongly imply that the author uses this to define who is ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local area"" in terms of identity. The statement is more about personal comfort than about identity boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author expresses a personal preference for functional livability, but does **not** use this as a standard for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating the ""localness"" of an area in terms of identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text touches on functional livability (RL5), it **does not go beyond personal preference** to inform a standard for local identity or area definition. Therefore, it does **not** meet the annotation criteria.

The author is expressing a layered perspective on what constitutes a ""real"" or ""true"" local area (老长沙), with a focus on emotional attachment to one's hometown, functional livability (amenities and infrastructure), and cultural authenticity. The author contrasts the ""old Changsha"" with the ""new urban areas"" (e.g., Meixihu, Yueyangdao) and argues that the old city is more livable, culturally rich, and more ""authentically local"" due to its long-standing identity and better infrastructure per capita. The author also implies that long-term settlement and cultural internalization are essential for feeling a true connection to the city.

- **5.** ""移植到大脑的文化里"" and ""完善便捷的配套是重中之重"" combine **cultural embeddedness** and **functional livability** as essential for long-term settlement and identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- **Family Rootedness (RL3)** is used to establish emotional and psychological boundaries between ""true locals"" (those who grew up in the old city) and ""outsiders"" or newer residents (those in the new districts).  
- **Functional Livability (RL5)** is used to justify the superiority of the old city in terms of infrastructure, population density, and convenience, which are presented as key indicators of a ""real"" or desirable local area.  
- **Cultural Recognition (RL4)** is invoked to distinguish the old city from the new, emphasizing the importance of cultural heritage and local character in defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses:
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** through the emotional and generational connection to the old city.
- **RL4 (Cultural Recognition)** through the emphasis on cultural ""flavor"" and local identity.

The author is expressing a personal experience and emotional evaluation of living in Meixihu for three years, noting that due to dissatisfaction (as expressed by their husband), the house was sold before the housing price dropped. The content mainly reflects a **personal experience and emotional evaluation**, not a definition or judgment of ""local identity"".

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住了3年梅溪湖"" (lived in Meixihu for 3 years) – may relate to residence history.  
- ""房价没跌的时候果断卖掉了"" (sold before the price dropped) – relates to housing price and economic decision-making.  
- ""老公吐槽了三年"" (husband complained for three years) – reflects personal dissatisfaction or evaluation of the living environment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not using these elements to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or to establish criteria for who is considered a ""local person"". The content is focused on **personal living experience and economic decision-making**, not on symbolic or evaluative standards for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author expresses a strong preference for the Beichen area, which they describe as a transitional zone between the old city and the new district. They emphasize the area's improved street conditions, short commute time to the city center, and complete amenities, all of which contribute to a comfortable living experience. This reflects the author's belief that these functional and environmental qualities make Beichen an ideal or superior local living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""街道界面没老城区那么破旧"" (the streetscape isn't as dilapidated as the old city's) refers to environmental quality and urban aesthetics.  
- ""离市中心又只需要十几分钟"" (only a dozen minutes from the city center) emphasizes transportation convenience.  
- ""配套啥都有"" (has all the amenities) reflects the completeness of living facilities.  
- ""住起来太舒服哒"" (it's so comfortable to live there) is a strong evaluative statement about the overall livability of the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these functional and environmental features to argue that Beichen is a high-quality local living area. These elements are not just described for their own sake but are used to support the idea that Beichen is a desirable or superior local area in terms of comfort and convenience, thereby contributing to the author's implicit or explicit definition of what constitutes a ""good"" local living environment.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that functional livability—such as good infrastructure, convenience, and comfort—should be a standard for evaluating the quality of a local area and, by implication, the desirability of being part of that local community.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5**, which is based on the evaluation of functional livability and environmental quality. The author uses these criteria to define what constitutes a desirable local area and implicitly supports their use in judging the value of local identity.

The author uses their **growth history** in the old city and the **social embeddedness** (familiar neighbors, community ties) as key markers of ""authentic local identity."" The contrast between the old city and the newer Meixihu area is not only about physical space but also about **cultural and emotional belonging**.

The author reflects on how their perception of what constitutes ""near"" or ""far"" in Changsha is shaped by the city's historical development and spatial structure. They contrast Changsha's small size with other provincial capitals and describe how their personal experiences with commuting and spatial proximity influence their understanding of local identity and spatial belonging. The author implicitly uses the idea of **historically sedimented spatial cognition** to define what is ""local"" and what is not, based on the **perceived boundaries of the city core** and the **habitual spatial experience** of its residents.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""根植于心中远近的标准与其他城市不同"" — indicates a **habitual spatial perception** of local boundaries.  
- ""长沙周边还没开发的时候"" — references **historical development** and **urban expansion**, which shape spatial cognition.  
- ""第一次在长沙开车一不留神就出了长沙市"" — reflects **spatial boundary perception** and how people historically defined the city limits.  
- ""最远的距离是从侯家塘到步行街"" — shows **local residents' habitual understanding of city scale**.  
- ""河西住宿舍...路上车少人也少...离家太远了"" — implies a **contrast between core and periphery**, and a **spatial hierarchy** in terms of what is considered ""local"" or ""near"".  
- ""我的附近是能双脚到达"" — emphasizes **intimate spatial cognition** and **local-scale perception** of what is ""near"" or part of the ""local"" area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical and habitual spatial cognition** to define what is considered part of the ""local"" area in Changsha. Their understanding of ""near"" and ""far"" is rooted in **collective and personal spatial memory**, shaped by the city's historical development and the **socially accepted boundaries** of the urban core. This reflects a **socially sedimented spatial perception** that is central to how they and others define what is ""local"".

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **habitual spatial cognition** and **historically sedimented spatial boundaries** as key to defining what is considered ""local"". The contrast between core and periphery, and the idea that ""local"" is what is within walking distance or familiar to daily life, are all based on this **socially shared spatial logic**.

The author uses a colloquial and mocking tone to refer to people from the ""second ring"" as ""乡里"" (rural/countryside folks), implying that they are not considered ""true locals"" or are viewed with some degree of cultural or social distinction. The phrase suggests a boundary between urban and non-urban residents based on regional perception and cultural identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环的乡里"" (rural folks from the second ring) implies a regional identity boundary and cultural differentiation.  
- The use of ""乡里"" (rural) in reference to a specific urban area suggests a habitual or socially accepted perception of who is considered ""local"" and who is not.  
- The tone implies a distinction between urban and suburban or peripheral areas, reflecting a socially constructed local identity hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reinforcing a shared perception that people from the second ring are not considered ""urban"" or ""true locals,"" which reflects a vernacular spatial authority in defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that people from certain areas (the second ring) are not seen as ""urban"" or ""local"" due to a habitual and socially accepted regional perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author is using a shared, habitual perception of regional identity to distinguish between ""urban locals"" and those from the periphery, implying that the latter are not considered ""true"" locals.

The author reflects on their identity and the perception of their relocation from the urban core (Wuyi Square) to a newer or less developed area (Meixihu). The parents’ mocking comment (""to the countryside, a place no birds would go"") implies a cultural or spatial hierarchy, where the new area is not considered part of the ""true"" urban or local core. The author is indirectly expressing how **spatial perception and historical urban identity** shape what is considered a ""local"" or ""desirable"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候在五一广场出生长大的"" (Born and raised in Wuyi Square) reflects **family rootedness and long-term settlement in the urban core**.
- ""爸妈说我是到乡里去了"" (My parents say I moved to the countryside) reflects **a generational or habitual spatial perception** that Meixihu is not part of the ""real city.""
- ""鸟不拉屎的地方"" (a place no birds would go) is a colloquial expression that **stigmatizes the area as peripheral or not ""local"" enough**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s upbringing in Wuyi Square and the parents’ perception of Meixihu as a ""countryside"" area reflect **a habitual spatial hierarchy** in defining what is ""local"" or ""urban."" The generational view that certain newer or suburban areas are not part of the ""true"" city reinforces the idea of **socially sedimented regional cognition** in determining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses or reflects a **socially conventional regional cognition** (RL1), where the core urban area (Wuyi Square) is seen as the ""real"" local space, and newer or peripheral areas like Meixihu are not yet recognized as part of the ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

They also criticize the perception that the old city is more comfortable or less congested, suggesting that this belief is based on outdated or unfounded assumptions. The author is implicitly rejecting the idea that being in the old city automatically means being ""local"" or having superior living conditions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""What counts as the old city?"" (么子叫老城区咯) introduces a question about spatial categorization and conventional definitions.  
- Mentioning ""Houjiatang counts as the old city?"" (侯家塘算不？) implies the author is challenging or questioning the social habit of defining the old city.  
- ""You go check Tianjian Road there, it might not be very comfortable to live there"" (你去看看天剑路那里，那未必住起蛮舒服？) suggests the author is questioning the functional livability and comfort of areas labeled as ""old city.""  
- ""A phrase like 'the old city doesn't have traffic jams,' I don’t know where that sense of superiority comes from"" (还一句言老城区不堵车，不晓得哪里来的优越感) criticizes the symbolic ranking or perceived superiority of the old city, implying that this is a socially constructed idea rather than an objective fact.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is rejecting the idea that the ""old city"" is inherently better or more ""local,"" and is challenging the symbolic ranking and functional assumptions that underpin such a belief. They question the social convention of defining the old city and its supposed superiority in terms of comfort and livability.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **explicitly resisting** the conventional spatial authority of the old city (RL1), and is **challenging** the functional livability assumptions (RL5) that are often used to justify the superiority of the old city. However, since the author is **resisting** rather than endorsing these criteria, **only RL1 is relevant** as the author is reacting to and rejecting the **socially conventional spatial cognition** that defines the old city as the core ""local"" area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's **rejection of a conventional spatial authority** (RL1), where the old city is assumed to be the core or superior local area. The author challenges the legitimacy of this spatial categorization and the symbolic superiority it implies.

The author is explaining why they or others consider a particular area to be ""local"" or part of the core city. The reasoning is not based on complex or rational criteria, but on **habit**, **familiarity**, and **practical connections**—such as where family, friends, and work are located. The author also draws a boundary for what counts as the ""city"" by stating that ""the southernmost is not Nan'erhuan (Second Southern Ring Road), but at most Labor Road,"" implying a shared understanding of the city's core area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""就是习惯了啊"" (it's just a habit) implies a long-standing **social habit or conventional regional cognition**.  
- ""家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在"" (family, friends, and work are also there) suggests **deep social embeddedness and rootedness** in the area.  
- ""南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路"" (the southernmost is not Nan'erhuan, but at most Labor Road) clearly demarcates a **geographical boundary** that is considered the limit of the ""city"" in the author's or the community's perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **habitual regional cognition** and **social embeddedness** as the basis for defining what counts as the ""local"" area and who is part of the local community. The geographical boundary mentioned reinforces this by showing how the community collectively defines the core city area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is correcting a misconception, likely in response to a previous statement that treated the Xiangjiang New Area as an administrative region. The author asserts that the Xiangjiang New Area is a **functional area**, not an administrative one, and explains that it operates under a **""district-government integration"" (区政合一)** system with the Yuelu District Party Committee and Government. This reflects a clear emphasis on **administrative legitimacy** as a standard for defining local identity or regional status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xiangjiang New Area is a functional area, not an administrative region"" directly refers to the **administrative status** of the area.
- ""Yuelu District Party Committee and Government operate in a district-government integration model"" reinforces the **administrative legitimacy** framework for defining jurisdiction and identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the **administrative legitimacy** framework to correct the perception of the Xiangjiang New Area's status, implying that **only areas with formal administrative status should be considered in the context of local identity** or regional belonging. This shows a clear endorsement of **administrative boundaries and official designations** as the standard for defining what constitutes a ""local"" area.

- ""地图上是显示岳麓区还是湘江新区"" (whether the map shows Yuelu District or Xiangjiang New Area) implies a **geographical identity** and **administrative legitimacy** distinction.
- ""湘江新区只是经济发展上的特殊区划，又不是行政区划"" (Xiangjiang New Area is only a special economic zone, not an administrative division) clearly distinguishes **administrative legitimacy** from **economic zoning**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **explicitly rejecting** the idea that Xiangjiang New Area should be treated as an administrative entity for the purpose of defining local identity. The argument is based on **official administrative boundaries** (Yuelu District) as the **legitimate standard** for determining who or what is ""local"" in terms of jurisdiction and identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **official administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as the standard for defining local identity and geographic belonging. The author **resists** using economic special zones (like Xiangjiang New Area) as a basis for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text **strongly aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as the author is using **official administrative boundaries** to determine who or what is considered ""local.""

Output: RL2"
确实，湘江新区只是个功能区，行政区还是叫岳麓区，湘江新区相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方,RL2,"  
The author clarifies the distinction between administrative divisions and functional zones, specifically stating that ""湘江新区"" (Xiangjiang New District) is a functional area and not an administrative region, which is still officially called ""岳麓区"" (Yuelu District). The author also notes that the Xiangjiang New District encompasses parts of Yuelu and Wangcheng Districts.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Emphasis on the distinction between **functional area** and **administrative division**.
- Use of **""still called Yuelu District""** to highlight the administrative legitimacy of identity.
- The author's explanation implies that **local identity** is still rooted in the **administrative region** rather than the newer functional zone.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining local identity. Even though the Xiangjiang New District is a prominent and functional area, the author maintains that the **true administrative identity** of the region is still Yuelu District, which reflects a belief in the primacy of **official administrative boundaries** in defining local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the **administrative legitimacy** standard in defining local identity, as the functional zone is not considered a valid administrative or identity marker in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL2**, as it uses **administrative legitimacy** as the basis for defining the identity and legitimacy of the local area.

范围大点只有天心区算城区，其他都是乡里别比如雨花区，我就住这，以前全是菜地，我老公土生土长的坡子街人，他说老城区只有坡子街那一块小破地，什么开福区雨花区都没人住的荒郊野地，更别说河西的岳麓区啊跳马啊望城了，那更加不算,"RL1, RL3","  
The author clearly defines what they consider to be the ""real urban area"" (城区) versus the ""rural"" or ""non-core"" areas. They assert that only **Tianxin District** is the real urban area, and even within that, only a small part (Pozie Street) counts as the ""old city"" or ""true local area."" Other districts like **Kaifu, Yuhua, Yuelu, Tiaoma, Wangcheng** are explicitly dismissed as not being part of the ""real city."" The author's husband, who is ""born and raised in Pozie Street,"" reinforces this view. This reflects a **strong spatial hierarchy** and **historical-local perception** of what constitutes a ""local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只有天心区算城区"" (Only Tianxin District counts as urban area) → spatial boundary demarcation.  
- ""坡子街那一块小破地"" (that small, run-down area of Pozie Street) → historical core area.  
- ""开福区雨花区都没人住的荒郊野地"" (Kaifu and Yuhua are uninhabited wastelands) → spatial evaluation.  
- ""我老公土生土长的坡子街人"" (my husband was born and raised in Pozie Street) → generational rootedness.  
- Implicitly, the author and her husband share a **shared regional perception** of what constitutes the ""true"" local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **spatial boundary definitions**, **historical local perceptions**, and **generational rootedness** to define what is and is not part of the ""true"" local area. This includes:  
- A **demarcation between urban and non-urban** based on administrative or historical understanding (RL1).  
- A **generational and rootedness-based** claim of ""true local"" identity (RL3).  

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **strongly endorses** both **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority) and **RL3** (Family Rootedness) as criteria for defining ""local people"" and ""local areas."" The spatial demarcation and generational rootedness are central to the author's definition of ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1** is clearly present: The author uses a **historically sedimented perception** of spatial boundaries (e.g., Tianxin as the only ""real"" urban area, Pozie Street as the ""old city"") to define what counts as ""local.""  
- **RL3** is also present: The husband being ""born and raised in Pozie Street"" is used as a **generational rootedness** criterion to affirm ""true local"" status.

小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，然后去了捞刀河，接着又住到暮云，最后住到了梅溪湖，变成了xlb 哈哈哈哈哈哈,RL3,"  
The author humorously recounts their life journey of moving through multiple neighborhoods in Changsha, from ""南门口"" (Nangangmen) to ""梅溪湖"" (Meixihu), and ends with the phrase ""变成了xlb"" (""became xlb""), where ""xlb"" is a slang term for someone who is no longer considered a ""true local"" due to having lived in many different areas or not having deep roots in the city. The author is self-deprecatingly acknowledging their lack of deep, generational ties to a single local area, and thus their ""local identity"" is being questioned or playfully mocked in this context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author describes their **individual growth history**, moving from one area to another at different life stages.  
- The final reference to ""xlb"" (a term often used to describe someone who is not a ""true local"" due to lack of generational roots or deep ties) implies a **judgment or self-judgment** based on **family rootedness** and **long-term settlement** in a single area.  
- The narrative structure itself emphasizes the **lack of deep, generational ties** to a specific area, which is a key criterion for local identity in the context of the author's self-awareness and the slang used.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on how their **lack of long-term, generational settlement in one area** (i.e., frequent relocations) has affected their **local identity**. The use of ""xlb"" shows that in the local cultural context, **long-term, generational ties to a place** are considered a key standard for being recognized as a ""true local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly acknowledges the **importance of generational settlement** in defining ""local identity,"" even if it's in a humorous or self-deprecating way. The phrase ""变成了xlb"" clearly reflects an understanding and acceptance of the local social logic that **long-term, rooted settlement is essential for local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness (家族历史根基/个体成长史)**, as the author is using their **individual growth history** and **lack of deep generational ties** to a single area as a self-reflective criterion for local identity. The use of ""xlb"" further reinforces the **cultural expectation** that **deep, long-term roots** in a place are essential for being considered a ""true local.""

Output: RL3"
哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,RL1,"  
The author is mocking or contrasting the speaker by suggesting that they are ""rural"" (""乡里别"") and not ""urban"" (""城里人""). This implies a clear distinction between ""rural people"" and ""urban people,"" with the latter being considered more legitimate or superior in terms of local identity or social status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""乡里别"" (rural, country bumpkin) implies a negative or stigmatized identity label for non-urban residents.  
- ""城里人"" (urban people) is used as a positive or superior identity label, suggesting a standard of local legitimacy.  
- The contrast between the two identities is used to define who is ""local"" or who is not, based on urban/rural origin.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the contrast between rural and urban identity to implicitly define ""local people"" as those who are urban-dwelling or urban-born, with rural residents being excluded from or devalued in the local identity system.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""urban"" (城里人) is a marker of local legitimacy, while being ""rural"" (乡里别) is not. This is a spatially and socially symbolic distinction used to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as it reflects a socially sedimented spatial boundary between ""urban"" and ""rural"" used to define who is considered a legitimate local. The term ""城里人"" carries symbolic value and is used to distinguish the ""true"" local from outsiders or lower-status residents.

我在五一广场 有个同事不知道我们经理就是那个月亮岛那里的，然后他就说乡里别 然后我们经理就说那里已经属于是开发区了，不属于是乡里了，然后我同事还没理解意思，一直在吐槽那里不好不好，结果我们经理就背后面针对他，懂得都懂,RL2,"  
The author recounts a conversation where a colleague refers to a place (月亮岛, Moon Island) as “乡里” (rural/peasant area), and the manager corrects this by stating that the area is now part of the **development zone** (开发区), thus no longer considered “乡里.” The author highlights the **changing administrative or spatial status** of the area and the **social perception shift** associated with it. The colleague’s misunderstanding and the manager’s reaction suggest a **value judgment based on spatial status**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The colleague’s use of “乡里” reflects a **traditional spatial perception** (rural vs. urban).  
- The manager’s correction that the area is now a **development zone** implies a **change in administrative or spatial legitimacy**.  
- The colleague’s continued negative evaluation of the area and the manager’s disapproval suggest **social perceptions tied to spatial legitimacy**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author illustrates how **changing administrative status** (development zone) alters **local identity perceptions** and social value. The manager’s correction implies that **administrative legitimacy** is used to redefine what counts as a legitimate or desirable part of the city, and thus who might be considered part of the “local” or urban group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as a key factor in redefining local identity and spatial value. The manager’s correction is presented as a socially accepted or legitimate update to the area’s status, and the colleague’s outdated view is portrayed as incorrect or out of touch.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as the author conveys that the **official designation** (development zone) is used to redefine the area’s legitimacy and local status.

住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,"RL3, RL6","  
The author states that people who live in Beizheng Street are considered ""urban villagers"" or ""city people with rural roots"" (乡里别中的城里人). This implies a layered local identity that combines urban residency with a rural background, suggesting a social hierarchy or symbolic distinction within the urban context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""乡里别中的城里人"" (urban villagers or city people with rural roots) combines both spatial and social identity markers.  
- The author is distinguishing between different types of ""city people,"" based on their background or origin.  
- The phrase suggests that even though these people live in the city, they are still associated with rural origins, which affects their local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using **family rootedness** (RL3) and **social embeddedness** (RL6) to define a type of local identity. The term ""乡里别中的城里人"" implies that these individuals have a rural background (possibly generational or ancestral) and are now living in the city, but are still perceived differently from those with a purely urban lineage. This distinction may reflect a symbolic or social hierarchy in how local identity is constructed.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not explicitly opposing the idea that people from rural backgrounds living in the city are considered a different type of ""city person."" The statement reflects a commonly accepted or observed social categorization, which aligns with how local identity is socially constructed based on **family background** and **urban/rural origin**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The phrase ""乡里别中的城里人"" implies that the author (or the broader social perception being described) defines a type of local identity based on **family rootedness** (rural background) and **social embeddedness** (urban residency with rural ties). These are both significant in how local identity is socially constructed and evaluated.

Output: RL3, RL6"
