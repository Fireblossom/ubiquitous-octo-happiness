热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,RL1,"  
The author expresses pride and optimism about the北门 (Northern Gate) area, particularly 北三环 (Northern Third Ring Road), suggesting it is already better than other areas beyond the Third Ring Road and will become even better after further development (e.g., 火北). The phrase ""咱叙北第一带盐人"" (our Xubei's first salt代言人) is a pun on ""代言人"" (spokesperson), implying a sense of local belonging and endorsement.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""北三环"" (Northern Third Ring Road) is emphasized as a superior spatial zone compared to other areas beyond the Third Ring Road.
- ""东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" (Eastern and Western Third Ring may not be as good as Northern Third Ring) implies a spatial hierarchy based on habitual or emerging local perceptions.
- The author's use of ""咱"" (we) and pride in 北门 (Northern Gate) indicates an emotional or identity-based attachment to the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses spatial cognition and habitual comparison to define 北三环 as a superior sub-area within the broader ""local"" space. This reflects a shared or emerging emotional and symbolic understanding of 北三环 as a distinct and valuable part of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses 北三环 as a special and superior local area, based on habitual spatial cognition and emotional attachment. There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or occupation as defining criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a definition of local identity based on shared, habitual spatial perception and emotional attachment to 北三环 as a distinct and superior local zone — a hallmark of **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL4, RL7","  
The author is sharing multiple personal observations and experiences—both offline and online—where certain self-identified ""local"" Chengdu people (who they call ""土著"" or ""natives"") use various symbolic boundaries to distinguish themselves from others. These include mocking others as ""弯脚杆"" (a derogatory term), making fun of accents, and asserting that only those within the Second Ring Road are ""real Chengdu,"" while those outside are just ""Sichuan."" The author also mentions how online discussions about customs like dowry are used to reinforce a sense of local superiority.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Geographical Boundary Cognition:** ""二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川"" (Only within the Second Ring Road is Chengdu; outside is just Sichuan) — a clear spatial boundary used to define ""local.""
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition:** Mocking others' accents and using dialect as a boundary marker.
- **Social Identity Hierarchy:** Use of derogatory terms like ""弯脚杆"" and ""乡坝头"" to label others as rural or non-local.
- **Online Identity Performance:** The author mentions social media behavior (e.g., on Douyin) where people use linguistic and cultural traits to exclude others from local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not directly expressing their own belief, but rather describing how certain self-identified ""locals"" (especially those who claim to be ""土著"") use **multiple overlapping criteria**—spatial, linguistic, and cultural—to construct a hierarchy of local identity. These are not just descriptions of others' behavior; the author is **highlighting and implicitly critiquing** the logic these people use to define who is and isn't ""local."" However, the **core focus is not on the author’s personal endorsement**, but on **what standards are being used by others to define local identity**.

Since the task is to identify **what significant criteria the author themselves explicitly endorse or implicitly convey** as being used to define ""local people,"" we must determine whether the author is **endorsing** or **reproducing** these standards.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** the criteria used by others (e.g., the Second Ring Road boundary, accent mockery, or derogatory terms).
- However, the author **implicitly conveys these criteria as being used by self-identified locals** to define ""local identity,"" and the **text is framed as a critique or observation of such exclusionary practices**.
- Therefore, the author is **reproducing the logic** used by others to define local identity, even if not explicitly endorsing it. Since the task includes **implicit conveyance** of criteria, and the author is **describing how local identity is being constructed by others**, this still qualifies for annotation **as long as the criteria are clearly used in the text to define local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The idea that ""only within the Second Ring Road is Chengdu"" is a socially accepted spatial boundary that reflects local perception of core vs. peripheral identity.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** Mocking accents and using dialect as a boundary marker between locals and outsiders.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The use of derogatory terms like ""弯脚杆"" and ""乡坝头"" implies a symbolic association between rural identity (and by extension, occupation or lifestyle) and being non-local.

While RL3 (Family Rootedness) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness) are not explicitly or implicitly present, and RL5 (Functional Livability) is not used to define local identity in this context, the text clearly reflects **RL1**, **RL4**, and **RL7** as standards used by others to define ""local people,"" and the author implicitly conveys these as part of their critique.

Output: RL1, RL4, RL7"
我是都江堰的，其他地方的我不敢说，但是我可是从小被成都口音嘲笑哦，我小时候去亲戚家耍过暑假，我说吃饭他们就笑我口音，现在去成都我都不敢开腔，有时候买东西都说普通话，经历过很多次被恶意学我说话,RL4,"  
The author identifies as from **Dujiangyan**, and explicitly describes **negative experiences of being mocked for their accent** by people from Chengdu. This leads to a sense of **linguistic insecurity** and self-censorship (""I dare not speak"" in Chengdu, using Mandarin instead). The author implies that **speaking with a Chengdu accent or being able to pass linguistically is a de facto standard for being accepted as local**, and their own **non-Chengdu accent marks them as an outsider**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从小被成都口音嘲笑"" (mocked for not having a Chengdu accent since childhood)  
- ""说吃饭他们就笑我口音"" (they laughed at my accent when I said 'eating')  
- ""现在去成都我都不敢开腔"" (now I dare not speak when I go to Chengdu)  
- ""买东西都说普通话"" (speak Mandarin when buying things)  
- ""被恶意学我说话"" (others maliciously imitate my way of speaking)

These all point to **linguistic-cultural recognition (or exclusion)** based on accent and dialect.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's experience shows that **accent functions as a boundary marker for local identity**, where **not speaking with the local accent results in exclusion, mockery, and self-censorship**. This implies that **linguistic-cultural recognition is a standard used by locals (Chengdu people) to distinguish insiders from outsiders**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is **on the receiving end of exclusion**, they **implicitly acknowledge** that **accent is a criterion used by locals to judge who belongs**. Even though the author does not personally endorse this exclusionary logic, the **text itself conveys that linguistic-cultural recognition (or its absence) is used by locals to define local identity**.

This fits the RL4 framework, which focuses on **how language (especially dialect or accent) is used as a marker of local identity**, whether by the speaker themselves or by others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a **boundary marker** for local identity, where **accent is used to exclude or marginalize non-local speakers**, even within the broader Chengdu region. The author's experience of being mocked and self-censoring shows that **accent is treated as a key criterion for being accepted as a ""local""**.

Output: RL4"
那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,RL4,"  
The author expresses frustration and disdain toward someone who emphasizes their ""local"" background—specifically, having lived within the Second Ring Road and in a well-known local area (Kuanzhai Alley, 宽窄巷子)—as a form of social distinction or pretentiousness (""装b""). The author contrasts this with their own use of a local dialect (都江堰话), which they say is more often mocked, suggesting a critique of how certain people assert superior ""local"" status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **都江堰话被笑的更多** (""speaking Dujiangyan dialect gets laughed at more"") → linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).
- **家住二环以内**, **宽窄巷子的** (""lived within the Second Ring Road"", ""lived in Kuanzhai Alley"") → vernacular spatial authority (RL1), as these are symbolic spatial claims used to assert ""true local"" status.
- The speaker's **negative reaction** to this pretentiousness suggests they do **not** endorse using these spatial claims as valid standards for local identity, but they **do** imply that **others do use** these standards.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author is **critical** of using certain spatial markers (like living in a historically core area) to assert local superiority, they **acknowledge that others use these standards**. Importantly, the author also **identifies with a local dialect** that is mocked, which implies they **do identify as local**, but **reject the idea that certain spatial claims make someone more local**.

However, for RL annotation, the **author’s own stance** is what matters. The author **does not endorse** RL1-based spatial claims—they **mock** those who do. Instead, they **implicitly align with linguistic markers** (their dialect) as a **more authentic** or **inclusive** basis for local identity, even though it is socially looked down upon.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL1** is **not endorsed** by the author; it is **resisted**.
- **RL4** is **endorsed implicitly** by the author as a **marker of their own identity**, even though it is **socially devalued**—which is still relevant for defining ""local identity"" from their perspective.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, because the author identifies with a local dialect (Dujiangyan话), which they see as part of their local identity, even though it is mocked by others. The author **implicitly endorses linguistic identity** as a legitimate basis for being considered local, despite social stigma.

Output: RL4"
那证明成都人的确不咋地，本来成都话口音离普通话语区就够偏了，很多怪音，他们还歧视本省的人，无语了都，儿化音就像大舌头一样，这是外地人评价的，为什么有些区县的来到成都要模仿他们的口音，本来就难听还要模仿是自己也不自信，大胆保持自己的地方本土特色有什么？,RL4,"  
The author is criticizing what they perceive as the phonocentric attitude of some Chengdu locals who, despite having a dialect that is already quite distinct from Standard Mandarin (with many ""怪音"" or unusual sounds and strong ""儿化音"" or rhotacized pronunciation), still discriminate against other Sichuanese from different districts or counties. The author finds this attitude illogical and expresses frustration that some people from other areas in Sichuan try to imitate the Chengdu accent, which the author considers unpleasant. The author implicitly advocates for maintaining one's own local linguistic identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Linguistic features:** ""成都话口音"" (Chengdu dialect accent), ""儿化音"" (rhotacization), ""模仿口音"" (imitating accent), ""怪音"" (weird sounds), ""大舌头"" (lisping) — these are all references to dialect and accent.
- **Cultural-linguistic exclusion:** The author notes that Chengdu locals ""歧视本省的人"" (discriminate against people from the same province), using accent as a boundary marker.
- **Assertion of local linguistic identity:** The author questions why people would abandon their own local speech and encourages maintaining ""地方本土特色"" (local cultural characteristics), indicating a belief in the legitimacy of non-Chengdu Sichuanese accents.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a strong argument about **who is considered a legitimate local**—specifically, that linguistic differences (i.e., accents) are being misused by some Chengdu locals to exclude others from the ""local"" identity, even though those locals themselves speak a highly non-standard dialect. The author resists this form of **linguistic exclusion** and affirms the value of maintaining one's own local speech.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **linguistic diversity and local speech authenticity** as valid forms of local identity, while explicitly **rejecting the use of Chengdu dialect accent as a criterion for judging local belonging**. However, the author's critique is based on the fact that others **do** use accent as a standard for defining local identity, and the author's own stance is that such a standard is flawed. Still, the **central issue in the text is the use of linguistic-cultural features (specifically accent) to define local identity boundaries**, which is the focus of the author's argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, because the author is engaging with the idea that **accent and dialect are being used by some Chengdu locals as a boundary marker for ""local identity""**, even though the author critiques that logic. The fact that the author is responding to this linguistic exclusion implies that it is a **real and perceived standard** in local identity discourse.

Output: RL4"
我朋友都江堰人在成都十多年现在已经是成都口音了，我估计是她怕融入不了所以就变成那样了吧,RL4,"  
The author is describing a friend who moved from Dujiangyan to Chengdu over a decade ago and now speaks with a Chengdu accent. The author speculates that this linguistic shift may be due to the friend's fear of not being able to integrate, implying that speaking with a local accent is seen as a way—or even a necessity—to be accepted as part of the local group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""都江堰人"" (from Dujiangyan) indicates the friend's non-local origin.  
- ""十多年"" (over a decade) suggests long-term residence, which could imply integration.  
- ""已经是成都口音了"" (now speaks with a Chengdu accent) shows linguistic adaptation.  
- The author's speculation that the friend changed her accent ""怕融入不了"" (to avoid being excluded) implies that accent is viewed as a key factor in being accepted as a local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author sees linguistic adaptation—specifically, adopting a Chengdu accent—as a response to social pressure or a strategy for social inclusion. This implies that language (accent) is a key boundary marker for local identity in this context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that speaking with a local accent is a criterion for integration and acceptance into the ""local"" group. Although the author is describing someone else’s behavior, they do not reject the logic behind it, and the framing suggests they accept that linguistic-cultural recognition plays a role in defining who is considered a local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author implies that accent functions as a key marker of local identity and that adapting to it is necessary for social integration.

Output: RL4"
我也都江堰的，被别个说口音难听,RL4,"  
The author states, ""我也都江堰的"" (I'm also from Dujiangyan), asserting their local identity. They then mention being told that their accent is unpleasant, which implies that despite their self-identification as local, others may question or mock their local belonging based on linguistic features.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""都江堰的"" (from Dujiangyan) indicates the author's geographic origin and self-identified local identity.  
- ""被别个说口音难听"" (being told their accent is unpleasant) introduces a linguistic boundary marker — accent — used by others to judge or exclude the author from being seen as ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that although they are from Dujiangyan (and thus consider themselves local), others use linguistic features (specifically, accent) to differentiate or marginalize them, suggesting that language plays a role in how ""localness"" is socially recognized.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does not explicitly endorse the use of accent as a criterion for defining local identity, they present it as a real and relevant social perception — one that others use to judge local belonging. The author's self-identification as ""from Dujiangyan"" and the mention of accent-based exclusion together imply that linguistic-cultural recognition plays a role in the social construction of local identity, even if the author resists that standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the use of linguistic features — specifically accent — as a boundary marker for local identity, aligning with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**. Although the author resists being judged by accent, they acknowledge that others use this standard, and the text centers on how linguistic features influence perceived local belonging.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈 真的 确实 因为以前的周边的确实很弯 一说话就嫌弃 其实现在也一样 土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显 但对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走,RL4,"  
The author humorously confirms that there is a strong perception of local identity based on speech accent—specifically, the clear distinction between the accent of native, inner-city residents (e.g., within the First Ring Road) and others. They also highlight that locals are very welcoming to outsiders, but still retain a strong internal sense of linguistic-cultural differentiation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一说话就嫌弃"" (dismissive as soon as someone speaks) indicates judgment based on speech.  
- ""土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显"" (natives can immediately tell you’re not from central Chengdu by your accent) directly links accent to local identity.  
- The contrast between being warm to outsiders and internally using accent to distinguish ""real locals"" shows an implicit endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly acknowledges that accent serves as a key criterion for identifying ""real Chengdu locals"" (especially those from the central area), even while expressing warmth and hospitality to outsiders. This shows that linguistic-cultural recognition is a **socially embedded boundary** for defining ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of **accent and linguistic recognition** as a standard for distinguishing true locals from others, even if they do not overtly criticize or support this standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition** logic, where dialect or accent is used as a proxy for insider/outsider status and plays a role in defining who is considered a ""real local.""

Output: RL4"
我内江的，挨着自贡方向，说话是纯正自贡口音，在成都十多年了，也在一环买了房子，直到现在我说话也是纯正自贡口音。说话就是交流，能听懂就行了，出自哪里不重要，自己有本事才是最重要的。从来不为口音是哪里而焦虑，也不需要去在意他人的看法，有这样看法的人也是肤浅，不值得交集，更不值得因此自我内耗,(no label),"  
The author clearly expresses that although they are originally from Neijiang and speak with a pure Zigong accent, they have lived in Chengdu for over a decade and even bought property within the First Ring Road. Despite this, they do not feel the need to change their accent or worry about others' perceptions, believing that personal ability is more important than regional origin or accent. The author **rejects** the idea that accent or birthplace should be used to judge someone's local identity or worth.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""Neijiang,"" ""Zigong accent"" – could relate to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- ""In Chengdu for over a decade,"" ""bought a house in the First Ring Road"" – could relate to RL6 (Social Embeddedness) or RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- ""Accent is not important,"" ""personal ability is most important"" – the author explicitly rejects accent or origin as standards for defining local identity.
- ""Don’t care where it comes from,"" ""people who have such views are shallow"" – clearly opposes using accent or origin as a marker of identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author mentions elements that could be associated with RL3, RL4, and RL6, but the **core argument is a rejection** of using these as standards to define local identity. The author emphasizes **individual ability and choice** over traditional identity markers.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author **explicitly opposes** using accent (RL4), place of origin (RL1 or RL3), or even residential integration (RL6) as standards for defining local identity. Therefore, **none of the RL criteria are endorsed** by the author.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Since the author **rejects** the use of any of the RL criteria for defining local identity, and the annotation task only includes criteria **endorsed by the author**, **no RL label applies**.

Output: (no label)"
我不内耗我也不觉得我们口音不好听，我只是觉得有些成都人笑别人很无语,RL4,"  
The author expresses a neutral and self-assured attitude toward their own identity — they do not experience internal conflict nor do they believe their accent is unattractive. However, they find it ridiculous when some ""Chengdu locals"" mock others. This implies that the author is aware of a social phenomenon where accent (a linguistic-cultural marker) is used by some to judge or exclude others from the ""local"" group, which the author subtly criticizes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我们口音"" (our accent) refers to linguistic-cultural recognition.
- ""有些成都人笑别人"" (some Chengdu people laugh at others) indicates that some locals use linguistic features (e.g., accent) to mock non-locals or those with different speech patterns.
- The author does **not** personally endorse using accent as a standard to exclude others, but they are clearly aware of this standard being used in society.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author does not personally endorse using accent as a standard for defining local identity, they are describing a prevalent logic in which **others** use linguistic-cultural features (specifically accent) to distinguish ""us vs. them"" — i.e., who counts as a ""real local."" This reflects the author's recognition of this standard, even if they do not support it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** explicitly endorse the use of accent to define local identity. However, the author **does** recognize and critique the existence of this standard in society. Since the author is **aware of and references** this logic (even if to criticize it), and since it is **used by others in the local community** to define who belongs, this can still be considered a standard that **shapes local identity boundaries** in the author's social context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural features (specifically accent)** as a boundary marker for local identity, even if the author personally resists it. Since the author is commenting on a social standard that exists and is used by others to define ""localness,"" and since the author implicitly acknowledges its role in identity construction, this qualifies under **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.

Output: RL4"
你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,(none),"  
The author is responding to a comment that criticizes their accent, using the phrase ""口音很贱"" (the accent is lowly/disgraceful). This indicates that the author feels their local identity has been mocked or judged based on linguistic features—specifically, their accent.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音"" (accent) is a clear indicator of linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The phrase ""口音很贱"" implies that the speaker's accent is being used as a marker to devalue or marginalize their local identity.
- The author's mention of this suggests that they perceive accent-based judgment as a criterion for evaluating who is considered a legitimate ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is pointing out that their accent has been used by others as a boundary marker to exclude or demean them in terms of local belonging. Although the author does not explicitly endorse this standard, they are highlighting that this logic is being used **against** them to deny their local identity. However, per the annotation principles, we only annotate standards **endorsed or implicitly accepted by the author**, not criteria used against the author that they reject.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse the idea that accent should be used to judge local identity—rather, they are criticizing or resisting it. Therefore, although the text contains a reference to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), the author is not endorsing it as a valid standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not endorse the use of accent as a criterion for local identity and is instead resisting it, **no RL category should be annotated**.

Output: (none)"
哈哈，就是，而且我有个同事达州的，他说他的口音才是正宗成都话,RL4,"  
The author is humorously pointing out that a colleague from Dazhou claims to speak ""authentic"" Chengdu dialect. This implies a discussion around **who counts as a local Chengdu person**, with **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, accent) being used as a boundary marker. The author does not explicitly endorse or reject this view but presents it as something notable or ironic.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音才是正宗成都话"" (accent is the authentic Chengdu dialect): This centers on linguistic features as a marker of local identity.  
- The colleague being from Dazhou but claiming to speak authentic Chengdu dialect introduces a contrast between **place of origin** and **linguistic identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that **accent** is being used by the colleague (and possibly others) as a **symbolic standard** for judging whether someone is a ""true local"" Chengdu person. This reflects an implicit recognition that **language**—specifically accent—is a **commonly accepted criterion** for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does not explicitly endorse the colleague’s claim, they **do not resist or negate** the idea that accent is relevant to local identity. Instead, they **highlight it as a meaningful point**, suggesting **implicit acceptance** of its role in defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the text revolves around **accent and dialect** being used to **judge insider/outsider status** in relation to local identity.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个,RL4,"  
The author uses an emotionally charged expression — “哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个” — to mock a certain type of accent, implying that it is looked down upon or socially stigmatized. Although brief, the tone is clearly evaluative and suggests that accent is being used as a boundary marker between social groups, potentially distinguishing ""locals"" from ""non-locals.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “口音很贱” (the accent is low/bad) directly references linguistic features (accent) as a basis for judgment.
- The use of laughter (“哈哈哈哈”) suggests a dismissive or mocking attitude, reinforcing the evaluative nature of the statement.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Even though the statement is short, it reflects the author's implicit endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for evaluating or categorizing people. The mocking tone implies that this accent is not ""local"" or not respected, thus functioning as a symbolic boundary for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly uses linguistic features — specifically accent — to evaluate or judge others, which is directly linked to the construction or reinforcement of local identity boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses accent as a marker to distinguish or evaluate insider/outsider status in the context of local identity.

Output: RL4"
重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小，重要是带不带口音口音改不到撒,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that what's truly important in defining local identity is not material factors like how many houses one owns or the quality of the housing (e.g., old, rundown, small), but rather whether one speaks with a local accent—and even more so, whether one can change that accent. The implication is that accent is a deep, hard-to-fake marker of local belonging, more significant than property ownership.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小"" (how many houses, where they are, whether they’re old and rundown) – refers to property ownership and housing conditions (possibly linked to RL6: Social Embeddedness).  
- ""带不带口音，口音改不到撒"" (whether one has a local accent, and whether it can be changed) – clearly points to linguistic-cultural recognition as a key identity boundary marker (RL4).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author explicitly **rejects** using property ownership or housing quality as a standard for local identity. Instead, they **endorse** accent—something deeply tied to cultural and linguistic background—as the **true marker** of local belonging. The phrase “口音改不到撒” (you can’t change your accent) reinforces this as a stable, inherent trait the author uses to distinguish locals from non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL6 elements (property)** are **explicitly dismissed** by the author as irrelevant.  
- **RL4 elements (accent)** are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as the key criterion for defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses accent as the central boundary marker to define who is truly ""local.""

Output: RL4"
还有外地人骂成都口音难听呢，逼着他来成都了？,RL4**,"  
The author is responding to the idea that some outsiders criticize the Chengdu accent, implying that such criticism is unwarranted or hypocritical. The rhetorical question “逼着他来成都了？” (Did someone force him to come to Chengdu?) suggests that if someone dislikes the local accent but still chooses to live in Chengdu, they should not mock it. This implies that **acceptance of the local dialect is part of what it means to be a local**, or at least part of the local culture one must adapt to.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “外地人骂成都口音难听” (outsiders say the Chengdu accent is unpleasant) — this references **linguistic-cultural recognition**, using accent as a marker of local identity.
- The rhetorical tone implies that **speaking or accepting the local dialect** is part of being accepted as a local or showing respect for the local culture.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending the local accent as a cultural feature and indirectly suggesting that **those who mock it have not truly integrated into the local culture**, even if they physically reside in Chengdu. This implies that **linguistic-cultural traits**, such as accent, are **used as a boundary marker between locals and outsiders**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **acceptance or use of the local dialect is a standard for evaluating integration or belonging**, even if it's not stated in a positive ""I think this is what makes a local"" way — the implication is that **disrespecting the local language disqualifies one from being fully accepted as local**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author is using **accent and attitude toward it** as a boundary marker for local identity.

我也不知道我算不算成都人，爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都，我户口在成都。但是妈妈是外地人，我爸妈都在我妈妈的城市工作。从小我跟着爸妈在我妈妈出生的城市生活，小时候放假回成都，和小朋友玩要被骂乡巴佬，所以导致我小时候不愿意回成都，一直到读研才回的成都，读完研就出国了，现在回成都快3年，不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话，总被同事说我说的四川话有口音，我也一直对成都没有认同感。,RL4,"  
The author is in a state of **identity confusion**—they are questioning whether they can be considered a ""Chengdu person."" They list several objective conditions: their father, grandparents, and hukou (household registration) are all tied to Chengdu, indicating **administrative legitimacy** and **family rootedness**. However, due to growing up in another city (their mother's hometown), they lack emotional and cultural attachment to Chengdu, especially in terms of **language use and identity认同感 (identity认同感)**. They were even **mocked as a ""rustic"" (乡巴佬)** when visiting Chengdu as a child, reinforcing their sense of exclusion. Now back in Chengdu, they struggle with the local dialect and face **linguistic mockery** again, which further weakens their sense of belonging.  

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative belonging (RL2):** ""我户口在成都"" (My hukou is in Chengdu)  
- **Family rootedness (RL3):** ""爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都"" (My father is from Chengdu, my grandparents also live in Chengdu)  
- **Linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4):** ""不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话"" (Not very fluent in Chengdu dialect, understand it but prefer to speak Sichuan-accented Mandarin), ""总被同事说我说的四川话有口音"" (Colleagues often mock my Sichuan-accented Mandarin)  
- **Emotional distance and lack of认同感:** The author explicitly states ""一直对成都没有认同感"" (I've always lacked a sense of identification with Chengdu)

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **reflecting on the criteria for being considered a ""local""**, especially in the context of **mixed family background**, **growing up outside the city**, and **linguistic and emotional disconnection**. While they **technically meet administrative (RL2) and family (RL3) criteria**, they are **excluded in practice due to linguistic-cultural (RL4) and emotional factors**. The author's personal experience suggests that **administrative and family criteria alone are not sufficient** to define a sense of ""local"" identity—they are still judged and excluded based on language and cultural habits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not explicitly endorse any single criterion** as sufficient for defining ""local identity."" Instead, they **implicitly critique the limitations of administrative and family-rootedness criteria**, showing how **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** and **emotional认同感** are **critical in actual social practice** for being accepted as ""local.""

However, since the task requires identifying **criteria the author themselves endorse or implicitly convey** as defining ""local identity,"" we must focus on what the author **does convey as valid** in the social context they experienced.

- The author **implicitly accepts** that **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** plays a **key role in how local identity is judged socially**, even if they personally find it painful or unjust.
- The author also **accepts the administrative and family-rootedness criteria as factual**, though they are **insufficient for emotional认同感**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** as a **socially enforced standard** for defining local identity. The author's experience of being mocked for their accent and lack of fluency in Chengdu dialect shows how **language is used as a boundary marker** for ""localness"" in social practice.

While RL2 and RL3 are mentioned as factual background, they are **not framed by the author as sufficient or endorsed as the core criteria** for local identity. The author's **emotional distance** and **lack of认同感** further indicate that **local identity is not just about administrative or family status, but about cultural and linguistic integration.**

Output: RL4"
一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,RL4,"  
The author is expressing frustration and a sense of marginalization due to being targeted online, seemingly because of their **accent** (""一个口音"") and perhaps their **appearance or demeanor** (""一个面"" — possibly implying they ""look like"" outsiders). The phrase ""we are net-bullied every day, afraid to go out"" suggests that these characteristics are being used by others to exclude or mock them as not being ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一个口音"" (an accent): Points to linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker.
- The context implies that this accent is not considered ""local,"" leading to discrimination.
- The author does not explicitly endorse the logic of exclusion but is describing how **others use accent as a criterion** to judge who is or isn't local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author is not endorsing the use of accent as a standard for defining ""local people,"" they are **highlighting that others use it to exclude them**. This fits within the **functional role** of linguistic-cultural recognition in defining local identity — even if the author is resisting that standard rather than endorsing it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is **not endorsing** the use of accent as a criterion. However, the text **does reflect that such criteria are actively used in the social context** to judge ""localness,"" which is relevant for identifying RL4. Since the author is **describing the logic used by others** (even if they resent it), and not explicitly rejecting it, it may still be considered part of the symbolic ranking logic in play.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects how **accent** is used in the social context as a boundary marker for ""local"" identity, even if the speaker resists it. This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the logic is present and operative in the discourse, even if not personally endorsed.

Output: RL4"
就是。。。基本上现在接到那些骚扰电话都是外地口音哎，不是歧视外地人，只是觉得如果他们回老家，做点其他工作，也比鼓捣留在成都打骚扰电话好嘛,RL4,"  
The author expresses frustration with receiving nuisance calls from people with non-local accents. While they explicitly state ""not wanting to discriminate against outsiders,"" they still imply a connection between accent (i.e., non-local origin) and undesirable behavior (making nuisance calls). The author suggests that these individuals would be better off returning to their hometowns rather than staying in Chengdu to engage in such activities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地口音"" (non-local accent) — relates to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- The author links accent with behavior and indirectly with local belonging or legitimacy.  
- Although the author denies discriminatory intent, they still use accent as a distinguishing feature and associate it with a certain type of undesirable activity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence of a non-local accent as a marker to distinguish the callers from ""locals,"" and this distinction supports their suggestion that these individuals do not belong in Chengdu or are engaging in behavior not aligned with local norms.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Despite the disclaimer, the author implicitly uses accent — a key feature of RL4 — to identify who is considered a local or non-local, and to justify a preference for non-local individuals to leave Chengdu. This reflects an implicit endorsement of accent as a boundary marker for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with RL4 because it uses linguistic features (specifically, accent) as a way to distinguish between locals and non-locals and implicitly define local identity.

Output: RL4"
之前在成都上学遇到两个女的 就不是成都人 四川其他地方的 非要说自己是成都人 只是亲戚在双流买了房子而已各种也装的要死 我真的想问这有什么好优越的吗自己的土生土长的地方都不承认,RL3,"  
The author expresses strong disapproval toward two women from other parts of Sichuan who claim to be ""Chengdu people"" merely because their relatives bought property in Shuangliu (a district of Chengdu). The author questions the legitimacy of their claim and criticizes their behavior as pretentious. The core of the author's argument is about what **truly defines a local person**, and they clearly reject the idea that property ownership or family connections alone are sufficient.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""不是成都人"" (not Chengdu people) — the author denies the local identity of these individuals.
- ""四川其他地方的"" (from other parts of Sichuan) — indicates their actual origin.
- ""亲戚在双流买了房子"" (relatives bought a house in Shuangliu) — property ownership in a Chengdu district.
- ""非要说自己是成都人"" (insist on saying they are Chengdu people) — claim to local identity based on property.
- ""土生土长的地方都不承认"" (don't admit their place of origin) — criticism of denying one's rootedness, which the author sees as the true marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly opposes using property ownership or family property in a certain area as a basis for claiming local identity. Instead, they emphasize **family rootedness and upbringing in the area** as the real standard for being considered a ""local."" The author implicitly endorses **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** as the legitimate criterion and **rejects** the idea that property or superficial ties (like RL6) are sufficient.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly endorsed by the author: they criticize the individuals for not acknowledging their ""土生土长的地方"" (place where one was born and raised), implying that this is the **true standard** for local identity.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is mentioned (property ownership), but it is **explicitly rejected** by the author as a valid standard for claiming local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's argument centers on the belief that being a ""local"" is defined by being **born and raised in the place**, not by property ownership or social claims. This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, which emphasizes generational or upbringing-based legitimacy in defining local identity.

Output: RL3"
我也想说，我那个农村老板在成都买房了，经常给我说我现在也是成都本地人了，创业初成功经常在那吹嘘自己🐮逼，神戳戳的，他不在别的同事面前说他是成都户口了因为其他人不是土著,none,"  
The author is describing a rural-born boss who has bought property in Chengdu and now claims to be a ""Chengdu local."" The boss proudly asserts this new identity, especially in contrast to others who are not ""native"" locals. The author uses this anecdote to reflect on how people claim ""local"" status based on certain criteria (such as property ownership or hukou), while others still see them as outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""买房了"" (bought a house) → property ownership in the city.
- ""成都本地人"" (Chengdu local) → identity claim based on location.
- ""成都户口"" (Chengdu hukou) → administrative legitimacy.
- ""其他同事不是土著"" (other colleagues are not natives) → implies a hierarchy of local belonging.
- Implicit contrast between new migrants and ""true"" locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The boss uses **hukou** (RL2) and **property ownership** (RL6) to assert a new ""local"" identity. However, the author implies that this claim is not fully accepted by others, who still distinguish between ""true"" locals and newcomers. The author thus critiques or highlights the criteria used to define ""local people"" — especially administrative status and property ownership — suggesting that these are **used by some to claim local identity**, even if not fully recognized.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not personally endorse** the boss's claim to being a ""local,"" but **acknowledges that others use these criteria (hukou and property) to define local identity**. Therefore, these are **not criteria the author personally endorses**, but they are **criteria used by someone in the narrative to claim local identity**.

However, per the task's **core limitation**, only **criteria that the author themselves explicitly endorse or implicitly convey** as valid for defining ""local people"" should be annotated. Since the author is **skeptical or mocking** of the boss’s claim (""神戳戳的"", ""吹嘘自己🐮逼""), and implies that others do not accept it, **the author does not endorse hukou or property ownership as legitimate standards**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text discusses hukou (RL2) and property ownership (RL6), the author **does not personally endorse** them as valid criteria for defining ""local people."" Instead, the author **uses these to highlight the contested nature of local identity**, implying that such criteria are **used by others but not accepted by the speaker**.

**Therefore, no RL category should be annotated.**

Output: none"
我倒觉得是外来的多了故意在那点火，成都越扩越大本来对我爸妈这种老一辈是不好区分的，现在离成都二三环内天远地远的地方也叫成都，结果一导航开过车过来还要老半天比去隔壁几个市坐高铁时间都长还不如说原来的某某地名好记，老一辈是不习惯啊，然后就说歧视了,RL1,"  
The author expresses a view that as Chengdu expands administratively, including areas that are geographically distant (now called Chengdu, such as parts of the second and third ring roads), this creates confusion and discomfort for older generations who grew up with a more limited, traditional understanding of where ""Chengdu"" is. The author implies that this mismatch between administrative expansion and habitual spatial cognition leads to social tension, with older locals perceiving newer residents as ""outsiders"" or not truly ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""成都越扩越大"" (Chengdu keeps expanding) — administrative boundary changes.
- ""离成都二三环内天远地远的地方也叫成都"" (Places very far from the 2nd and 3rd ring roads are also called Chengdu) — reflects habitual spatial cognition and emotional mapping.
- ""老一辈是不习惯啊"" (Older generations are not used to it) — indicates generational differences in perception.
- ""就说歧视了"" (they call it discrimination) — implies identity boundary drawing and potential exclusion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not explicitly endorsing administrative legitimacy as the main standard for defining local identity, but rather highlighting a conflict between **administrative expansion** and **habitual, socially shared spatial perceptions** of where Chengdu ""truly"" is. The older generation’s discomfort reflects a **socially habitual and historically sedimented understanding of space**, which is being challenged by official boundary changes. The author seems to sympathize with this older view and implies that the mismatch leads to social exclusion or identity conflict.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author implicitly endorses the **habitual, socially shared understanding of spatial boundaries** (e.g., only areas near the 2nd and 3rd ring roads are ""real Chengdu"") as a more authentic or emotionally legitimate way to define local identity.
- Although administrative expansion (RL2) is mentioned, the author does **not** endorse it as the standard for defining local identity — rather, they critique it as a source of confusion and social tension.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text primarily reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author emphasizes a shared, habitual perception of space (limited Chengdu identity near central rings) that conflicts with formal administrative boundaries. The author implicitly endorses this habitual understanding as more aligned with local identity.

并没有啊，成都有钱的又不一定是土著，绝大部分土著只是不愁房子住，另外有多余的房子可以出租出去，所以工资那么低很多人还是过得很开心月收入足够支撑不错的生活水平了。成都人天生一副你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕各过各的谁也不碍着谁所以大家才悠然自得，那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的，多是外地赚了钱来成都消费或者安置的,"RL4, RL6","  
The author is refuting the idea that wealth equates to being a local (""土著""). They clarify that while many locals (""土著"") are not necessarily rich, they often have housing security (e.g., multiple properties for rent), which allows them to live comfortably even with low wages. The author emphasizes that this lifestyle and sense of contentment stems from being a local, not from wealth. They also distinguish locals from wealthy outsiders who come to consume or settle in the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土著"" (local people):** Used repeatedly as a category with distinct characteristics.
- **""不愁房子住，有多余的房子可以出租"" (not worried about housing, have extra houses to rent):** Indicates a form of social embeddedness (housing stability, asset-based security) tied to being a local.
- **""工资那么低很多人还是过得很开心"" (earn low wages but live happily):** Suggests a lifestyle and identity not based on income but rootedness.
- **""你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕"" (you being rich is your thing, I don't envy you):** Implies a cultural attitude or value system associated with locals.
- **""那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的"" (the wealthy areas are not for locals):** Suggests a spatial distinction and social boundary between locals and outsiders, especially wealthy ones.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author defines ""土著"" (locals) as people who have a stable, low-pressure lifestyle rooted in housing security and a cultural attitude of non-competitive contentment. This is contrasted with wealthy outsiders who bring money into the city but are not considered part of the local fabric. The author uses **housing and lifestyle rootedness** (RL6) and **cultural attitude** (linked to RL4) to distinguish locals from non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author clearly endorses **housing stability and property ownership** as a marker of local identity — locals have housing security and can rent out properties, which gives them a sense of independence and stability.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The cultural attitude of not envying the rich and living contentedly is portrayed as a **shared local value**, reinforcing the boundary between locals and outsiders.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL6:** The author emphasizes that locals have **housing assets and economic stability rooted in the local context**, which allows them to live independently and comfortably. This is a key standard used to define who counts as a ""土著.""
- **RL4:** The cultural attitude of **non-competitive contentment** is presented as a **shared value among locals**, distinguishing them from outsiders (especially wealthy ones), even if the language aspect isn't directly about dialect or accent.

Output: RL4, RL6"
我崇州的嘛 我们身边的人被问到是哪里的 都直接说崇州 不会说是成都的从小到大耳濡目染的就是成都人都觉得三环以外的不算成都的,RL1,"  
The author is expressing that people from Chongzhou identify directly as ""Chongzhou"" rather than ""Chengdu,"" and that this reflects a long-standing social perception: Chengdu people generally do not consider areas outside the Third Ring Road as truly part of Chengdu. This reflects a habitual, socially shared spatial认知 used to define local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""崇州的"" (from Chongzhou), ""直接说崇州，不会说是成都的"" (say Chongzhou directly, not Chengdu) — indicates a self-identification and a rejection of broader Chengdu identity.  
- ""从小到大耳濡目染"" (learned since childhood through social exposure) — implies this is a shared, habitual perception.  
- ""三环以外的不算成都的"" (areas outside the Third Ring Road don't count as Chengdu) — a clear spatial boundary used to define local belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these elements to show that there is a socially and historically sedimented perception of spatial boundaries that define ""localness"" — specifically, that Chongzhou is not considered part of Chengdu proper, and that Chengdu identity is confined to within the Third Ring Road. This is not about administrative boundaries or personal preference, but about shared cultural/spatial认知.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly affirms the idea that certain areas are not considered ""local"" based on shared spatial认知 — a socially constructed, habitual understanding of where ""local"" begins and ends.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author refers to a shared, habitual, and culturally sedimented understanding of spatial boundaries that define ""local"" identity, independent of administrative divisions.

Output: RL1"
话说什么是土著，我认为从爷爷辈土生土长开始才算是土著，那些从外地拿到成都户口或者父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃，然后很骄傲的弯酸，这种不算，并且所谓的成都人假打90%以上都是这种人,RL3,"  
The author is clearly defining what it means to be a ""土著"" (indigenous/local person), emphasizing that only those whose family has been rooted in Chengdu for multiple generations — specifically ""from the grandfather's generation"" — can truly be considered locals. The author explicitly excludes people who migrated from elsewhere, even if they now hold a Chengdu hukou or were born there after their parents migrated. The tone is critical of those who claim local identity without this generational rootedness.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从爷爷辈土生土长开始"" (starting from the grandfather’s generation, born and raised here) clearly emphasizes **family historical rootedness**.  
- ""拿到成都户口"" (obtained Chengdu hukou) and ""父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃"" (children born in Chengdu after their parents migrated) indicate that administrative legitimacy (RL2) and birthplace are **not** sufficient in the author's view to define ""local identity.""  
- The author's exclusionary logic is based on **generational depth of local settlement**, not legal status or place of birth.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **multi-generational family settlement** as the key criterion to distinguish ""true locals"" from ""pretenders"" or ""outsiders."" This generational rootedness is presented as the **core standard** for defining ""土著"" or ""real Chengdu people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that only those with deep family roots in Chengdu (from the grandfather's generation onward) are true locals. They **explicitly reject** administrative belonging (hukou) and birthplace as sufficient criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author defines ""local identity"" based on **multi-generational family settlement** and long-term familial ties to the area.

Output: RL3"
我觉得哪个地方的土著都会多少有点优越感吧……毕竟是土生土长本地人 对吧,RL3,"  
The author suggests that being ""native"" or ""土著"" (indigenous/local) to a place naturally comes with a sense of superiority. They justify this by referencing being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here), which implies that long-standing familial or personal roots in a place form the basis for a local identity that carries symbolic advantage.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/local people) — refers to those who have deep local ties.  
- ""土生土长本地人"" (born and raised here, local person) — clearly points to family rootedness and generational belonging.  
- ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) — implies that this identity carries symbolic or social value.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing a phenomenon but is implying that being born and raised in a place (""土生土长"") is the basis for claiming a superior local identity. This reflects a belief in generational rootedness as a legitimate and valued standard for defining ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised here"" (family rootedness) is a valid and meaningful standard for defining ""local people"" and that it naturally leads to a sense of superiority. There is no explicit resistance to this view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3 because it centers on the idea of being ""土生土长"" — born and raised in the area — as a foundation for claiming local identity and even superiority, which is a core identification feature of RL3.

Output: RL3"
我没觉得喃，每次回去都觉得多亲切的，被烧的时候一点感觉都没有，我还是土生土长成都女娃儿，一点口音都没有，一样被烧,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is expressing a personal experience of feeling unfairly targeted or criticized (""被烧""), despite being a ""native"" Chengdu resident (""土生土长成都女娃儿"") and having no noticeable accent (""一点口音都没有""). They are emphasizing that neither their deep-rooted local identity nor their linguistic conformity protected them from being singled out.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" (born and raised in Chengdu) clearly points to **family rootedness** and personal upbringing as markers of local identity.  
- ""一点口音都没有"" (no accent at all) refers to **linguistic-cultural recognition**—specifically, the ability to speak the local dialect without detectable difference.  
- ""被烧的时候一点感觉都没有"" (no sense of being targeted until it happened) implies a contrast between the author's self-perception as a local and how they were treated, possibly by others who judged ""localness"" differently.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is asserting their legitimacy as a ""local"" based on two criteria: being born and raised in Chengdu (RL3) and speaking the local dialect without an accent (RL4). They are not claiming that others used these criteria to exclude them, but rather that despite meeting these criteria, they were still treated as outsiders. This implies that the author **endorses** these as valid markers of local identity and is surprised that they didn't protect them from being ""burned"" (i.e., criticized or excluded).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Both **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** are criteria that the author **explicitly uses to define their own local identity**. They are not resisting or negating these standards; rather, they are emphasizing that they meet them fully.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **two RL categories**:
- **RL3**: The author explicitly claims to be ""土生土长"" (born and raised here), which is a core criterion in this category for defining a ""true local.""
- **RL4**: The author also emphasizes that they have no accent (""一点口音都没有""), indicating linguistic conformity, which is a key marker in this category for distinguishing locals from outsiders.

Output: RL3, RL4"
反正我三环外的不是成都人,RL1,"  
The author clearly expresses a belief that people living outside the Third Ring Road are not considered ""Chengdu people"" (本地成都人). This is a direct statement about defining local identity based on spatial perception and habitual regional cognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) is a spatial boundary marker.
- ""不是成都人"" (not Chengdu people) reflects an identity boundary tied to that spatial marker.
- The statement is a generalization, not based on administrative boundaries, family history, or other objective criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a shared spatial perception — that ""real"" Chengdu people live within the Third Ring Road — to define who belongs to the local identity. This reflects a habitual or culturally accepted way of distinguishing ""locals"" from ""non-locals"" based on geography, not law, family, or language.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that location relative to the Third Ring Road is a valid standard for determining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where shared or habitual understandings of urban space are used to define local identity, rather than formal administrative boundaries.

Output: RL1"
我同学说二环外的都是农民,RL7,"  
The author is relaying a statement made by a classmate: ""Those outside the Second Ring Road are all farmers."" This statement uses **occupation** as a symbolic label to distinguish between ""urban"" and ""non-urban"" residents, effectively drawing a boundary around who counts as a ""real city person"" or ""local."" The author does not explicitly refute or distance themselves from this view, and by presenting it as a shared or notable statement, they implicitly accept its relevance in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环外的"" (those outside the Second Ring Road) refers to a spatial boundary, but it is being used in conjunction with an occupational label.
- ""都是农民"" (are all farmers) is a strong occupational typification, using ""farmer"" as a symbolic identity marker to define people outside the urban core.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The statement functions as a symbolic boundary-drawing mechanism: by labeling people outside the Second Ring Road as ""farmers,"" it excludes them from the category of ""urban locals."" Occupation here is not just a job description but a **symbolic marker** of identity, used to differentiate between ""us"" (urban locals) and ""them"" (non-locals or rural outsiders).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not reject the statement but presents it as a shared perception (possibly even their own). Therefore, it is treated as a **criterion they endorse** for distinguishing local identity. The use of ""farmer"" as a broad, reductive occupational label is central to this distinction.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text fits **RL7: Occupational Typification**, because it uses a specific occupation (""farmer"") as a symbolic boundary to distinguish between groups and define who is or is not considered a ""local"" or ""urban"" person.

Output: RL7"
歧视三环外的多，还是学生偏多,N/A,"  
The author is posing a question about social perception: whether the bias or discrimination against people living outside the Third Ring Road is more prevalent, or whether there are simply more students living in those areas. The focus is on understanding the basis of potential social exclusion or stereotyping.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""歧视三环外的"" (discrimination against those outside the Third Ring Road) suggests a possible use of **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, where certain areas are socially devalued or excluded from the core ""local"" identity.
- ""学生偏多"" (more students) refers to demographic composition, which could be linked to **RL7 (Occupational Typification)** if the author were using ""student"" as a symbolic category to define local identity or differentiate groups.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not explicitly endorsing any standard for defining ""local identity."" Instead, they are questioning or reflecting on existing social attitudes or demographic patterns. There is no clear endorsement of area-based exclusion (RL1) or occupation-based categorization (RL7) as valid criteria for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author is posing a question rather than affirming a standard, there is **no explicit or implicit endorsement** of any RL category as a basis for defining ""local people"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Because the author does not affirm any specific standard for defining ""local identity,"" no RL category applies.

成都土著的优越感是最强的，没有之一那种。比如他们在强调自己血统纯正的时候，往往会在前面加上土著或土生土长这样的词语。外地的不用说了，还没资格让土生土长的5城区成都人看不起，有资格被看不起的，首先你要是三环外但是大成都的弯脚杆和211，或者是后面来但是获得了成都省护照的新成都。,"RL1, RL2, RL3, RL4, RL6","  
The author is describing the strong sense of superiority held by **Chengdu ""tuzhu"" (native/indigenous)** residents, particularly those from the **5 core urban districts**. This identity is tied closely to **genealogical purity** and **long-term rootedness** in Chengdu. The author further outlines a **hierarchical structure** of who is eligible to be looked down upon by ""true locals"" — indicating that only those with **some local connection** (e.g., from outer areas of Chengdu or recent arrivals with local status) can be part of this local social hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""土著"" / ""土生土长""** (native, born and raised here) — emphasizes generational rootedness.
- **""血统纯正""** (pure lineage) — implies family-rootedness and possibly cultural legitimacy.
- **""5城区""** (5 core districts) — reflects habitual spatial cognition of who counts as ""real locals"".
- **""三环外但是大成都""** (outside the 3rd Ring but still in Greater Chengdu) — implies a distinction between core and peripheral locals.
- **""弯脚杆"" / ""211""** — local slang terms used to mock or distinguish lower-status locals.
- **""成都省护照"" / ""新成都人""** — refers to those who have recently acquired local status (possibly through hukou or integration), suggesting administrative or social legitimacy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's argument revolves around **a hierarchy of local identity**, where **true localness is defined by generational rootedness**, **spatial origin**, and **possibly administrative or social integration**. The author does not explicitly resist these criteria but rather **describes and implies acceptance of this system**, even if critically. The text **affirms that these are the criteria used by locals to define and rank ""localness""**, and the author **engages with them as legitimate standards** in the discourse.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses:
- **Family rootedness** (RL3) through emphasis on ""土生土长"" and ""血统纯正"".
- **Vernacular spatial authority** (RL1) by distinguishing between 5城区 locals and those from outside the 3rd Ring.
- **Social embeddedness** (RL6) via the mention of social hierarchy and who has the ""资格"" (qualification) to be part of the local social structure.
- **Administrative legitimacy** (RL2) through the mention of ""成都省护照"" (metaphorical reference to hukou/local status).
- **Cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) via the use of local slang (""弯脚杆"", etc.) to distinguish insiders/outsiders.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text presents a **multi-layered definition of local identity**, involving **family history**, **spatial cognition**, **social hierarchy**, **administrative status**, and **cultural recognition**. All of these are **endorsed or acknowledged by the author** as criteria used to define ""local people"" in Chengdu.

成华区二环内土著 几十年了没觉得啥子,RL3,"  
The author identifies as a ""土著"" (native/indigenous person) within the Second Ring Road in Chenghua District, indicating long-term rootedness in the area. The phrase ""几十年了没觉得啥子"" (after decades, doesn't feel like anything special) suggests that the author sees this status as normal or taken-for-granted, implying an implicit identification with being a ""local"" due to long-term residence and birth in the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (native) directly implies a sense of local identity rooted in being born and raised in the area.  
- ""成华区二环内"" (within the Second Ring Road in Chenghua District) indicates a specific local spatial identity.  
- ""几十年了"" (decades) implies long-term historical presence and continuity in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly endorses long-term rootedness and being ""born and raised here"" as the basis for a local identity. The use of ""土著"" especially conveys a sense of authenticity or original belonging, even if the author downplays its significance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts and expresses the idea that being a ""local"" is defined by long-term family or personal rootedness in the area — a core feature of **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a definition of local identity based on being native to the area, with generational or long-term presence, aligning with **RL3**.

Output: RL3"
我是成都土著，我觉得还好！说实话哈，只是确确实实有一点受不了一些口音。但是不存在什么问题强强联合，成都本地人也很多撇火药哈。,RL3,"  
The author clearly identifies as a ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu person), indicating a strong sense of local identity rooted in birth and upbringing. They also express discomfort with certain accents, which implies a sensitivity to linguistic boundaries of ""localness."" However, they downplay the idea of strict exclusivity or hierarchy among locals, noting that ""there are also many Chengdu locals who are 撇火药"" — a colloquial Chengdu expression meaning ""laid-back"" or ""cool-headed,"" suggesting inclusiveness toward other locals despite differences.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu person) points to family rootedness or generational presence in the city.  
- ""受不了一些口音"" (can't stand some accents) points to linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker.  
- The overall tone is not exclusionary — the author acknowledges diversity among locals and does not insist on a rigid standard of ""purity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author mentions being bothered by some accents (RL4), this is framed as a minor personal feeling rather than a standard they actively endorse for defining ""local people."" On the contrary, the author seems to resist rigid exclusionary criteria by emphasizing the diversity and inclusiveness of Chengdu locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The discomfort with accents is not strongly endorsed as a legitimate standard for defining ""local people."" Instead, the author's identification as a ""native Chengdu person"" and their inclusive attitude suggest that they define ""local"" primarily through being born and raised in Chengdu (RL3), not through language or strict cultural exclusion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's self-identification as a ""土著"" (native) reflects a belief in long-term family rootedness and upbringing in Chengdu as the core of local identity, which aligns with RL3.

三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个,RL1,"  
The rhetorical question ""三环外的弯脚杆咋个敢嫌弃哪个"" (How dare someone from outside the Third Ring Road look down on others) implicitly challenges the legitimacy of identity-based hierarchy or exclusion by people living in peripheral areas. The term ""弯脚杆"" is a colloquial, possibly mocking term for people from outside the core urban area — those who are seen as lacking local authenticity or social standing. The author seems to reject the idea that such people have the right to judge or exclude others in terms of ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) refers to a spatial boundary, suggesting a conventional perception of who belongs to the ""real"" local core.
- ""弯脚杆"" is a vernacular term that carries both spatial and cultural connotations, often used to mock or identify outsiders.
- The rhetorical tone implies a critique of exclusionary standards of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase ""三环外的弯脚杆"" represents a socially recognized label for people who are not considered part of the core ""local"" identity. The author uses this label to question the legitimacy of their judgment or exclusionary behavior, suggesting that they themselves lack full local legitimacy. This implies that the author endorses a certain hierarchy or boundary of local belonging based on spatial origin.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts and reflects a conventional spatial hierarchy — that people from outside the Third Ring Road are not fully recognized as ""true locals"" — and uses this understanding to make a rhetorical point. This reflects an endorsement of the **socially habitual spatial认知** that certain areas (inside the Third Ring Road) are more authentically local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects and operates within a shared, habitual understanding of spatial boundaries (inside/outside the Third Ring Road) that are symbolically and socially used to define local identity.

Output: RL1"
本土著去年底刚从市中心搬到天府新区 只能说三环内土著不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人,RL1,"  
The author expresses a clear evaluative stance: while people born and raised in the inner city (三环内土著) do not discriminate against outsiders based on place of origin, they do discriminate against people from areas outside the Third Ring Road (三环外人). This reflects an identity boundary drawn not based on administrative division or migration status, but based on **habitual spatial cognition**—a socially shared perception of which areas are considered the ""core"" locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本土著"" (native/local people), ""三环内土著"" (natives within the Third Ring Road) – indicates identity based on long-standing local belonging.
- ""歧视三环外人"" (discriminate against people from outside the Third Ring Road) – implies a symbolic boundary drawn between ""us"" (inner city) and ""them"" (outer areas).
- The boundary is not administrative or economic, but **spatial and perceptual**, rooted in social habit and collective cognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author highlights that local identity is not just about being from the city or having migrated, but about **which part of the city you are from**. Inner-city residents (within the Third Ring Road) are seen as the ""true"" locals, while those from the outskirts (like Tianfu New Area) are not. This reflects a **socially habitual and symbolic spatial hierarchy**, not an official or functional one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **inner-city areas (within the Third Ring Road)** are the true local core, and that **people from outside this area are not considered true locals**, even if they are from the same city. This is a **socially habitual spatial cognition**, not based on administrative lines or individual characteristics.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses a socially shared perception of spatial hierarchy—distinguishing between ""inner city"" and ""outer areas""—to define who is considered a ""true local.""

听过同事吐槽，她老公是二环的，她家在二环也有房子，但是户口是青白江的，然后她老公的亲戚摆龙门阵就一口一个你们乡坝头咋个咋个,RL2,"  
The author is relaying a colleague's complaint about how the colleague's husband's relatives mock her for having a hukou (household registration) in Qingbaijiang, despite her owning property in the Second Ring Road area. This highlights the use of **hukou registration** as a boundary marker for local identity, where **administrative归属 (administrative affiliation)** is used to exclude or mock someone as being ""from the countryside.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""户口是青白江的"" (her hukou is in Qingbaijiang) – a clear administrative boundary marker.
- ""亲戚...一口一个你们乡坝头咋个咋个"" (relatives keep saying 'you country folks this, country folks that') – indicates identity exclusion based on administrative origin.
- ""二环也有房子"" (owns property in the Second Ring Road area) – though mentioned, it's not used as the standard for judging local identity in this context.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author presents a situation where **hukou registration** is used by others (the husband's relatives) as the standard to **exclude someone from local identity**, labeling them as ""countryside"" or non-local. Although the author is reporting others' views, they do not explicitly oppose or critique this logic; rather, they present it as a real and accepted boundary mechanism.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not personally endorse the use of hukou, but they **implicitly accept its relevance** in the local identity discourse by presenting it as a legitimate standard used by others **without refuting it**. Since the author does not negate this logic and presents it as a meaningful social boundary, it qualifies for annotation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a standard for defining local identity, where hukou registration is used to distinguish between locals and non-locals.

Output: RL2"
三环边边 不敢说是土著 走到一环二环都说进城 不敢开车 怕遭说,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a sense of not fully belonging or being recognized as a ""local"" (土著), especially when moving from the outskirts (三环边边) toward the urban core (一环二环). Phrases like ""不敢说是土著"" (dare not say I'm a native/local) and ""怕遭说"" (afraid of being criticized) imply a perceived boundary or hierarchy in local identity based on spatial location and associated social perceptions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环边边"" (on the edge of the Third Ring Road): indicates a peripheral location, possibly seen as less ""central"" or ""authentically local.""  
- ""走到一环二环都说进城"" (when I go to the First or Second Ring Road, people say I'm entering the city): reflects a perception of a core-periphery structure, where only certain areas are considered the ""real"" city.  
- ""不敢说是土著"" (dare not say I'm a native): shows self-awareness or internalization of a social perception that people from certain areas are not seen as true locals.  
- ""怕遭说"" (afraid of being criticized): implies social judgment tied to spatial identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is conveying that **where one is from spatially** (e.g., on the edge of the Third Ring Road vs. within the First or Second Ring Road) affects how one is perceived and how one perceives oneself in terms of local identity. This reflects a **socially shared perception** of which areas are ""central"" and which are ""peripheral"" in terms of local belonging — not based on administrative boundaries or personal attributes, but on **habitual, symbolic spatial cognition**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **urban spatial perception** (e.g., ""进城"" — entering the city, even from within the same city administratively) defines who is seen as a ""true local."" This aligns with the idea of **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of spatial categories**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** logic — the author is describing a **socially accepted perception** that differentiates between areas within the same city, using **symbolic spatial labels** to define who is or isn't seen as a ""true local.""

Output: RL1"
我还挺喜欢成都口音的,RL4,"  
The author expresses a personal preference for the Chengdu accent (""我还挺喜欢成都口音的""), indicating a positive emotional or identity connection to this linguistic feature. This implies that linguistic-cultural recognition — specifically, the local accent — plays a role in their perception of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a clear linguistic marker.
- The author's ""liking"" of this accent implies an emotional or identity-based attachment to this cultural feature.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's positive evaluation of the Chengdu accent suggests that linguistic features are used as a marker of cultural belonging or local identity. Although the author does not explicitly define ""local people"" based on this, the statement implies that accent plays a symbolic role in their understanding or appreciation of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses linguistic-cultural recognition — specifically, speaking with a Chengdu accent — as a meaningful component of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This statement aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as it reflects the use of accent as a symbolic boundary marker for local identity.

Output: RL4"
三环外不配，而且可能还同时被外地人歧视,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a strong evaluative stance: areas outside the Third Ring Road are not considered to have the status or legitimacy of ""true local"" areas. Additionally, the author implies that people from these areas may also face discrimination from ""outsiders"" (外地人), reinforcing a hierarchy of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外不配"" (areas outside the Third Ring Road don't deserve to be considered) implies a spatial boundary that defines who or what counts as ""local.""  
- The mention of being ""同时被外地人歧视"" (also discriminated against by outsiders) reinforces the idea that there is a socially recognized boundary or hierarchy of localness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase ""三环外不配"" clearly establishes a spatial boundary based on shared, habitual perceptions of the city’s geography. This reflects a socially accepted cognitive map that distinguishes ""core locals"" from those on the periphery. The author implicitly endorses this boundary as a standard for defining legitimate ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that areas outside the Third Ring Road are not on equal footing with the inner city in terms of local identity legitimacy. This is not merely a description of others’ views but an expression of the author’s own perception of spatial legitimacy.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses a commonly accepted spatial boundary (Third Ring Road) to define who or what ""counts"" as local, based on shared emotional or symbolic mapping of the city.

作为一环路穷土著我真没觉得我有优越感，但是遇到一部分四川其他地方的朋友就会暗戳戳地想象“她是不是有优越感”，我成都朋友在外面说个成都话，都会被不知情的人指责她学成都口音装成都人,RL4,"  
The author, identifying as a ""一环路穷土著"" (a poor native living near the First Ring Road), denies having a sense of superiority but reveals an implicit internal standard for identifying ""real locals"" — specifically, the ability to speak authentic Chengdu dialect. They also describe a social phenomenon where others may suspect or accuse someone of ""pretending to be from Chengdu"" simply for speaking the dialect, suggesting that linguistic-cultural recognition plays a key role in defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""穷土著"" (poor native): implies a sense of rootedness or native status despite economic disadvantage.  
- ""说个成都话"" (speaking Chengdu dialect): emphasizes the use of local language as a marker of identity.  
- ""被指责学成都口音装成都人"" (accused of imitating the accent to pretend to be from Chengdu): shows that speaking the local dialect is seen as a boundary marker for being considered a ""real local.""  
- The author's internalized suspicion (""暗戳戳地想象"") toward people from other parts of Sichuan indicates an implicit standard for distinguishing ""true locals"" from outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's self-identification as a ""native"" and the social tension around speaking Chengdu dialect both center on linguistic-cultural recognition as a key standard for defining who is and isn't a ""real"" local. The accusation of ""pretending to be local"" through accent imitation underscores how language functions as a symbolic boundary for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that speaking the local dialect (Chengdu话) is a key criterion for being seen — or judged — as a ""real local."" Though the author denies having superiority, they still perceive and react to the social logic that equates dialect with local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author implicitly endorses dialect and accent as key symbolic markers used to distinguish locals from outsiders, and these linguistic traits are tied to social evaluation and identity claims.

Output: RL4"
其实和成都土著关系不大，还是看个人素质，在成都呆了10多年，大部分成都土著还是很好的，以前嘿多成都嬢嬢经常给我介绍对象,(None),"  
The author is downplaying the importance of being a ""Chengdu native"" (土著) in defining local identity or determining social behavior. Instead, they emphasize individual character (""看个人素质"") as the more important standard. While they acknowledge having positive experiences with many Chengdu natives (e.g., helping with matchmaking), they do not use any of the RL criteria to define or judge ""local identity."" The author implicitly rejects the idea that being a native or possessing certain rooted traits determines local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (Chengdu native) – potentially related to RL3 (Family Rootedness)  
- ""在成都呆了10多年"" (lived in Chengdu for over 10 years) – potentially related to RL3 or RL6 (Social Embeddedness)  
- No mention of administrative division (RL2), spatial cognition (RL1), language (RL4), livability (RL5), or occupation (RL7)

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the term ""土著"" is mentioned, the author explicitly says that being a native ""其实和...关系不大"" (is not really relevant), and instead emphasizes personal qualities. The author does not endorse or imply that family history, long-term residence, or any other RL-based standard should be used to define ""local people."" The positive experiences with ""成都嬢嬢"" (local women) are described as personal interactions, not as part of a broader standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse any specific RL-based standard to define ""local identity."" Instead, they reject such categorizations and focus on individual behavior and personality.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not endorse any of the RL criteria for defining ""local identity,"" and instead rejects the relevance of being a native or long-term resident, **no RL category applies**.

Output: (None)"
怎么说呢，我老家是成都郊区的，跟父母常年住在成都的，每次别人问我，我都说我是某郊区人别人都会说：成都人哦！感觉阴阳怪气的,RL3,"  
The author expresses a sense of discomfort and perceived mislabeling when others assume they are a ""Chengdu person"" just because they live in Chengdu. Despite residing in the city with their parents, the author emphasizes their identity as someone from the **suburbs**, suggesting that they feel a distinction exists between suburban and urban ""local"" identities. The phrase ""阴阳怪气的 (sounding sarcastic or insincere)"" implies that the author feels this labeling is superficial or even mocking, and not aligned with their own sense of rootedness or local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""我老家是成都郊区的"" (My hometown is in the suburbs of Chengdu): Indicates a generational or rooted connection to a specific area outside the urban core.
- ""跟父母常年住在成都的"" (Have lived in Chengdu with my parents for years): Reflects long-term residence in the city, but not necessarily the urban core.
- ""我都说我是某郊区人"" (I always say I’m from a certain suburb): Emphasizes self-identification with a specific suburban area rather than the broader city.
- ""别人都会说：成都人哦！"" (Others would say: You’re a Chengdu person!): Indicates a mismatch between the author’s self-identity and how others socially categorize them.
- The emotional tone (""阴阳怪气的"") suggests that the author feels the label ""Chengdu person"" is applied too loosely and doesn't reflect real local rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is making a distinction between **where someone is truly rooted** and **where they currently reside**, suggesting that being a ""real"" local involves more than just living in the city. They implicitly reject the idea that mere residence in Chengdu makes someone a ""Chengdu person,"" instead emphasizing **family rootedness in a specific area** as the more authentic basis for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author clearly endorses **family rootedness in a specific suburban area** as the basis for local identity.
- They reject the idea that current residence alone (even in Chengdu) is sufficient to define someone as a ""local person.""
- There is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, language, or social networks as defining criteria.
- Although there is a critique of others’ assumptions, the author does not use occupational or functional livability criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text aligns most closely with **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, as the author implicitly defines ""local people"" based on **family history and generational rootedness in a specific area**, rather than just current residence or others’ assumptions.

Output: RL3"
不知道 但是知道土著一直在被其他人嘲讽口音 不知道有什么好笑的 特别是那个电炒饭...,RL4,"  
The author expresses frustration or criticism toward the mockery of ""local"" people's accents by others. They mention ""土著"" (indigenous/local people) being ridiculed, particularly in relation to a cultural reference (""电炒饭"" – possibly a local stereotype or inside joke). This indicates that the author sees linguistic-cultural traits (like accent) as a marker of local identity that is being unfairly targeted.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/local people): refers to those who are native or long-standing residents.  
- ""嘲讽口音"" (mocking accents): highlights linguistic identity as a boundary marker.  
- Implicitly, the author resists the idea that local accents should be a basis for ridicule, suggesting they believe such accents are integral to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author critiques the mockery of local accents, which implies that they believe accent is a legitimate part of local identity. Although the tone is critical, the underlying assumption is that linguistic features (accent, speech patterns) are being used to define who is considered a ""local"" — and that this definition carries social consequences.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author criticizes the *mockery*, they do not reject the *association* between accent and local identity. Instead, they imply that this association is real and being misused. Therefore, the author implicitly acknowledges that linguistic-cultural recognition (specifically accent) plays a role in defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, as the author discusses accent as a feature used to identify locals and as a basis for social evaluation or discrimination.

The author is defending ""Chengdu people"" against perceived discrimination or questioning from ""outsiders"" (外地人). They argue that it's actually the outsiders who are discriminatory, by asking intrusive questions about property ownership and lifestyle choices. The author also mentions being ""二环的"" (living within the Second Ring Road) and referring to going to Chunxi Road as ""进城"" (going into the city), which implies a habitual or symbolic understanding of Chengdu's spatial hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""二环的"" (living within the Second Ring Road):** Suggests a spatial identity marker.
- **""进城"" (going into the city):** Implies a socially conventional understanding of where the ""core"" of Chengdu is.
- **""外地人...问你，你们屋头有几套房？"" (outsiders ask: how many houses do your family own?):** Suggests outsiders are using property ownership as a standard to judge locals.
- **""半工半读那么努力？"" (working and studying hard):** May reflect economic status or lifestyle differences.
- **""外地的都很有钱...我们哪里敢有优越感"" (outsiders are rich; we locals aren't so we can't feel superior):** Implies economic status or property ownership as a perceived standard for claiming local superiority.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is pushing back against **others' criteria** (mainly property ownership and economic status) used to judge Chengdu locals. They **do not endorse** these standards. Instead, they argue that such standards are unfair and discriminatory.  
However, the author **does implicitly endorse** a spatial identity marker — being ""二环的"" and referring to Chunxi Road as ""the city"" — which reflects a **habitual, socially accepted spatial cognition** of where ""true"" Chengdu locals are from.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author implicitly endorses a habitual understanding of Chengdu's spatial hierarchy, using phrases like ""进城"" and identifying as ""二环的"" — indicating a socially accepted way of distinguishing core local areas.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** While property ownership and economic status are mentioned, they are **not endorsed by the author** as valid standards for local identity — instead, they are criticized as discriminatory. Therefore, **RL6 is not applicable.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The author uses a habitual, socially accepted spatial understanding of Chengdu's core area (Second Ring Road and ""进城"") to express their local identity. This aligns with **RL1**, which focuses on vernacular spatial cognition as a basis for local identity.

不知道什么时候开始我们老成都人就开始被人骂看不起人了，大多是普通家庭的老成都谁管你哪来的，为什么说成都包容度大就是不管别人的事啊，归属感不强不融入当地不是本地人的错,RL6,"  
The author is expressing frustration over the stereotype that ""老成都人"" (longtime Chengdu locals) are seen as looking down on others. They argue that most longtime locals come from ordinary families and do not care where newcomers are from. The author also defends the idea that Chengdu is inclusive because people ""don't interfere with each other,"" but they raise a deeper issue: if newcomers do not feel a sense of belonging or make efforts to integrate, it is not entirely the fault of the locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""老成都人"" (longtime Chengdu locals) implies a local identity based on historical rootedness or generational presence.
- ""归属感不强不融入当地"" (lack of belonging or integration) suggests that social embeddedness and cultural integration are part of the local identity dynamic.
- The author implies that the stereotype of locals being unwelcoming is unfair, suggesting that integration is a two-way process.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not explicitly defining who is ""local"" by traditional criteria (e.g., family history, dialect, or administrative status), but they are pushing back on the idea that locals are responsible for others' lack of belonging. They imply that local identity involves **mutual effort**, especially in terms of **social embeddedness** — that is, if people do not try to integrate or feel a sense of belonging, they may not be fully recognized as part of the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author implicitly endorses **social embeddedness** — integration and a sense of belonging — as a **necessary condition** (or at least a relevant factor) for being considered a full member of the local community, even if one lives there. This is not a rejection of inclusivity, but a call for mutual engagement.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which refers to integration into local social networks, a sense of belonging, and participation in the local community as a basis for being recognized as a ""local.""

锦江区二环攀成钢必须焊死在脑门上,RL1,"  
The phrase ""锦江区二环攀成钢必须焊死在脑门上"" (literally: ""the Erhuan, Pan Chenggang area in Jinjiang District must be welded to one's forehead"") is a vivid and exaggerated expression. It conveys that owning or being associated with property in this prestigious urban area is a mark of status—a kind of symbolic identity that one wants to visibly claim or is socially recognized for. The author is emphasizing that living in this specific, high-status area of Chengdu is a core part of local identity or prestige.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical specificity:** ""锦江区二环攀成钢"" (Jinjiang District, Erhuan, Pan Chenggang) refers to a well-known, high-end residential area in Chengdu.  
- **Symbolic attachment:** The metaphor ""焊死在脑门上"" (welded to one's forehead) implies that this location is not just a place to live, but a visible badge of honor or identity.  
- **Implicit hierarchy:** The statement suggests a hierarchy of urban areas where certain neighborhoods are seen as superior and confer identity value.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing property value or personal preference; they are expressing that living in this specific, socially recognized urban area is a marker of status and identity. The phrase implies that only those who live in such areas are truly recognized as ""local elites"" or ""genuine locals"" in a symbolic or social sense.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that certain urban areas (like Pan Chenggang in Jinjiang District) have symbolic value in defining ""local"" identity or prestige. This is not based on administrative boundaries (RL2), family history (RL3), language (RL4), or occupation (RL7), but on the **socially constructed symbolic meaning** and **habitual perception** of the area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where certain areas are imbued with symbolic meaning and used as shorthand for local identity or prestige in the public consciousness, regardless of official boundaries.

The author is defending ""real Chengdu people"" against external stereotypes and discrimination. They argue that negative comments about Chengdu—such as its food, urban environment, accent, and perceived authenticity—are coming from outsiders and that this kind of prejudice is unfair. The author implicitly defines what it means to be a ""real Chengdu person"" through long-term local belonging and the experience of being stereotyped by outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""弯脚杆"" (a derogatory term for rural migrants or outsiders) – relates to social boundaries and identity exclusion.
- ""攻击你家乡"" (attacking your hometown) – implies emotional attachment and local belonging.
- ""成都的面最难吃"" (Chengdu noodles are the worst), ""二环内市区破烂"" (the city within the 2nd Ring Road is run-down), ""口音难听"" (accent is unpleasant) – negative stereotypes used by outsiders.
- ""做人假打"" (phony people) – moral judgment on social behavior, possibly contrasting ""real"" locals with outsiders.
- ""每天被外地人歧视"" (discriminated by outsiders daily) – implies that being a ""real Chengdu person"" involves enduring prejudice, reinforcing a sense of local identity through shared experience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author constructs a sense of ""real Chengdu person"" identity in contrast to outsiders (""外地人"") who mock Chengdu's characteristics. The defense of Chengdu identity includes emotional attachment to place, resistance to negative cultural-linguistic judgments (e.g., accent), and the lived experience of discrimination. These elements collectively reinforce a local identity that is rooted in place, culture, and shared struggle.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **Cultural-linguistic identity**: The author resists the stereotype that Chengdu accents are unpleasant, implying that speaking the local dialect is a core part of being a Chengdu person.  
- **Social boundary against outsiders**: The author emphasizes that ""real Chengdu people"" are often discriminated against by outsiders, which reinforces a sense of local belonging through shared adversity.  
- **Implicit emotional map of the city**: The author defends the urban space (even the supposedly run-down parts like the 2nd Ring Road), suggesting that living within this area is part of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author implicitly defines ""local"" Chengdu identity through shared emotional attachment to the city space, even its degraded parts, and resists the outsider view that it's ""破烂"" (run-down).  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author pushes back against the idea that the Chengdu accent is unpleasant, indicating that linguistic identity is a core part of being a ""real Chengdu person.""  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author frames local identity as being shaped by long-term embedded experience — being ""daily"" discriminated against by outsiders — which implies a stable, rooted form of local identity.

我也三环外甚至都不会说自己是成都人，除非给外地人介绍时再加个成都成都土著一般指的中心城区吧,RL1,"  
The author conveys that they would not identify themselves as a ""Chengdu person"" if they live outside the Third Ring Road, implying that ""local Chengdu identity"" is associated with the **central urban area**. They also suggest that the term ""native Chengdu person"" is commonly understood to refer to people from the **central district**, not the broader metropolitan area. This reflects a **socially conventional spatial understanding** of where ""true locals"" come from.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) and ""中心城区"" (central urban area) are spatial references indicating location-based identity boundaries.  
- ""不会说自己是成都人"" (wouldn't say I'm a Chengdu person) implies that people self-identify or not based on spatial location.  
- ""成都土著一般指的中心城区"" (Chengdu natives usually refer to the central urban area) shows a **shared understanding or convention** about which areas are considered the ""core"" for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a boundary between **core and peripheral areas** within Chengdu, where only those in the **central area** are seen as ""real locals."" This is not based on administrative boundaries, family history, or language, but on **habitual, shared spatial perception**—a symbolic map of the city that defines who counts as local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **central urban areas are where ""real locals"" live**, and that people from outside the Third Ring Road are not perceived as such in everyday understanding. This reflects a **socially conventional spatial cognition** used to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses **shared, habitual understandings of intra-city spatial categories**—specifically, the centrality/periphery divide—to define who is considered a ""true local"" in Chengdu.

因为我们二环的一般没事不进城，就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a sense of spatial identity and habitual behavior tied to living in a ""remote"" or peripheral area near the Second Ring Road. They suggest that people like them, who live near the Second Ring Road, generally don't go into the city center unless necessary, and instead spend time in their own area. This implies a habitual spatial perception and emotional attachment to their local area, which is contrasted with the city center.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环"" (Second Ring Road) – a spatial reference point.
- ""没事不进城"" (don't go into the city center unless necessary) – a habitual behavior pattern.
- ""偏僻的地方"" (remote/outlying place) – a subjective spatial evaluation.
- Implicit sense of belonging and identification with the local area near the Second Ring Road.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not simply describing where they live or how convenient it is; rather, they are conveying a sense of local identity based on habitual spatial perception — a sense that their ""local"" world is centered around their own area, not the city center. This reflects a form of social and emotional mapping of space that distinguishes between ""us"" (near the Second Ring Road) and ""the city center"" (a different, less frequently visited space).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a local identity standard based on habitual spatial perception — that people from their area don't feel the need to go into the city center, and thus have a different lived experience and identity from those who do. This is not about administrative boundaries (RL2), family history (RL3), language (RL4), functional convenience (RL5), social or economic rootedness (RL6), or occupation (RL7), but rather about how space is socially and emotionally understood.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author is expressing a socially shared, habitual understanding of space that defines who belongs where, based on emotional or experiential maps rather than official boundaries.

The author emphasizes that Chengdu people are not inherently discriminatory or exclusionary toward outsiders. However, they point out that there is a **habitual, culturally transmitted label** — “弯脚杆” (bent-leg pole) — used by locals to refer to people from **outside the Third Ring Road**, which is linked to **regional perception and dialect differences**. The author frames this as a **socially accepted joke or cultural shorthand**, especially among the older generation, and clarifies that it's not meant to be discriminatory.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “三环外的弯脚杆” (people outside the Third Ring Road referred to as “bent-leg pole”): reflects a **socially habitual spatial label** used to distinguish locals from non-locals.
- “三环外就变口音了” (the accent changes outside the Third Ring Road): reflects **linguistic-cultural recognition**, specifically accent as a boundary marker.
- “老一辈传下来的” (passed down from the older generation): implies this is a **long-standing social convention**, not an administrative or legal rule.
- The author **does not endorse discrimination**, but acknowledges the **existence and social function** of this label.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key criteria the author implicitly acknowledges as shaping local identity are:
- **Vernacular spatial labels** (like “弯脚杆”) that reflect **habitual, socially accepted spatial boundaries**.
- **Accent change** as a **symbolic boundary marker** that aligns with those spatial perceptions.

The author does **not** use administrative boundaries (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), or economic status (RL6) as criteria for defining local identity. While the author **explicitly rejects** any discriminatory intent, they **do acknowledge** that these **symbolic spatial and linguistic labels** are part of the local identity framework.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- ✅ **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author acknowledges that “弯脚杆” is a socially habitual label for people from outside the Third Ring Road, indicating a **non-official, culturally sedimented spatial boundary**.
- ✅ **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author notes that **accent changes** at the Third Ring Road and is used as a **symbolic marker** for distinguishing locals from others.

Other RL categories are not endorsed or are explicitly rejected (e.g., discrimination, administrative legitimacy, family history).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's narrative reflects **two intertwined standards** for defining or recognizing ""local"" identity:
- **RL1:** Use of **habitual, culturally sedimented spatial labels** like “弯脚杆” to mark perceived boundaries of local identity.
- **RL4:** Use of **accent and dialect** as a **symbolic boundary marker** between locals and those from outside the core area.

哈哈哈哈 我土著我倒是还好，但我身边的土著亲戚朋友 确实看不起外地的 而且三环外的都不行 我亲戚还说我男朋友是农转非,"RL1, RL2","  
The author is describing the attitude of their ""土著"" (native/local) relatives and friends, who look down on people from outside the local area, and even consider those from beyond the Third Ring Road as not truly local. The term ""农转非"" (nong zhuan fei)—referring to someone who transitioned from rural to urban hukou—further reinforces a hierarchy based on origin and administrative status. The author is not necessarily endorsing this view but is reporting it as a prevalent attitude among locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (native/local) implies a sense of rootedness and local superiority.
- ""看不起外地的"" (look down on outsiders) reflects a boundary around who is considered local.
- ""三环外的都不行"" (those from beyond the Third Ring Road don’t count) indicates a spatial boundary based on habitual or social perception.
- ""农转非"" implies a distinction based on administrative classification and rural/urban identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is conveying a worldview held by their relatives and friends that defines ""local people"" using both **habitual spatial boundaries** (RL1) and **administrative legitimacy** (RL2). The use of ""土著"" and the exclusion of those beyond the Third Ring Road aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a socially accepted boundary of ""true locals."" The use of ""农转非"" reflects **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it emphasizes the perceived legitimacy of one's local status based on hukou transformation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly endorse the view, they are **reporting a prevailing local logic** that they are familiar with and that shapes local identity in their social context. Since this logic is presented as a **taken-for-granted standard** within the local community, and not something the author rejects, it qualifies as part of the author’s **implicit understanding of local identity criteria**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1** applies because the author conveys a local perception that only people within certain spatial boundaries (inside the Third Ring Road) are considered true locals.
- **RL2** applies because the term ""农转非"" reflects a belief that administrative background (hukou history) affects whether someone is seen as a legitimate local.

Output: RL1, RL2"
大邑不算，土著是一二三环内,RL1,"  
The author is clearly defining what areas **do not count** as truly ""local"" (大邑不算) and specifying that **""local people"" (土著) are those from within the First, Second, and Third Ring Roads**. This reflects a **spatial认知标准**—a habitual or socially accepted understanding of which areas are considered the core ""local"" zones.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""大邑不算"" (Deyi doesn't count) — excludes certain areas from being considered part of the ""local"" identity.  
- ""土著是一二三环内"" (Native locals are from within the First, Second, and Third Ring Roads) — defines the core local identity as being spatially bounded by these ring roads.  
- The logic is based on **habitual spatial perception**, not administrative boundaries or personal history.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a **symbolic spatial boundary** to distinguish who counts as ""local"" based on **shared, habitual urban spatial cognition**, not on administrative divisions or personal/family history. This reflects a **socially constructed emotional or symbolic map** of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that only people from within the inner city ring roads are true locals, and explicitly excludes other areas (like Deyi). This is a **spatial认知标准** rooted in **urban spatial habit**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This logic aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, which refers to **shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**, used to define who is or isn't a ""true local.""

以前主要是大邑口音真的重，现在还好了吧现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著,RL4,"  
The author reflects on how the strong local accent (""大邑口音"") was once a notable feature of local identity, and suggests that now, despite some change, there is a new phenomenon of discrimination from outsiders (non-locals in Chengdu) toward ""Chengdu natives"" (""成都土著""). This implies that linguistic-cultural features (such as accent) are tied to local identity, and that outsiders may use these features to distinguish or marginalize locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""大邑口音真的重"" (really strong Dali accent): linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著"" (nowadays outsiders in Chengdu especially discriminate against Chengdu natives): implies an identity boundary between locals and outsiders, possibly based on cultural or linguistic traits.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author points out that accent is a feature associated with local identity, and that this feature is now being used (or perceived as being used) by outsiders to exclude or mock ""local people."" While the author does not explicitly endorse the use of accent as a standard for defining locals, they implicitly treat it as a **real and recognized marker** of local identity that is being targeted by outsiders. This means the author **accepts** the idea that accent is a defining characteristic of local identity, even if they are critical of the discrimination that results.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author does **not** endorse the discrimination, but they do **acknowledge and imply** that accent is a recognized feature of local identity.
- The text reflects that linguistic-cultural traits (specifically accent) are **seen as valid markers of local identity**, even if used negatively by outsiders.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, because the author treats the local accent as a **recognized and meaningful marker** of local identity, even in the context of discrimination. The author implicitly accepts that accent plays a role in defining who is considered a ""local"" in social perception.

The author describes a generational shift in family settlement and identity: the grandparents’ generation originally came from Deyi County but have now all moved to Chengdu, and there seems to be little communication or emotional connection to the ancestral place. By the time of the father’s generation, the family already identifies as ""native Chengdu people"" — implying a transition in local identity based on family migration history and generational change.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""My grandfather's hometown is in Deyi County"" — indicates ancestral origin.  
- ""The entire family has moved to Chengdu"" — shows migration and settlement change.  
- ""There’s been little communication"" and ""no intention to visit the ancestral place"" — suggests weakening ties to the ancestral location.  
- ""My father’s generation already considers themselves native Chengdu people"" — indicates a shift in identity based on generational settlement.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author shows how a family with relatively recent migration roots in Chengdu has come to identify as ""native"" within one or two generations, implying that long-term family settlement and generational continuity — rather than strict ancestral origin — are what define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""local"" is defined by generational settlement and family rootedness in the city, rather than hukou or administrative origin. This is shown through the statement that the father’s generation now identifies as ""native Chengdu people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This reflects the logic of **RL3: Family Rootedness**, where local identity is determined by generational depth of family settlement and upbringing history, rather than administrative or linguistic criteria.

Output: RL3"
思想观念，口音，穿着品味,RL4,"  
The author lists three aspects—**思想观念** (ideological outlook), **口音** (accent), and **穿着品味** (dress sense)—which together form a set of criteria used to distinguish or evaluate ""local"" identity. These are cultural and linguistic markers that imply a standard for identifying who belongs to the local community and who does not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **口音** (accent) clearly relates to linguistic features.  
- **思想观念** (ideological outlook) and **穿着品味** (fashion sense) are cultural traits that reflect broader social norms and values.  
Together, these elements suggest a cultural framework used to distinguish insiders from outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that these cultural and linguistic traits are **used as boundary markers** for defining ""local people.""  
- Accent (口音) is a direct indicator of **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.  
- Ideological outlook and dress sense, while not explicitly linguistic, are **cultural habits** that help define who is considered ""local"" versus ""outsider."" These function as **extensions of cultural identity**, reinforcing the boundary logic of RL4.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not resist or negate these criteria; rather, they are presented as **valid standards** for evaluating local identity. These are **endorsed or at least accepted as relevant** for defining who counts as ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The core RL category that best matches this logic is **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as it includes both **accent** and **cultural habits** (which can encompass ideological outlook and dress sense) as criteria for defining local identity.

Output: RL4"
……如果北京上海土著来到成都也是外地人，是不是也歧视人家思想意识 口音 和穿着品味,none,"  
The author is raising a critical question about the logic of local identity boundaries — specifically, whether even ""natives"" of major cities like Beijing or Shanghai would be considered ""non-local"" (外地人) in Chengdu, and thus subject to the same forms of discrimination based on cultural and behavioral traits. The author implies that such exclusionary logic is arbitrary and potentially hypocritical.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""北京上海土著"" (natives of Beijing/Shanghai) → suggests family rootedness or generational heritage in another city.
- ""来到成都也是外地人"" (still considered outsiders in Chengdu) → implies that local identity is place-specific and not transferable.
- ""歧视人家思想意识 口音 和穿着品味"" (discriminate based on mindset, accent, and fashion taste) → explicitly names linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) and cultural taste as exclusionary criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing these criteria but is instead **critiquing** the logic of using them to exclude people from local identity. They are **resisting** the idea that someone's accent, mindset, or fashion sense should determine whether they are considered ""local"" or not. The mention of Beijing/Shanghai natives being treated as outsiders in Chengdu is used to **highlight the absurdity** of such exclusionary standards.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- Although the text mentions **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** explicitly, the author is **not endorsing** these criteria — they are **criticizing** their use.
- The mention of ""北京上海土著"" (natives of other cities) might suggest **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**, but again, this is not the author's own standard for defining ""local"" — it's a hypothetical scenario used to question the logic of local identity.
- Therefore, **none of the RL categories apply**, because the author is not endorsing any of the standards discussed — they are questioning them.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is **critiquing** rather than endorsing the use of linguistic, cultural, or rootedness-based criteria to define local identity, **no RL category applies**.

The author is mocking and rejecting the idea that urban identity or superiority is justified by attributes like ""思想观念口音穿着品味"" (thoughts, accent, dress, taste). They argue that in the 21st century, it's outdated to believe only city people are progressive or refined, and they especially dismiss the relevance of accent. The tone is critical and sarcastic toward those who use such criteria to distinguish ""urban"" (and by implication, ""local"") identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- Mentions of ""思想观念"" (thoughts/ideology), ""口音"" (accent), ""穿着品味"" (dress and taste) are all potential identity markers.
- The author explicitly **rejects** using these as standards for defining ""local"" or ""urban"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is **critiquing** the use of cultural-linguistic traits (like accent) and lifestyle indicators (like fashion sense or taste) as criteria for determining who is a ""true"" or superior local. These are not standards the author endorses; rather, they are standards the author is **explicitly dismissing**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
None of the criteria mentioned (accent, dress, taste, thought patterns) are **endorsed** by the author as valid standards for defining local identity. The author is **rejecting** their use.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Since the author **explicitly opposes** using cultural-linguistic or lifestyle-based markers (like accent or taste) to define local identity, and does not endorse any other criteria, **no RL category applies**.

认识的成都本地朋友中，没有这种人。网上一刷，这成都的鄙视链比北京都严重。比京二环的好像要牛气多了,RL1,"  
The author is commenting on the phenomenon of a ""local hierarchy"" or ""local identity-based discrimination"" (referred to as a ""chain of contempt"") in Chengdu, suggesting that it is even more pronounced than in Beijing. They contrast their personal experience (not knowing anyone in this hierarchy among their local Chengdu friends) with what they observe online, implying that there is a socially constructed hierarchy of local identity that some people take pride in or use to assert superiority.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""没有这种人"" (don't know anyone like that) indicates the author's personal social circle does not reflect this hierarchy.
- ""鄙视链"" (chain of contempt) implies a ranking or stratification of local identity.
- ""比北京都严重"" (more severe than Beijing), ""比京二环的好像要牛气多了"" (seems more arrogant than Beijing's Second Ring Road people) compares Chengdu's local identity hierarchy to a known symbolic hierarchy in Beijing, suggesting that symbolic or spatial markers are being used to assert superiority.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not personally endorsing the hierarchy but is noting its existence and strength in online discourse. However, the **fact that such a hierarchy exists and is symbolically meaningful** (even if criticized) implies that **symbolic spatial categories** are being used by others to define or rank ""local"" identity. Importantly, the author does not reject the idea that certain spatial identities (e.g., ""people from certain parts of Chengdu"") are seen as more authentic or superior — they simply note its existence and intensity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author seems critical of the phenomenon, they **do not explicitly reject** the idea that certain areas are symbolically more ""local"" — instead, they observe that this symbolic hierarchy exists and is strong. Therefore, the author implicitly accepts that **symbolic spatial categories** are used to define or rank ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the text discusses how certain areas (by implication, more central or historically significant parts of Chengdu) are symbolically ranked higher in local identity, and how this ranking is perceived as even more pronounced than in Beijing.

The author identifies as a ""native within Chengdu's Second Ring Road"" (二环内土著), but explicitly denies having a sense of superiority or strong social connections tied to local identity. They mention having few social circles and that most of their friends are not local, without expressing any strong distinction or boundary between ""locals"" and ""non-locals."" The tone is neutral and non-assertive regarding any criteria for defining ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环内土著"" (native within the Second Ring Road): This is a self-identification based on geography and rootedness.
- ""没优越感"" (no sense of superiority): Indicates the author does not endorse a hierarchy based on local identity.
- ""也没什么社交圈子"" (not much social circle), ""大多不是本地人"" (mostly not locals): Indicates weak social embeddedness or exclusive social boundaries.
- ""也没觉得啥"" (doesn’t feel anything): Further reinforces the lack of strong identification or evaluation standards tied to being a ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author uses the label ""native within the Second Ring Road,"" they do not use this identity to define or evaluate ""local people"" in any exclusive or hierarchical way. There is no endorsement of any boundary, standard, or logic that would qualify as a definition of ""local identity"" in the context of RL categories. Instead, the author downplays the significance of local identity in their personal experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse or imply any specific standard (e.g., spatial cognition, administrative belonging, family rootedness, linguistic recognition, etc.) as a way to define or evaluate ""local people."" The self-identification as a ""native"" is stated factually, not evaluatively or normatively.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author reflects on how the concept of ""Chengdu native"" (成都土著) did not exist in their childhood but has emerged and become recognized in the past decade. They express a sense of distance or confusion toward this newly constructed identity, questioning who introduced or defined it. This implies a critique or awareness of how local identity has been socially constructed over time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候没有成都土著这个概念"" (There was no concept of 'Chengdu native' in my childhood): suggests that the identity is not historically rooted or naturally existing, but rather a recent social construct.
- ""这十年也不知道是谁定义了这个概念"" (I don’t know who defined this concept in the past decade): indicates the author perceives this identity label as being imposed or developed externally, not as a natural or self-evident category.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing any specific standard for defining ""local people."" Instead, they are questioning the emergence and source of the concept itself. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of criteria such as administrative belonging, family rootedness, linguistic recognition, etc. Rather, the author is pointing to the **social construction** of local identity and possibly critiquing its legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse any specific RL category as a standard for defining ""local identity."" They are not affirming the validity of the ""Chengdu native"" concept, nor are they using it themselves to judge who is local. Instead, they are expressing awareness of its recent emergence and questioning its source.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does **not** endorse any specific standard for defining ""local identity,"" and is instead **questioning the very existence or legitimacy** of such a concept, **none of the RL categories apply**.

没有什么优越感。土著，从长顺街出来的，从上班就开始羡慕当年周边的城乡结合部，有分红，有拆迁，有土地。到现在40+，就羡慕从农村来的，过年可以回乡下放火炮，杀猪，天然无污染环境。读以前的锦小时，很多同学都是军区后勤的家属，也羡慕啊，什么都有优待。反正，没有觉得土著有太多优越感，不过还是很怀念以前长顺上街，中街以及长发街附近的老邻居些。,RL3,"  
The author explicitly states that they do not feel a sense of superiority as a ""native"" (土著), and instead expresses **nostalgia** and **emotional attachment** to their childhood neighborhood (长顺上街, 中街, 长发街). They also mention that growing up in the area meant lacking the benefits (e.g., dividends, demolition compensation, land rights) that people from rural or peri-urban areas enjoyed. The author further reflects on how different groups (e.g., military dependents) had privileges, implying that being a native does not equate to privilege.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):**  
  - ""土著"" (native), ""从长顺街出来的"" (came from Changshun Street), ""读以前的锦小时"" (studied at the former Jinshi School), ""怀念以前长顺上街，中街以及长发街附近的老邻居些"" (miss the old neighbors on Changshun Upper Street, Middle Street, and Changfa Street) — all indicate long-term familial and personal rootedness in the area.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):**  
  - Mentions of lacking dividends, demolition benefits, and land rights imply that some groups (e.g., rural residents) have deeper **social and economic integration** or **entitlement** in the local system, suggesting a contrast with the author’s own status.  
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):**  
  - ""军区后勤的家属"" (families of military logistics personnel) are described as having privileges, indicating that **occupation-based identity** is used to distinguish social groups and access to resources.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author reflects on their own local identity as a native born and raised in the area (RL3), but contrasts it with others who have **socially or economically embedded advantages** (RL6), such as rural residents with land rights or military dependents with benefits (RL7). This suggests that while the author identifies strongly with the area through family rootedness, they **do not equate being a native with privilege**, and in fact, feel a sense of **disadvantage** compared to others.  
The mention of these other groups is not to define ""local identity"" in opposition to themselves, but rather to **highlight that other forms of social or economic rootedness** (not just generational residence) can carry more tangible benefits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** their own long-term rootedness and emotional connection to the area as part of their identity — this aligns with **RL3**.
- The author **does not endorse** the idea that rural residents or military dependents are more ""local"" — rather, they contrast their own native identity with these groups in terms of **social or economic privilege**, not local belonging.
- Therefore, **only RL3** reflects a standard the author **uses to define their own local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects a **self-identification as a native** rooted in long-term family history and emotional connection to the neighborhood. The author does not define ""local"" in terms of administrative status, language, or economic privilege, but rather through **generational presence and personal growth history** in the area.

Output: RL3"
我家反正是三环外城乡结合部，周边啥都有反正不进城里玩一般,RL5,"  
The author describes their residential location as being in a peri-urban area outside the Third Ring Road. They imply that this area is functionally self-sufficient (""周边啥都有"" — ""everything is around here"") and that there's no need to go into the city center (""不进城里玩一般"" — ""usually don't go downtown to play""). This suggests a perception of the area as livable and functionally adequate, even if not in the urban core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三环外城乡结合部"" (peri-urban area outside the Third Ring Road) — geographical location.
- ""周边啥都有"" (everything is around here) — implies functional livability and access to amenities.
- ""不进城里玩一般"" (usually don't go downtown to play) — suggests the area is self-contained and convenient for daily life.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author appears to be normalizing their residential choice or situation by emphasizing the functional convenience and completeness of their local area. This implies that the area, though not in the traditional urban core, still meets the standard of a desirable or sufficient ""local"" living space based on its livability features.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that a place can be considered a valid or sufficient ""local"" area based on its functional livability — having all necessary amenities and being convenient for daily life — even if it is located in a peri-urban or suburban zone.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author evaluates the area based on its livability features and implicitly accepts it as a valid or sufficient ""local"" space based on those characteristics.

Output: RL5"
有歧视的老土著挺多的，尤其是住在那种老破小的中年和老年人当然肯定也有很友好的土著，但是那种谈到三环外的5句话就有弯脚杆的土著占比还是很多,RL1,"  
The author is describing a social phenomenon: many long-time local residents (老土著) show discriminatory attitudes, especially those living in old, small, and rundown housing (老破小). These locals often express disdain toward people from outside the Third Ring Road, using the term ""弯脚杆"" — a derogatory term — within just a few sentences. This reflects a boundary drawn by locals based on **habitual spatial cognition**, i.e., who belongs to the ""true local"" space and who does not.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""老土著"" (long-time locals): indicates family rootedness or generational settlement.
- ""老破小"": describes housing type, possibly associated with social embeddedness or class distinctions.
- ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road): a spatial boundary marker.
- ""弯脚杆"": a derogatory term for outsiders, used based on where someone is from — a symbolic spatial boundary.
- Discriminatory behavior by locals based on place of origin: reflects **symbolic spatial cognition** used to distinguish ""true locals"" from others.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The key logic is that **some locals use habitual spatial cognition** — particularly the boundary of the Third Ring Road — to distinguish ""us"" (true locals) from ""them"" (outsiders or peripheral residents). This is not about administrative boundaries, language, or economic status, but about **shared, socially sedimented perceptions of which areas ""count"" as the real local space**, and who is excluded.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
Although the author is critical of this discriminatory attitude, they **describe it as a widespread social perception** — a shared logic used by locals to define who counts as ""local."" This is a **description of the prevailing symbolic spatial logic**, not necessarily the author's endorsement, but it **is presented as a real and influential standard in local identity discourse**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author is referencing a **shared, habitual spatial boundary** (Third Ring Road) that is socially accepted and symbolically significant in defining who is considered a ""true local"" and who is not.

好像！！？你说的有道理！！！不过成都土著没有拆迁户过的轻松就不明白这优越感哪里来的hhh,(none),"  
The author is engaging in a casual, conversational tone, reacting to a prior statement and questioning the source of ""superiority"" or优越感 (a sense of superiority) that some native Chengdu residents may feel. The author implies that if native Chengdu residents are not living as comfortably as拆迁户 (residents who have been relocated due to urban development and often receive compensation or new housing), then it's unclear why they would feel superior. This reflects a critique of assumed local identity privilege.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都土著"" (native Chengdu residents) implies a local identity based on long-term or generational rootedness.  
- ""拆迁户"" (relocated residents) refers to a group that, due to government compensation or housing benefits, may enjoy better living conditions than long-time locals.  
- The author questions the legitimacy of优越感, suggesting that economic or housing benefits might be a standard by which some locals feel superior.  
- The tone is ironic and questioning, not affirming or endorsing the优越感, but rather critiquing it.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing any specific standard for defining ""local identity"" but is instead questioning or mocking the assumption that native locals are inherently superior, especially when their living conditions or economic status may not be better than those of relocated residents. The reference to拆迁户 serves to contrast two types of local identities: one based on historical rootedness and one based on material benefits from urban development.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse any specific RL-based criteria for defining local identity. They are **critiquing** the idea that native locals have inherent superiority, suggesting that material or economic conditions (e.g., being a拆迁户) may actually confer more advantage.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does **not** endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity"" and is instead questioning or resisting such criteria, **no RL category applies**.

成都人不是被骂的人吗？陈冠希。假打。口音难听。全是槽点。,RL4,"  
The author expresses a negative attitude toward ""Chengdu people,"" using phrases like ""陈冠希"" (Edison Chen, a controversial figure), ""假打"" (fake, pretentious), and ""口音难听"" (difficult-to-listen-to accent) as points of mockery or criticism. The phrase ""成都人不是被骂的人吗？"" (""Aren't Chengdu people just people who get criticized?"") implies that Chengdu people are often the target of ridicule, and the author seems to endorse or at least not reject this view.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音难听"" (difficult-to-listen-to accent) clearly points to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- The overall tone suggests that the author uses accent and cultural stereotypes to define or mock Chengdu people as outsiders or inferior locals.  
- The mention of ""被骂"" (being criticized/mocked) implies a symbolic boundary between ""us"" and ""them"" based on cultural-linguistic traits.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses accent and cultural mockery to draw a boundary between themselves and ""Chengdu people,"" implying that these are reasons why Chengdu people are not considered legitimate or desirable locals. This reflects an exclusionary standard based on cultural-linguistic traits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly uses accent and cultural traits as a standard for criticizing or excluding Chengdu people from a preferred ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses accent and cultural mockery as criteria to judge or exclude certain groups from being considered legitimate locals.

Output: RL4"
都是外地人歧视成都口音的嘛,RL4,"  
The author is expressing frustration or questioning the phenomenon where people are discriminating against the **Chengdu accent**, implying that this discrimination comes from **non-locals (""外地人"")**. The author is likely defending the Chengdu accent and criticizing outsiders for looking down on it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a clear linguistic-cultural marker.
- The author is drawing a distinction between ""locals"" (who speak with a Chengdu accent) and ""outsiders"" (who do not and who discriminate).
- The core idea is that **accent is being used as a boundary marker** between locals and non-locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that the Chengdu accent is a key feature associated with local identity, and that this feature is being used by outsiders to discriminate. Although the author is critical of the discrimination, they are **affirming** that the accent is a meaningful cultural-linguistic marker of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author opposes the **discrimination**, they are **not rejecting the cultural-linguistic identity marker itself**. Instead, they are affirming that **the accent is associated with local identity**, even if it is being unfairly judged.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, accent) as a marker of local identity, which aligns with **RL4**.

Output: RL4"
我觉得成都口音挺好听的呀。,N/A,"  
The author expresses a positive sentiment toward the Chengdu accent, indicating an emotional or cultural attachment to it. However, the statement does **not** include any explicit or implicit logic about using accent to define who is or isn't a ""local"" person — it is more of a **personal aesthetic preference**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is related to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).
- However, the author does **not** suggest that speaking this accent is a **criterion for defining local identity**, nor do they use it to distinguish locals from outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no functional role** played by linguistic-cultural recognition in defining ""local identity"" in this statement. The author is simply expressing a **subjective opinion** about the sound of the accent.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does **not** use accent as a **standard for defining local identity**, and there is **no boundary-drawing or identity judgment** based on linguistic features, **no RL criteria apply**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the statement involves accent (linguistic-cultural recognition), it **does not fulfill** the requirement of being used to **define or evaluate local identity**. Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

The author is describing the demographic makeup of their social environment—highlighting the prevalence of ""外地人"" (non-locals) in their schooling and work experiences. They downplay the significance of local identity in daily life, emphasizing that most people are ""打工人"" (workers), and that local identity doesn't confer much advantage. However, they do acknowledge that some ""拆迁户老嬢嬢"" (older local women from demolished areas) display a sense of superiority, which can cause friction. The author also notes that while most of their peers married locally, some did not, indicating that marriage patterns are not a strict boundary marker.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""从小学到上班，身边就很多外地同学同事"" (since primary school to work, many non-local classmates and colleagues) – indicates that local/non-local is not a major dividing line in social life.
- ""外地朋友些太多了哈，正常普通人没得啥子优越感的"" – suggests that most people do not feel local identity grants superiority.
- ""有些拆迁户老嬢嬢是会有些优越感"" – implies that some locals (especially older, possibly long-standing residents) do assert superiority based on local identity.
- ""结婚的问题...本地结婚的多...也有嫁到外地和取外地姑娘的同学"" – marriage patterns are mentioned but not framed as a strict criterion for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author's main point is that in their experience, local identity is not a major axis of social division or privilege—most people are non-locals, and everyone is ""打工人."" However, the author does note that **some locals (older women, possibly with property or historical ties)** express a sense of superiority, which could be interpreted as a form of **social rootedness-based identity** (RL6), though it is not something the author personally endorses. The author critiques this attitude, suggesting it's annoying and that non-locals can just choose to ignore it.

There is **no strong endorsement of administrative, linguistic, cultural, spatial, or occupational criteria** for defining ""local people"" in this text.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **does not endorse** any specific standard for defining ""local identity"" as legitimate.
- They **critique** the idea that some locals have superiority, implying that they **do not agree** with using local identity as a basis for social hierarchy.
- However, they **acknowledge** that some locals (拆迁户老嬢嬢) **do** act as if they have superior status, which may reflect **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**—a sense of superiority rooted in historical presence, property, or community influence.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Although the author is critical of the idea, they **acknowledge the existence** of a local identity grounded in **historical presence and embeddedness**, as exemplified by the behavior of some older locals. This reflects **RL6**, as it involves **socially rooted identity claims**, even if the author does not personally endorse them.

The author reflects on how their ""local identity"" as a Chengdu native once carried a sense of privilege — they didn’t have to pay rent, lived comfortably, and were envied by migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan. However, over time, this sense of superiority diminished, especially as migrant families also settled permanently in Chengdu, blurring the distinction between ""local"" and ""non-local."" The author now feels there is no real difference or advantage in being a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""Didn’t have to pay rent, just came home to eat and sleep""** – implies rootedness and access to local resources (RL6).
- **""Migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan... heard you were a local, they were envious""** – indicates a perceived hierarchy based on local identity (RL3 or RL6).
- **""Parents went back to hometown for holidays"" vs. 'we only have Chengdu as our hometown'** – highlights the contrast between rooted family history and more recent settlement (RL3).
- **""They also bought houses and settled down in Chengdu""** – points to changing social embeddedness and economic integration of migrants (RL6).
- **""No sense of superiority anymore""** – shows a shift in the author’s perception of what it means to be local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s sense of local identity was initially tied to **family rootedness** (not needing to rent, having a home base) and **social embeddedness** (being envied by migrants). However, as migrants also became embedded in the city (buying homes, settling), the author's perception of what defines a ""local"" shifted. This reflects a **weakening of family-rootedness as a defining criterion** and a **realization that social and economic integration can redefine ""local"" identity.**

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **family history** and **social-economic integration** are key in shaping or redefining local identity. The author acknowledges that being a ""local"" used to mean something distinct due to family history, but now, with migrants also settling in Chengdu, the boundary has blurred.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author reflects on how being born and raised in Chengdu, with family ties, used to be a marker of local identity.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author notes that migrants have also become embedded in Chengdu through housing and settlement, challenging the traditional boundary of ""localness.""

没有，倒是会被外地人歧视，说我说话口音牙尖弯酸，天天都说“电炒饭”,RL4,"  
The author expresses that they are discriminated against by outsiders due to their local accent, describing it as ""sharp and sour,"" and mentions being mocked for frequently saying ""dian chaofan"" (a local pronunciation or phrase). This reflects the author's perception of linguistic-cultural features (such as accent and specific expressions) as markers of local identity that lead to exclusion by outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Accent"" (口音) is directly mentioned as a feature others use to judge or mock the author.
- ""Discrimination by outsiders"" based on speech patterns indicates that linguistic features are used as a boundary marker.
- ""Electric fried rice"" (电炒饭) is a culturally specific expression that symbolizes local speech habits.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly conveys that linguistic features (accent and local expressions) are used by others to identify and exclude them as a ""local person."" Although the author does not explicitly endorse this standard, they present it as a lived experience — that is, they accept and recognize that their accent is a marker of local identity that others use to distinguish locals from outsiders.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is on the receiving end of discrimination, they do not explicitly reject the idea that accent and speech habits are used to define local identity. Instead, they accept it as a social reality — which, under the annotation guidelines, counts as an implicit endorsement of the logic.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4, which is based on **linguistic-cultural recognition** — specifically, using accent and local speech habits as a boundary marker for local identity, even when that usage leads to exclusion or mockery.

都江堰的在成都上班，被别个说我的口音好难听我想说关你毛线事，我爱咋咋说。有些人都不想多说,N/A,"  
The author is expressing frustration and resistance toward others mocking their accent, despite working in Chengdu. They strongly assert their own linguistic freedom (""I love how I speak"") and show a sense of defiance against linguistic-based judgment. This implies that the author is aware of accent as a marker that others use to judge ""localness,"" but they reject that standard.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""My accent is so unpleasant to listen to"" (别人说我口音好难听) — linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) is clearly referenced.
- The author's rebuttal — ""What's it to you? I'll speak however I want"" (关你毛线事，我爱咋咋说) — indicates they reject accent as a valid criterion for judging identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While linguistic-cultural recognition (specifically accent) is mentioned, the author explicitly **rejects** it as a valid standard for judging identity or belonging. The text is not endorsing RL4; rather, it is resisting the use of accent as a boundary marker for ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author is clearly resisting the use of accent as a standard for defining ""local"" identity, **RL4 is not endorsed** by the author and should not be annotated.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
There is **no RL category** that the author explicitly or implicitly endorses in this text. The discussion centers on **resisting** a criterion (accent), not endorsing it. Therefore, **no RL label should be assigned**.

The author is articulating a deep sense of local identity rooted in **long-term familial presence**, **cultural and linguistic unity**, **emotional connection to place**, and **stable social networks**. They contrast this with what they see as superficial material concerns (e.g., number of properties, property value) that they associate with ""outsiders"" or ""newcomers."" The author clearly endorses **family rootedness**, **linguistic-cultural recognition**, and **social embeddedness** as the core bases of ""true local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- **Social embeddedness:** ""同学朋友三十年后还是在一起吃吃喝喝"" (classmates and friends from childhood still hang out together after 30 years) — indicates long-standing local social networks.
- **Rejection of materialist criteria:** ""买了几个房子值多少钱"" (how many houses one bought and their value), ""外地人才锱铢必较"" (only outsiders care about this), ""成都人都有房子"" (Chengdu people all have houses) — indicates the author **does not endorse** property or economic status as markers of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
Each of these elements (family rootedness, linguistic-cultural unity, and embedded social networks) are **positively framed** and **explicitly positioned** by the author as the **foundation of local identity and superiority**. The author is **not merely describing** these traits, but **using them to define what it means to be a ""true local""** — as opposed to newcomers or outsiders who lack these qualities.

- ✅ **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author emphasizes shared dialect, cultural identity, and lifestyle habits as key differentiators of locals.
- ✅ **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author highlights enduring social networks (e.g., lifelong friendships, family gatherings) as a marker of genuine local belonging.
- ❌ **RL5 (Functional Livability):** While comfort of housing is mentioned, it is **explicitly rejected** as a standard for judging local identity.

They also mention that their local identity can be verified through their accent (""能看口音可查""), indicating that both family history and linguistic-cultural recognition are standards they endorse for defining ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""同成华区土著三代成都人"" (third-generation native Chengdu person from Chenghua District) reflects family historical rootedness.  
- ""能看口音可查"" (can check the accent) implies linguistic-cultural recognition as a verifiable marker of local identity.

有，比上海更甚，直接对你说你说的话（口音）他们听不懂，是哪个县份上的,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that in the location being discussed, there is a strong linguistic boundary — to the extent that even spoken communication (especially accent) can be unintelligible to others, and people may directly ask, “Which county are you from?” This implies that accent and dialect are used as clear markers of local identity and belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “你说的话（口音）他们听不懂” (they can’t understand your way of speaking / accent) highlights linguistic differences.
- “是哪个县份上的” (which county are you from) shows that speech differences are so distinct that they are used to pinpoint geographic origin, serving as a proxy for local/non-local identification.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **accent and dialect** serve as boundary markers for local identity. The inability to understand each other's speech and the need to identify someone's county origin through their accent both reinforce the idea that **language is being used as a standard to distinguish locals from outsiders**.

The author does not resist or criticize this linguistic boundary — rather, they present it as a factual and defining characteristic of the local identity structure in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses **accent and dialect unintelligibility** as a marker of local identity differentiation.

可能外地人不希望自己孩子一口四川话吧 毕竟这口音真的好难听 还联姻都用上了,RL4,"  
The author implies that there is a negative perception of the Sichuan accent (""四川话"")—they describe it as ""really unpleasant to listen to"" (""真的好难听"")—and even mention that accent influences marriage choices (""联姻都用上了""). This suggests that linguistic features (specifically, accent) are being used as a boundary marker between ""locals"" and ""non-locals,"" with the author implicitly endorsing accent as a factor in defining or evaluating local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""四川话"" (Sichuan dialect) and ""口音"" (accent) clearly point to linguistic features.
- ""外地人不希望自己孩子一口四川话"" (non-locals don’t want their children to speak Sichuan dialect with a strong accent) implies that accent is seen as a marker of local identity that outsiders may resist.
- ""联姻都用上了"" (even affecting marriage) shows how deeply linguistic identity is embedded in social boundaries.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the idea of accent and its social consequences (e.g., affecting marriage) to highlight how linguistic features are not just about communication but are also used to distinguish insiders from outsiders. This supports the use of linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that linguistic features (specifically, accent) are used to define or evaluate local identity, and even criticizes or points out the social consequences of having a certain accent.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the use of linguistic-cultural features—specifically accent—as a boundary marker for local identity, aligning with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.

The author is reflecting on what they consider to be the qualities that define a ""true local"" or someone worthy of respect in Chengdu. They reject superficial markers like birthplace or family background, instead emphasizing personal qualities such as hard work, education, professional success, and modesty. They also mention their own property and economic stability, as well as the presence of many high-achieving outsiders in their professional circle.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Education and professional background:** Mentions of university education, internet industry work, and high salaries.
- **Occupation and professional environment:** Working in the tech/Internet industry, surrounded by high-achieving professionals (many of whom are outsiders).
- **Property and economic status:** Being a ""demolition household"" (拆迁户) and owning two houses in the southern part of the city.
- **Self-identity and values:** Emphasis on hard work, wisdom, kindness, and effort as sources of personal pride and ""superiority.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a definition of ""local identity"" that is not based on birthplace, hukou, or family history, but rather on **personal qualities and achievements** that they associate with being a respected and integrated member of Chengdu society. They also **implicitly endorse** the idea that economic success and professional competence (especially in desirable sectors like tech) are key indicators of value, regardless of origin.

While they mention property ownership and economic status, these are not framed as **exclusive** markers of local identity, but rather as **components of personal success**. The author also **rejects traditional markers** like family background or bragging about property, focusing instead on **personal effort and professional competence**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author emphasizes their own integration into a professional network dominated by high-achieving individuals (many of whom are outsiders), suggesting that **social and economic integration into local professional life** is a key standard for local belonging.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The author highlights their work in the tech/Internet industry and the high status of this profession, suggesting that **occupational prestige** is a standard used to evaluate local identity and social worth.

Other elements (like property ownership or educational background) are mentioned but are not framed as **exclusive** or **primary** criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the author’s use of **professional integration and occupational prestige** as key standards for evaluating local identity and personal value. While property and education are mentioned, they are not the central logic the author uses to define who is respected or accepted as part of the local community.

The text is a **satirical imitation** of a specific kind of local identity discourse — one that asserts superiority based on being a ""native"" or ""true local"" and simultaneously looks down on others based on occupation, residence area, or cultural behavior. The final sentence is the **author’s own critique**, mocking those who adopt such exclusionary local identity stances, especially when they end up being deferential to outsiders from cities perceived as more prestigious.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""不上班的""**, **""南门那边都是外地来打工的""** → links occupation with local identity (RL7).
- **""天府新区那边一堆农民拆迁的，整体素质不高""** → links occupation and social status with local identity (RL7).
- **""华阳，龙泉也能叫成都？只认五城区哈""** → reflects a socially conventional understanding of core local areas (RL1).
- **""土生土长的本地人""** → refers to family rootedness and generational belonging (RL3).
- **""除了五城区，都是郊区""** → reflects habitual spatial cognition and boundary demarcation (RL1).
- The final sentence critiques those who adopt exclusionary local identity stances and yet behave submissively toward people from ""higher status"" cities — this is **the author’s own position**, and it **resists** the earlier criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The first five statements **do not represent the author’s own views**, but rather **a parody of exclusionary local identity logic**. The author **explicitly critiques** this mindset in the final sentence, implying that such rigid, exclusionary standards of local identity are shallow and hypocritical.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
Although the text includes multiple RL elements (RL1, RL3, RL7), these are **not endorsed by the author** — they are part of a **satirical imitation** of others’ views. The **only endorsed position** is the **critique** of those who rigidly define ""localness"" and yet are servile to outsiders from more ""prestigious"" cities.

Since the **author does not endorse** any of the RL criteria used in the parody, and **resists** the idea of exclusionary local identity definitions, **no RL category applies** to the author's actual stance.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
While the imitated discourse includes multiple RL types, the **author's real stance is a critique** of such exclusionary identity logic, and thus **no RL label should be applied**.

给你讲个笑话，成都土著有优越感，哈哈哈哈哈哈,None,"  
The author presents a sarcastic or mocking tone, making fun of the idea that ""Chengdu natives"" (土著) have a sense of superiority. The statement does not explicitly define who is considered ""local"" or what criteria are used to judge local identity. Instead, it comments on the attitude or self-perception of those who are already recognized as locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (native) implies a sense of deep-rooted local identity.
- The statement mocks the existence of a sense of superiority among locals, but does not propose or endorse any specific standard for defining who is or is not local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author does not provide or endorse any specific criteria (e.g., family rootedness, administrative belonging, spatial cognition, etc.) for defining ""local people."" Instead, they are ridiculing a perceived attitude among some locals, without engaging in the logic of how ""local identity"" should be constructed.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any standard used to define ""local identity."" The text expresses a critical or humorous stance toward a certain group's self-perceived superiority, but does not engage in defining who is or is not local based on any RL criteria.

The author argues that marriage compatibility is primarily determined by **economic conditions and family background**, not by whether someone is a ""local"" (e.g., a Chengdu native). They use examples like ""parents with multiple properties and high pensions"" versus ""parents without pensions who work in agriculture"" to illustrate how **economic status and family resources** are the real criteria for judging compatibility. The author explicitly rejects the relevance of local identity or geographic origin in this context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地土著，父母n套房，退休工资贼高"" (local native, parents with multiple properties and high pensions) → indicates **economic and social assets**.
- ""县城里面务农，父母没得退休金"" (rural farming, parents without pensions) → indicates **lack of economic and social assets**.
- ""婚姻需要门当户对"" (marriage requires matching social/economic status) → **economic and class-based logic**.
- ""挑需不需要娃娃负担养老"" (choosing based on whether the child will have to support the parents in old age) → **family economic burden and stability**.
- The author explicitly says ""跟是不是成都土著没关系"" (has nothing to do with being a Chengdu native) and ""跟地域没得太大的关系"" (not much to do with geography) → **rejects the relevance of local identity markers**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **economic and family asset differences** to explain **how people actually judge compatibility in relationships**, and **explicitly denies** that **local identity** (e.g., being a ""native"") is the standard. The argument is not about defining ""local people"" but about **rejecting the idea that local identity is a meaningful category in social evaluation**, in favor of **economic and family-based criteria**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although economic and family factors are discussed, the author **explicitly denies** that these are being used to define **local identity**—instead, they are used to **critique the relevance of local identity** in social evaluations like marriage. Therefore, **none of the RL categories apply**, because the author is **not endorsing** any standard for defining ""local people,"" but is **rejecting** the idea that such standards (like local origin) are meaningful.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text **does not endorse** any criteria for defining ""local identity."" It **explicitly rejects** the relevance of local identity and instead proposes **economic and family-based criteria** for social evaluation (e.g., marriage). Since the task requires identifying **criteria the author endorses for defining ""local people""**, and the author is **rejecting** such definitions, **no RL categories apply**.

成都人均收入并不高，一个城市全部翻新之后，就把低收入人群赶出去了，没有低收入人群服务，生活成本就上去了，成都的老小区生活便利，低收入人群也住的舒服，包容性很强。,RL5,"  
The author is commenting on the social inclusiveness of Chengdu, especially in its older neighborhoods, where low-income populations can live comfortably and are integrated into the urban fabric. The author critiques the process of urban renewal that displaces low-income groups and raises living costs, implying that the presence and integration of low-income groups contribute to the city’s livability and inclusiveness.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都人均收入并不高"" (Chengdu’s per capita income is not high): economic context, but not directly tied to defining local identity.
- ""低收入人群"" (low-income人群): social group mentioned, but not directly used to define ""local people"" identity.
- ""老小区生活便利"" (old neighborhoods are convenient for living): implies functional livability.
- ""包容性很强"" (highly inclusive): suggests a value judgment about the city or certain areas being socially inclusive, which may relate to how different groups are integrated or accepted within the local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes that Chengdu’s older neighborhoods are livable, convenient, and socially inclusive for low-income groups. While the author does not explicitly define ""local people"" using income level or social class, they do imply that the city’s inclusiveness—especially in older neighborhoods—allows diverse groups (including low-income populations) to coexist and contribute to the local lifestyle. This inclusiveness is portrayed as a desirable quality of ""local"" Chengdu life.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not** define ""local people"" based on income level, occupation, or administrative status.
- The author **does** value the **livability and inclusiveness** of older neighborhoods, which allows a mix of residents, including low-income groups, to live comfortably. This aligns with a **functional and environmental quality-based evaluation** of local areas, rather than a strict boundary-drawing mechanism.
- The term ""包容性很强"" (highly inclusive) implies that these areas are socially and functionally livable for a broad range of people, which supports the **RL5** logic of evaluating areas based on livability and environmental quality.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses the **functional livability and environmental quality** of older neighborhoods as a standard to evaluate the desirability and inclusiveness of local areas. While social inclusiveness is mentioned, it is framed in the context of **what makes a good ""local"" living environment**, not as a separate social-rootedness or class-based criterion.

The author is describing or seeking out older residential communities within the First and Second Ring Roads, built around the year 2000, with a price below 10,000 yuan per square meter. This is primarily a factual or economic inquiry about housing options, focusing on affordability and location.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一二环"" (First and Second Ring Road): a spatial reference, often associated with core urban areas.  
- ""老小区00年那种"" (old residential communities from around 2000): indicates older housing stock, potentially linked to long-term urban residents.  
- ""每平方米一万以下"" (below 10,000 yuan per square meter): an economic criterion, but not directly tied to identity or belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not making a claim about ""local identity"" or defining who is a local person. The text is more of a housing market description or search query, focusing on price, building age, and location. Although the First and Second Ring Road areas may be associated with urban centrality, the author does not explicitly or implicitly link this to standards for defining ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any standard for defining ""local identity."" The text does not discuss belonging, identity, or criteria for judging who is a ""local person.""

The author is discussing the practical and desirable choice of purchasing and renovating a house within Chengdu’s first or second ring road. They emphasize that this choice is shaped by economic conditions (""好多家庭不见得可以拿出一两百万买...房子""), social connections (""朋友也在附近""), and long-term work and life patterns (""我爸妈在成都工作这么久 基本都在一二环内""). This implies a standard for defining what constitutes a ""genuine local"" or a ""desirable local residential area.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Economic capacity to afford property in core areas (""一两百万买...房子"")  
- Property location as a marker of local belonging (""一二环内"")  
- Long-term work and life patterns in the city core (""爸妈...基本都在一二环内"")  
- Social network embeddedness (""朋友也在附近"")  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements collectively support the author’s view that living in the city core—made possible by financial capability, supported by long-term work history, and reinforced by local social networks—represents a more authentic or stable form of local life. This is not just a preference but an implicit standard for evaluating ""localness"" or local quality.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a combination of economic capacity, property location, and social embeddedness as key markers of local identity and residential value. These are not just lifestyle choices but are framed as indicators of who truly belongs or lives in a ""genuine"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text most closely aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author links economic capability, property ownership in core areas, and strong local social ties to a standard for defining or evaluating the authenticity and stability of local identity.

The author is describing a residential area — ""Yitai Tianjiao,"" located near the Second Ring Road. They point out its negative living conditions, such as ""various noises"" and ""high density,"" yet note that ""the price is still very high."" This expresses a sense of confusion or dissatisfaction with the high housing prices despite poor livability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""紧靠二环边"" (close to the Second Ring Road) indicates a core urban location.  
- ""各种噪音和高密度"" (noise and high density) describe poor living environment quality.  
- ""价格就是贵贵贵"" (prices are extremely high) indicates property value and economic pressure.  
- The text contrasts the area's desirability as a location with its poor livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the text discusses location (near the Second Ring Road), it does so to highlight the contradiction between high property prices and poor living conditions. The author does not use this to define ""local people"" or to establish criteria for who counts as local. Instead, they focus on criticizing or expressing frustration with real estate pricing and urban living conditions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** explicitly or implicitly endorse any standard for defining ""local people"" based on the information provided. There is no discussion of identity, belonging, or criteria used to judge who is ""local."" The text is focused on property characteristics and pricing.

The author strongly advocates for living in low-rise, private housing such as townhouses or villas, emphasizing autonomy (""啥都是自己说了算""), safety (""更有安全感""), and functional flexibility (""不住的话也可以开公司开工作室""). They reject high-rise ""large flat"" housing as a ""false improvement, false luxury"" concept. The tone is evaluative and prescriptive, suggesting that certain types of housing represent a more authentic or superior form of local residential identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""楼梯房更有安全感"" – Mentions safety and housing type, which could relate to environmental quality.
- ""大平层就是个伪改善伪豪宅概念"" – Indicates a negative evaluation of a certain housing type, contrasting with the author’s ideal.
- ""有天有地的联排别墅或者独栋别墅"" – Refers to specific types of housing that imply spatial autonomy, land ownership, and higher economic status.
- ""不住的话也可以开公司开工作室"" – Suggests functional flexibility of housing, which links to economic utility and lifestyle rootedness.
- ""三环内的也有六七百个W的"" – Mentions high property value, indicating economic capital and location desirability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses housing type, land access, autonomy, and economic value to define a superior form of local living. This implies a hierarchy of residential legitimacy, where owning a villa-style home in a core area (e.g., within the Third Ring Road) represents a more authentic or ""true"" local lifestyle. This is not just a personal preference but a standard used to evaluate and distinguish ""better"" from ""worse"" forms of local residential identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a standard of residential type and economic capacity as indicators of superior local living. This includes:
- Ownership of land-connected housing (联排 or 独栋别墅) – **RL6: Social Embeddedness** (ownership of embedded local assets).
- Location within the Third Ring Road – **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority** (implied boundary of desirable local space).
- Functional flexibility and autonomy – **RL6: Social Embeddedness** (symbolic and economic control over space).
- High property value – **RL6: Social Embeddedness** (economic status as symbolic of rootedness).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author implicitly defines a ""true local"" lifestyle through the ownership of high-value, land-connected housing in core areas, combined with the social and economic autonomy this affords. This aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** as the dominant category, with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** also playing a role in framing spatial desirability.

The author originally believed that anyone within the administrative boundaries of Harbin, whether from the urban core or the counties, could be considered a ""Harbin person."" However, they encountered a contrasting view on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), which claimed that only people from certain central districts (like Daoli) are ""real"" Harbin locals, while county residents are considered rural and not truly part of the local identity. This contrast reveals the author’s engagement with and reflection on the criteria for defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""只要是哈尔滨辖区内"" (as long as it's within Harbin's jurisdiction) indicates a belief in administrative legitimacy (RL2).
- ""县里的都是农村的，不属于哈尔滨人"" (county people are rural and not real Harbin people) implies a boundary drawn based on perceived urban-rural distinction, possibly involving both spatial cognition and cultural or social exclusion.
- ""老哈尔滨人只有道里的"" (only people from Daoli are true old Harbin locals) reflects a **vernacular spatial boundary**—a socially accepted understanding of which areas are considered the authentic core of local identity (RL1).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is contrasting two different standards for defining ""local identity"": one based on administrative boundaries (which they previously believed), and another based on **habitual, culturally rooted spatial perception** (which others are using to exclude county residents). The author does **not explicitly endorse** the exclusionary view, but they **do present it as a prevailing belief** that challenges their earlier understanding.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **rejects** the idea that county residents are not real Harbin people, indicating they do **not endorse** the exclusionary spatial cognition or cultural boundary logic.
- However, the **existence and influence of this belief** in defining who is considered a ""true local"" is acknowledged and forms part of the author's reflection on local identity.

Crucially, the **author does not personally endorse** the logic that only Daoli residents are ""real"" Harbin locals or that county residents are not part of the local identity. Therefore, **no RL category should be assigned based on resisted or negated criteria**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Although the text mentions both **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) and **vernacular spatial cognition** (RL1), the author ultimately **challenges** the latter and **supports** the former. However, since the task is to identify **criteria the author explicitly endorses or implicitly conveys as valid for defining ""local identity""**, and the author does not **clearly endorse** any one RL category as the standard, **no RL category applies**.

The author implies that there is a meaningful difference between being genuinely from the **core urban district** versus being from the **peripheral county-level areas**, even if both fall under the broader administrative jurisdiction of Harbin (哈市).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- **""属于哈市辖区范围内"" (within the administrative jurisdiction of Harbin)** — points to **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.
- **""挺搞笑的"" (quite funny)** — indicates the author **does not endorse** the idea that just being within the administrative boundary qualifies someone as a ""true local"" of the main urban area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The author **rejects** the idea that mere **administrative belonging** (RL2) is sufficient to claim **local identity** tied to the **main urban area**.
- The author **implies** that **being born and raised in the core urban area** (RL3) or having a **socially recognized connection to the core area** (RL1) is what truly defines a ""local"" of the main city.
- The phrase **""挺搞笑的""** signals that the author **does not endorse** the claim made by those from surrounding counties who assert they are ""main urban locals"" — thus, the author is **not** supporting the idea that all within Harbin are equally ""locals"" of the core.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **only those who are truly rooted in the main urban area** (either through upbringing or long-standing social recognition) can claim to be **authentic locals**.
- Therefore, the author supports a **definition of local identity** based on **family rootedness (RL3)** and **habitual spatial perception (RL1)** — that is, **not everyone within the administrative boundary is equally ""local.""**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- The author emphasizes **a deeper connection to the city core** (not just administrative inclusion) as the standard for local identity.
- This reflects **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** — using socially accepted spatial boundaries (main urban vs. county-level) to define who is ""really"" local.
- It also reflects **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** — emphasizing being ""born and raised"" in the core as a marker of authenticity.

The author clearly states that someone ""肯定不算北京人"" (definitely not a Beijing person), providing two reasons: their accent is not Beijing-style, and their cultural background is different. These are used as criteria to exclude someone from being considered a local (Beijing person).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""说话口音也不像"" (doesn't speak with the same accent) points to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- ""文化背景也不同"" (different cultural background) also points to **cultural identity markers**, which are often linked to regional or local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using linguistic and cultural markers to **draw a boundary** around who counts as a ""local"" (in this case, a Beijing person). Accent and cultural background are treated as **key indicators of insider/outsider status**, and the author implicitly endorses these as valid criteria for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Both accent and cultural background are **explicitly used by the author** to judge whether someone is a ""real"" local. The author **does not resist or question** these criteria—they are used as the **basis for exclusion**.

They oppose the idea of using administrative legitimacy (being part of Harbin's 9 districts and 12 counties) as a way to claim ""Harbin identity."" They also reject identity hierarchies based on labels and emphasize inclusivity and shared effort in city development.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""我家是双城的"" (My family is from Shuangcheng) — suggests rootedness and local identity.
- ""我一直说我是双城人"" — self-identification with a specific local place.
- ""没有说我是哈尔滨"" (I didn't say I'm from Harbin) — resistance to broader administrative identity.
- ""因为口音然后有这种区分争论"" — mentions accent-based distinction, but the author does not endorse it.
- ""按行政归属来说，9区12县的都可以说自己是哈尔滨的"" — mentions administrative legitimacy, but the author seems to reject this logic.
- ""每一个城市的发展都是由在本城市同生活奋斗的人一起共同努力的"" — suggests a broad, inclusive view of local identity based on shared experience, but not explicitly used to define who is ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author **resists** using administrative boundaries (RL2) or linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) to define local identity. They **affirm** a rooted, self-identified local identity tied to Shuangcheng, which reflects **family and historical rootedness** (RL3) and **vernacular spatial awareness** (RL1). However, they **do not explicitly** state that being born and raised there defines local identity in a broader evaluative framework — rather, it's a personal identification. They also **do not use** functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification in defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author affirms their own rooted identity and resists external definitions based on administrative or linguistic criteria. While RL1 and RL3 are **implied**, they are **not explicitly used as evaluative criteria** for defining ""local people"" in general — only for the author’s **own identity**. Since the author does not propose a general standard for defining ""local people,"" but rather resists others' standards, **no RL category is clearly endorsed as a defining logic.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
While the text contains elements related to RL1 and RL3, the author does not explicitly endorse or propose a general standard for defining ""local people"" identity. They only assert their own identity and reject others' definitions. Therefore, **no RL category should be annotated**.

周边县就是不是哈尔滨呀，我爸老家就是宾县，没有人认为宾县=哈尔滨，在那住的也会区分，而且开车要出城，开高速才能到，都说来哈尔滨和回宾县。至于呼兰阿城双城，更不是一个地方了。小时候坐火车到呼兰要一个小时。我姥姥家行政上属于黑河下面的市，但是从来不会认为这是黑河的一部分，都是各叫各的，我也不认为我去过黑河。只有市区才算是这个市啊。,RL1,"  
The author is clearly emphasizing a distinction between ""true city"" and surrounding counties or districts, both in terms of **perceived identity** and **habitual social cognition**. They provide multiple examples (宾县, 呼兰, 阿城, 双城, 黑河) to illustrate that people **do not equate** these areas with the main city (哈尔滨), even when there is an **administrative relationship**. The author also highlights **spatial separation** (e.g., needing to ""drive out of the city"" or ""take the highway"") and **habitual language use** (e.g., ""come to Harbin"" vs. ""go back to Bin County"") as key to how people distinguish between areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical Distinction & Spatial Perception**: Mentions of driving out of the city, taking a highway, and train travel time indicate a **perceived spatial separation**.
- **Social Consensus & Identity Cognition**: ""Nobody thinks Bin County = Harbin,"" ""they distinguish it even if they live there,"" ""we just call them separately"" — these all point to a **shared social perception** about where the city begins and ends.
- **Administrative vs. Perceived Identity**: Explicitly contrasts **administrative归属 (e.g., 黑河)** with **habitual or emotional identification** (""never think of it as part of Heihe"").
- **Core City Concept**: ""Only the urban area counts as the city"" is a **clear symbolic boundary** that defines local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s central argument is that **local identity is not defined by administrative boundaries** (RL2 is explicitly rejected), but rather by **shared, habitual perceptions of space and belonging**. The author uses **spatial separation**, **habitual language**, and **collective cognition** to draw a symbolic boundary around what counts as the ""real city"" and who counts as ""local people."" These are **not just preferences or descriptions**, but **standards used to define local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is clearly endorsed: the author uses **shared perceptions**, **habitual language**, and **emotional/spatial boundaries** to define who and what counts as part of Harbin.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is **explicitly rejected** by the author, so it should **not** be annotated.
- Other RL categories (RL3–RL7) are not discussed or implied in a way that directly defines ""local identity"" in this text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author defines local identity based on **habitual, collective, and symbolic spatial cognition**, not formal administrative lines. This is the **core feature of RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

The author is addressing the issue of who counts as a ""Harbin person"" by contrasting two perspectives: (1) the traditional or habitual perception held by ""old Harbin people"" that only certain historically significant districts (and not the newly added areas) constitute the ""real"" Harbin; and (2) the author's own view that **administrative boundaries should define local identity**, i.e., anyone within the administrative region of Harbin is a Harbin person. The author explicitly rejects using traditional spatial cognition or historical district boundaries to exclude people from local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to traditional spatial perception: ""老哈尔滨人都认为早期的七区……现在是Harbin市区主要包括……其他算郊县"" — this shows **RL1** elements (habitual or historical spatial cognition).
- The author's own view: ""都是中国人，行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人"" — this is a clear endorsement of **RL2** (administrative legitimacy).
- No mention of family history, language, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupation in relation to defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- The author acknowledges the existence of **RL1** logic (habitual spatial认知) but **explicitly rejects it** — thus, it should not be annotated.
- The author **endorses RL2** as the correct standard: administrative legitimacy should determine who is a Harbin person, not historical or habitual perceptions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only **RL2** is endorsed by the author as the legitimate standard for defining ""local identity.""  
RL1 is mentioned but **not endorsed** — the author is critical of it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author clearly defines ""local identity"" based on **administrative boundaries**, rejecting habitual or historical spatial perceptions. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.

Output: RL2"
都是，又不是不属于哈尔滨,None,"  
The author is making a minimal, almost tautological statement — ""They're all part of it, again, it's not like they don't belong to Harbin."" There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any standard for defining ""local identity."" The statement is more about reaffirming general inclusion under the administrative or geographic umbrella of Harbin, without specifying any criteria for what makes someone a ""true"" local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""not不属于 (not不属于 means ""not not belonging"") suggests a basic acknowledgment of belonging, but not a strong claim of local identity.
- There is no mention of generational rootedness, cultural-linguistic traits, administrative legitimacy, spatial cognition, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational symbolism that would indicate a specific standard for defining ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no functional role being played by any RL category — the author is not using any specific logic or standard to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The statement is too neutral and lacks any evaluative or definitional content regarding local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
No RL criteria are endorsed by the author for defining ""local identity."" The author is not proposing or implying any standard for distinguishing ""real"" locals from others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not provide any definitional logic or standard for what constitutes ""local identity,"" none of the RL categories apply.

The author is criticizing a local identity exclusion logic—some ""old Harbin people"" exclude certain districts or counties from being considered ""Harbin,"" which the author finds illogical and incomprehensible. The author questions the legitimacy of this exclusion and implies that such a standard lacks coherence, especially when those excluded are not recognized as belonging to any other city either.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author is responding to a logic that excludes certain administrative areas (districts/counties) from being considered part of Harbin.  
- The author challenges the idea that these areas are not ""really"" part of Harbin, suggesting that administrative belonging should be the key standard.  
- Implicitly, the author opposes defining local identity based on social consensus or symbolic boundaries that exclude officially affiliated areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is pushing back against an identity logic that uses informal or symbolic boundaries (e.g., social perceptions of which areas “count” as local) to exclude others. However, the author does **not** endorse any of the criteria being criticized. Instead, they seem to imply that administrative legitimacy (i.e., whether a place is officially under Harbin) should be the standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse the exclusionary criteria (e.g., symbolic spatial boundaries or social consensus). Rather, they question the logic of those who do, suggesting that administrative affiliation is a more reasonable standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author implicitly endorses **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the correct standard for defining which areas and people belong to Harbin, opposing the use of symbolic or social criteria that exclude officially affiliated areas.

The author is **critiquing** the idea that ""local identity"" in Harbin should be defined by **accent, speech habits, or administrative boundaries**, and they mock the logic of treating such criteria as markers of superiority. They argue instead for a more **inclusive and egalitarian** view of local identity, emphasizing shared geography and upbringing rather than exclusionary standards.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements in the Text:  
- **""用口音腔调以及习惯当身份标尺""** (using accent, tone, and habits as a yardstick for identity) → **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**  
- **""市政惠民政策当作地域分界线""** (treating municipal policies as territorial boundaries) → **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**  
- **""红肠是不是都得查查是不是县里生产的""** (should we check if Harbin red sausage is produced in the county?) → **RL2 (implied) and RL4 (symbolic cultural boundary)**  
- **""冰雪大世界售票规则不过是行政划分的产物""** (Ice Festival ticket rules are just administrative divisions) → **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**  
- **""五区四县同属一座城...都在磕头机旁长大""** (five districts and four counties all belong to one city; children grow up around oil pumps) → **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority (inclusive spatial identity)**

- **""真正的体面，向来与敲键盘贬低他人的姿势成反比""** (true dignity is the opposite of keyboard-based belittlement) → **Rejects RL4 and RL7 (mocks exclusionary identity markers)**

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **explicitly rejects** the use of **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** as **valid or meaningful** criteria for defining ""local identity."" They mock these standards and **advocate instead** for a more **inclusive, shared spatial identity** rooted in the idea that **all parts of the city (urban and rural, county and district)** are equally part of the same local whole.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author **mentions RL2 and RL4**, they **do not endorse** them — in fact, they **strongly criticize** them.  
What the author **does endorse** is:
- A **shared spatial identity** across the entire city region, including counties and districts.
- A **non-hierarchical view of local belonging**, not based on accent, hukou, or administrative labels.

This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author promotes a **socially shared, inclusive perception of spatial belonging** — that all areas are part of one city and that people grow up together regardless of administrative labels.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author **rejects RL2 and RL4**, and **constructs a counter-argument** based on **inclusive spatial identity**, which corresponds to **RL1**.

一个哈尔滨还分起来是不是正不正宗的哈尔滨人了市里的房价也没比我周边县城贵多少什么时候贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧,(none),"  
The author is criticizing the idea of dividing ""authentic"" vs. ""less authentic"" Harbin locals based on local identity markers. They argue that since the price gap between central urban areas and surrounding counties is not large, it's premature to create such identity distinctions. The author implies that significant economic stratification—like in cities such as Beijing or Shanghai—is a prerequisite for such social differentiation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分起来是不是正不正宗的哈尔滨人"" (dividing who is a 'true' Harbin person) suggests a discussion of local identity criteria.  
- ""市里的房价也没比我周边县城贵多少"" (urban area housing prices aren't much higher than surrounding counties) implies economic similarity and lack of spatial economic stratification.  
- The author references economic disparity as a condition for identity stratification (""贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧"" — wait until the wealth gap is as large as in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou before dividing people this way).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing criteria for defining local identity but is instead **rejecting** the idea that one can or should distinguish between ""true"" and ""non-true"" locals. They argue that economic disparity is a necessary condition for such identity divisions, implying that in the absence of such disparity, identity distinctions are unfounded or meaningless.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** any specific standard for defining ""local identity."" Rather, they **reject** the practice of dividing locals based on authenticity. While economic disparity (linked to RL6: Social Embeddedness) is mentioned, it is not used by the author as a standard for defining local identity, but rather as a **condition** under which such identity divisions might become meaningful or justified.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **does not endorse** any specific standard for defining ""local identity,"" and instead **resists** the idea of dividing locals into ""authentic"" and ""non-authentic"" categories, **no RL category applies**.

说嗯呐的不属于哈尔滨市里的,RL4,"  
The author is making a distinction about local identity in Harbin, specifically stating that people who say “嗯呐” (a dialectal expression) are not considered part of “Harbin city proper” (市里). This implies a boundary being drawn between local insiders and others based on linguistic features.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Use of the dialectal expression “嗯呐” (a phonetic representation of a local speech pattern).  
- The phrase “不属于哈尔滨市里的” (not considered part of Harbin city proper) indicates a symbolic boundary being drawn around who is considered truly local.  
- The judgment is based on language use rather than administrative status, family history, or other factors.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using linguistic features — specifically the use of a local dialect expression — to define who is and is not considered a “true” local of Harbin’s core urban area. This reflects a cultural-linguistic boundary marker for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly uses linguistic behavior — specifically the use of a local dialect — as a standard for defining who belongs to the local group (“Harbin city proper”) and who does not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses dialect or speech habits as a boundary marker for local identity.

The author is explaining the historical and spatial logic behind the formation of different ""centers"" in Harbin. They emphasize that the **museum roundabout area** is the **oldest planned city center**, established during the Russian construction phase, due to its alignment with the railway and its concentration of **administrative, cultural, and historical institutions**. The author also distinguishes this from **Old Daowai**, which is the **local people's center**, formed organically by native residents, rather than through official planning. The author is clearly presenting a **socially habitual understanding of spatial hierarchy and local identity** based on historical development patterns.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific areas: **博物馆转盘道 (museum roundabout)**, **中央大街 (Central Street)**, **老道外 (Old Daowai)** — these are spatial identifiers used to distinguish different types of ""centers"".
- Reference to **沙俄建设 (Russian urban planning)**, **铁路 (railway)** — indicates the **historical origin and spatial logic** behind the city's layout.
- Reference to **省政府、市政府、省博物馆、哈工大老楼、教堂 (provincial government, city government, provincial museum, old buildings of HIT, churches)** — symbolic institutions that anchor the **cultural and administrative identity** of the area.
- Reference to **老哈尔滨人聚集区 (concentration of old Harbin residents)** in Old Daowai — indicating a **distinct local-rooted center** shaped by native population settlement, not official planning.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing history or architecture — they are making a **clear distinction between two types of ""local centers""**:
- One is the **officially planned, historically oldest center** (museum roundabout), rooted in Russian planning and administrative/cultural institutions — this reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.
- The other is the **local people's center** (Old Daowai), rooted in **local settlement and organic growth** — this reflects **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

The author does not reject either, but rather **acknowledges both as valid, yet distinct, ways of understanding ""local identity"" through spatial belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that the **oldest, habitually recognized city center** (museum roundabout) is the **symbolic and historical core**, based on shared understanding and institutional presence → **RL1**.
- The author also **acknowledges** that **Old Daowai**, as the **historical settlement of native Harbin residents**, represents a **different but equally meaningful form of local identity** → **RL3**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **two RL categories**:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author defines the museum roundabout as the **socially accepted historical core**, based on shared recognition of its role in city founding, administrative continuity, and cultural landmarks.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author defines **Old Daowai** as the **local people's center**, based on its role as the **historical settlement area of native Harbin residents**, indicating **long-term local rootedness**.

The author reflects on the changing spatial dynamics of urban development in Harbin, discussing how areas like **哈西 (HaXi)**, **群力 (Qunli)**, and **江北 (North Bank)** have evolved differently over time. They contrast this with the decline or stagnation of older urban centers due to demolition costs and urban sprawl. The author also shares a personal anecdote about commuting in **Beijing**, emphasizing how modern transportation (subways, buses) has altered the relevance of traditional urban center living. This discussion implies a **preference for areas with better infrastructure and convenience**, and a **rejection of older notions that equate ""central"" with ""superior""** solely based on historical centrality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1):** The author discusses **how areas like HaXi, Qunli, and Jiangbei are perceived differently over time**, reflecting **habitual or changing social views** on which areas are considered ""in"" or ""out"" of the core urban identity.
- **Functional Livability (RL5):** The author emphasizes **transportation convenience**, **amenities**, and **commute time** as **key criteria** for evaluating where to live and what areas are desirable. This includes **explicit rejection of older urban centers** based on **modern livability standards**.
- **Social Embeddedness (RL6):** Although the author mentions social networks (e.g., friends nearby), these are **not central to their argument** about what defines a desirable or ""local"" area. Hence, **RL6 is not strongly endorsed**.
- **Occupational Typification (RL7), Administrative Legitimacy (RL2), Family Rootedness (RL3), and Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4)** are **not referenced or endorsed** in the context of defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The author **challenges traditional notions** of urban centrality (RL1) by arguing that **modern transportation and infrastructure (RL5)** have **equalized access** and **redefined what makes a place desirable**.
- The author **implicitly defines ""better local areas""** not by their historical status or centrality, but by **functional convenience and livability** — such as **access to transport, commute time, and overall quality of life**.
- They also **contrast their current experience in Beijing** with the **evolving situation in Harbin**, showing that **livability criteria** are **central to how they evaluate and choose where to live**, and by extension, how they define **what constitutes a ""desirable"" or ""genuine"" local area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author discusses changing perceptions of areas like HaXi and Qunli, suggesting that **socially accepted views about which areas are ""central"" or ""desirable"" have shifted**. This is **explicitly endorsed** as part of their reflection on urban identity.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability):** The author **strongly endorses** transportation, commute time, and infrastructure as **the main standards** for evaluating where to live and what areas are ""better."" This is **explicitly linked to their personal experience and broader urban perception**.

The author is reflecting on the historical process of urban expansion and population change in Hefei, emphasizing that **""真正老合肥人"" (true old Hefei locals)** are those whose family roots go back generations, such as their own family that originally came from Feidong and had to **""buy a Hefei hukou""** (administratively become locals). The author implies that **few people today truly qualify as ""old locals""** based on this generational rootedness and administrative history.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""我爷爷辈是肥东的当初来市区还要花钱买合肥户口才行""** (My grandfather's generation was from Feidong and had to pay to get a Hefei hukou) → **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**

- **""合肥人口才一百来万""**, **""我上学是工大附中""**, **""大学墙外就是农村田地""**, **""我们还被人说是郊区的""** → **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** and **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**  
- **""你觉得真的老合肥有多少人""** (How many true old Hefei people do you think there are?) → **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** as the standard for defining ""true locals""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a **definition of ""true local""** based on **long-term family presence in the city**, including **historical migration**, **hukou acquisition**, **place of birth**, and **childhood experiences in the area**. These are not just nostalgic recollections—they are used to **argue that few people today truly qualify as ""old locals""**, which means the author **endorses family rootedness as the standard for defining local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses** the **generational depth of family settlement** and **historical hukou status** as the **core criteria for defining ""true local"" identity**. Although administrative boundaries and spatial perceptions are mentioned, they are used to **support the argument about family historical rootedness**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is describing the demographic reality of Hefei as an immigrant city, emphasizing that many people who are now seen as ""locals"" actually arrived in the 1990s as children and grew up there. They highlight that even though these individuals may be perceived as local due to long-term residence and integration, they are not ""土生土长"" (born and raised here). The author implicitly endorses the idea that long-term upbringing in the city, rather than birthplace or ancestral roots, is the key criterion for being considered local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""合肥一直都是移民城市"" (Hefei has always been a migrant city): background context.
- ""从幼儿园到高中"" (from kindergarten to high school): indicates long-term upbringing in the city.
- ""合肥话都不会讲"" (don't speak Hefei dialect): linguistic-cultural recognition, but not the author's main criterion.
- ""在别人看都是本地的"" (seen by others as local), ""但是其实也不是土生土长的"" (but not truly native): emphasizes that long-term upbringing—not native origin—defines local perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author challenges the idea of ""pure localness"" based on birth or ancestry and instead implies that growing up in the city from an early age (even as a migrant) is what leads to being accepted as local. This reflects a belief in family rootedness or individual growth history as the basis for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that growing up in the city from childhood (even if not born there) is sufficient to form a local identity, aligning with the logic of **RL3: Family Rootedness**, especially in immigrant city contexts where ""local identity"" is formed through long-term upbringing rather than birth or ancestry.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3, as it reflects the author's view that being considered a ""local"" depends on being ""raised here"" from childhood—even if not born there—thus emphasizing family historical rootedness or individual growth history as the basis for local identity.

发展起来的晚，年纪大一点的普遍受文化教育水平不高，很多拆迁户（没有歧视的意思，但确实老年人较多 素质确实有待提高）,RL6,"  
The author is describing a demographic and developmental characteristic of a certain area — that it ""developed later,"" leading to an older population with generally lower levels of education. They also mention a high number of ""demolition resettlement households"" (拆迁户), noting that this group tends to be older and, in their view, ""has room for improvement in terms of quality"" (素质有待提高). Although the author adds a disclaimer (""no discriminatory intent""), they still imply a judgment about this population's social or cultural status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Developed later"" implies a historical timeline and potentially a different social trajectory from ""older"" urban areas.  
- ""普遍受文化教育水平不高"" (generally low educational attainment) suggests cultural or social attributes.  
- ""Many demolition resettlement households"" indicates a specific socio-economic background, often associated with rural-to-urban migration or displacement due to urban expansion.  
- ""素质有待提高"" (quality needs improvement) implies an evaluative standard being applied to this group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a distinction between this group and presumably more ""established"" urban residents. Although not explicitly defining ""local identity,"" the implication is that these people — due to their background, education level, and possibly behavior — do not fully ""belong"" to the local urban identity or do not represent its ideal form. This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which involves evaluating people based on their social and economic integration, rootedness, and perceived status within the local context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **educational level, socio-economic background (e.g., demolition resettlement), and perceived personal quality** are relevant standards for evaluating who belongs to the ""true"" or ""ideal"" local population. These are not administrative, linguistic, or rootedness-based criteria, but rather **social and economic indicators of embeddedness and status**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text fits **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as it reflects the author's view that people with certain socio-economic backgrounds (e.g., demolition resettlement households, lower education levels) are seen as less rooted or less integrated into the local urban identity, and thus not fully ""local"" in a socially recognized sense.

Output: RL6"
还有交通特别乱，机动车从不让行人，电动车逆行，到处乱窜不遵守交通规则,(none),"  
The author is describing traffic chaos and disorder, mentioning that motor vehicles don't yield to pedestrians, electric bikes ride against traffic, and there is general disregard for traffic rules. However, this is a **description of behavioral phenomena** rather than a statement about how ""local identity"" is defined.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of traffic behavior and rule-breaking (motor vehicles, electric bikes).
- No explicit or implicit link to defining ""local people"" or evaluating areas based on identity criteria.
- No reference to spatial cognition, administrative belonging, family history, language, livability as a standard for local identity, social integration, or occupational typification.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no functional role** related to defining ""local identity"" in this statement. The author is **not** proposing or endorsing any standard for who counts as ""local"" or what makes a place ""local."" The focus is solely on criticizing traffic behavior.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL categories apply because the author is not using any of the criteria to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The statement is purely about traffic conditions and behavior, not about identity boundaries or belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text **does not meet the criteria** for any RL category. It lacks any reference to standards or logic the author uses to define or evaluate ""local identity.""

The author is providing objective real estate information—location details (near Xuehe Metro Station, in the eastern part of the government affairs area in Baohe District, around the Second Ring Road in Hefei), specific property names (Cinda, Greenland), and approximate price levels (around 20,000 RMB per square meter). There is **no explicit or implicit discussion about what constitutes a ""local person"" or how to define ""local identity.""**

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Location references** (e.g., ""Nan’erhuan,"" ""Baohe District,"" ""Xuehe Metro Station"") relate to geography but are used descriptively, not evaluatively.
- **Property developers and prices** (e.g., ""Cinda,"" ""Greenland,"" ""20,000 RMB"") describe real estate market conditions, not identity or belonging criteria.
- **No mention of identity markers**, cultural traits, administrative status, family history, language, social networks, or occupation is made in the context of defining ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument** about local identity or criteria for defining ""local"" people. The text is **purely informational**, focusing on property details and pricing. The author does not express any evaluative standard or logic regarding who is considered ""local"" or what makes a place ""truly local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since there is **no discussion or endorsement of any criteria** related to defining ""local identity,"" **no RL category applies.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This is a **neutral real estate listing or description** without any evaluative or normative claims about ""local identity."" Therefore, **no RL category is applicable.**

The author emphasizes that they grew up in **Luyang District** and believe that **accent** is the easiest way to distinguish local identity, especially when one has enough exposure. They further mention that **appearance and demeanor** can also be used to identify regional differences, noting that people from different regions have **distinct physical traits**, and that some individuals can even pinpoint origins down to **specific provinces**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我是庐阳区读书长大的"" (""I grew up studying in Luyang District"") implies a **personal rootedness** and **local upbringing**, pointing toward **RL3**.  
- ""口音最容易分辨的"" (""accent is the easiest to distinguish"") clearly refers to **linguistic-cultural recognition**, aligning with **RL4**.  
- ""长相气质"" (""appearance and demeanor""), ""不同地域人外貌特点差异很明显"" (""people from different regions have very noticeable physical differences"") refers to **visual stereotyping** used to identify **regional origins**, which can be **an extension of cultural recognition**, though not directly a listed RL.  
- The ability to distinguish people down to **""周边两三个省份的程度""** (""within two or three neighboring provinces"") again reinforces the idea of **cultural and linguistic recognition** as a refined skill.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **accent** and **appearance** as tools to distinguish **local vs. non-local identity**, with **accent** being the most reliable and accessible. Their upbringing in Luyang District provides them with the **linguistic and cultural familiarity** to make these distinctions. This implies a **deep cultural-linguistic embeddedness** that supports their ability to judge local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** accent as a **valid and accessible marker of local identity**, and also **implicitly accepts** physical appearance and demeanor as **additional, though less precise, indicators**.  
While the **upbringing in Luyang District** suggests a **RL3** element, the author does not **explicitly use this to define local identity**—rather, it serves as a **background condition** that enables their linguistic recognition ability.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text most directly reflects **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author explicitly endorses **accent** as a **criterion for identifying localness**. The mention of **appearance and regional physical differences** supports this but does not map to a separate RL category on its own. The **personal rootedness in Luyang District** supports the linguistic recognition but is not used as the **primary standard** for defining local identity.

Output: RL4"
啊？我03年的，我妹12年的，我们一家人平时交流都是合肥土话周围的亲戚基本上也都讲合肥话,RL4,"  
The author is emphasizing that their family, across generations (from 2003 to 2012), communicates in the local Hefei dialect (""合肥土话""), and that surrounding relatives also speak Hefei dialect. This implies that the use of the local dialect is a shared cultural practice within their family and extended kin, contributing to a sense of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""平时交流都是合肥土话"" (we speak Hefei dialect in daily communication) indicates linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""周围的亲戚基本上都讲合肥话"" (relatives nearby also speak Hefei dialect) reinforces the cultural-linguistic boundary marker.  
- The family's consistent use of the local dialect suggests cultural continuity and local rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly presents speaking the local dialect as a marker of belonging and shared identity. The use of dialect is not just a linguistic preference but a shared cultural practice that defines the family's connection to the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses speaking the local dialect (""合肥土话"") as a criterion for cultural and local identity, indicating that dialect use is a key part of what makes someone part of the local group.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses the criterion of speaking the local dialect as a marker of local identity and cultural belonging.

Output: RL4"
所以这和小黑子有什么关系？房价网上查不到？,None,"  
The author is responding to a previous comment or question (possibly involving criticism or accusation), and they are dismissing the relevance of ""little trolls"" (小黑子) to the current discussion. They also point out that housing prices can be easily looked up online, implying that the discussion should focus on factual or practical matters rather than personal attacks or irrelevant issues.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小黑子"" (a derogatory term for online trolls or critics)  
- ""房价"" (housing prices)  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Neither ""小黑子"" nor ""房价"" are used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The mention of housing prices does not serve to establish a standard for who is considered ""local"" or to define the characteristics of a ""local"" area. The term ""小黑子"" is used to dismiss irrelevant or malicious commentary, not to construct a boundary of local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no endorsement or use of any criteria related to defining ""local identity"" in this statement. The author is not proposing or implying any standard for judging who is ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not express any view that defines or evaluates ""local identity"" or its criteria, **no RL category applies**.

Output: None"
哈哈，新来的都在疯狂踩老城区，因为他们恰好赶上的房价最高的那一波,RL3,"  
The author is mocking new arrivals who ""step on"" or look down upon the old city, implying that these newcomers are recent beneficiaries of high housing prices. The tone suggests that the author associates long-term presence or rootedness in the city (possibly in the old城区) with authentic local identity, while viewing recent arrivals—motivated by property speculation or high-value investment—as outsiders who lack this foundational connection.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""新来的"" (newcomers): indicates a contrast between those who are newly arrived and those who are established.
- ""疯狂踩老城区"" (frantically stepping on the old city): implies a dismissive or disrespectful attitude from newcomers toward the old city.
- ""恰好赶上的房价最高的那一波"" (恰好赶上了 high housing price wave): links the newcomers' status to a specific economic event (high property prices), suggesting they are not deeply rooted but rather temporarily benefitting from market conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a boundary between ""newcomers"" and ""locals"" (possibly those who have lived in the area longer), using the contrast in timing of arrival and relation to housing prices as a marker of legitimacy in local identity. The mockery of newcomers suggests that the author values historical rootedness or long-term presence in defining who truly ""belongs.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **family rootedness or long-term presence** (in contrast to recent arrivals who are only in the city for economic gain) as a standard for authentic local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author's argument hinges on a contrast between those who are newly arrived (and thus not truly ""local"") and those who presumably have a longer-standing, more authentic connection to the area—likely through long-term residence or generational ties.

The author is comparing the cost of living between Shanghai and Hefei, noting that basic daily expenses like groceries (e.g., seafood, beef, pork ribs) are not significantly different. They also mention that while dining out can be expensive in both cities depending on the venue, and that they lived in Hefei’s government district (now known as a central urban area) about ten years ago, frequenting places like Swan Lake and MixC万象城, which are associated with high-end consumption and modern urban life. The author implies that despite lower housing prices, Hefei is not necessarily a cheaper or less ""urban"" city in terms of lifestyle and consumption habits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Geographical references:** Mentions of specific areas like “政务区” (government district), “天鹅湖” (Swan Lake), “万象城” (MixC) — these are symbolic urban landmarks associated with modernity and high-end urban life.
- **Consumption habits and lifestyle:** References to dining, buying meat, going to malls — these indicate a middle-class urban lifestyle.
- **Housing prices:** Explicitly notes that Hefei has an advantage in housing affordability compared to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.
- **Implicit evaluation of urban quality:** The author emphasizes that consumption levels in Hefei are not low and that the city offers a modern urban lifestyle, suggesting a positive evaluation of Hefei’s urban identity and livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is arguing that Hefei, while more affordable, is not a ""lower-tier"" city in terms of lifestyle and consumption. They use examples of daily life, consumption patterns, and the presence of modern urban amenities to suggest that Hefei is comparable to Shanghai in terms of ""urban"" or ""local"" lifestyle quality. The mention of specific urban landmarks implies that the author associates these with a sense of local modernity and identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that lifestyle, consumption habits, and access to modern urban amenities are important in evaluating the quality of a local area and its residents. These are not just personal preferences but are used to argue that Hefei should not be seen as a less ""urban"" or less ""local"" city compared to Shanghai.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the city based on consumption patterns, lifestyle, and the presence of modern urban amenities (e.g., malls, dining, public spaces) as part of what constitutes a desirable or ""truly urban"" local area.

土生土长合肥人表示14年以前根本舍不得离开合肥，好爱这个城市，14年以后越来越不爱在合肥待着了，每年想办法溜出去给自己放假，感觉每个城市都比合肥新鲜，没有繁杂的交通环境，不用走在过个马路和各种电瓶车碰撞,RL3,"  
The author identifies as a ""土生土长合肥人"" (native Hefei person), indicating a strong family rootedness and personal growth history in Hefei. They express a shift in emotional attachment over time—from deep love and attachment before 2014 to a growing desire to leave the city after that point due to deteriorating urban conditions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长合肥人"" clearly indicates family rootedness and long-term personal growth in Hefei (RL3).
- The author mentions ""繁杂的交通环境"" (complex traffic environment), ""电瓶车碰撞"" (collision with electric scooters), and a preference for other cities' freshness and better urban conditions. These reflect dissatisfaction with functional livability (RL5), but the author does **not** use these to define who is or isn't a ""local"" person.
- The emotional shift is about personal feelings toward the city, not about who counts as local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's identity as a native Hefei person is central to their sense of belonging and emotional connection to the city. However, the discussion of urban decline and personal preference for other cities does **not** imply a new standard for defining ""local people""—it's about their changing feelings toward the city, not who belongs there.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only the ""土生土长合肥人"" part reflects a standard the author uses to define their own ""local"" identity. The discussion of traffic and urban conditions, while evaluative, is **not** used by the author to define who is or isn't a local person.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects RL3, as the author defines their own local identity through being born and raised in Hefei. Other elements are about personal preferences or urban quality, not identity criteria.

合肥土著人，感觉合肥的名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城以后，面积大了不少，交通也在变的便捷，相应的民生政策并没有积极跟上，希望越来越好，做到真正的宜居,RL5,"  
The author identifies as a Hefei native (""合肥土著人"") and reflects on how the city's image has evolved—from being known as the ""hometown of Bao Zheng"" to ""a famous city by the lake."" They note that the city has expanded in size and improved in transportation, but they express concern that related livelihood policies have not kept pace. The author hopes for future improvement and that Hefei can become truly livable.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""合肥土著人"" (native of Hefei): implies a sense of rootedness or local identity.  
- ""名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城"" (the city’s image changed from ""Bao Zheng's hometown"" to ""a famous city by the lake""): reflects a shift in symbolic identity.  
- ""面积大了不少，交通也在变的便捷"" (larger area, more convenient transportation): relates to functional livability.  
- ""民生政策并没有积极跟上"" (livelihood policies haven't kept up): indicates concern for quality of life and governance.  
- ""希望越来越好，做到真正的宜居"" (hope for it to become truly livable): directly expresses a standard or aspiration for what constitutes a desirable ""local"" city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author identifies as a native and reflects on the city’s changing image, the core of their argument centers on the city’s livability and its potential to become a truly desirable place to live. The author evaluates Hefei not just in terms of its historical or cultural identity, but in terms of whether it meets the standard of being a ""livable"" city, which they associate with quality of life, infrastructure, and policy support.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author identifies as a native, they do not explicitly or implicitly define ""local people"" based on ancestry, language, or administrative status. Instead, they focus on the city's development and its ability to provide a high quality of life. The author endorses the idea that a ""true"" or desirable local city must be livable, tying this to their vision of Hefei’s future.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the city in terms of its material infrastructure (transportation), environmental appeal (lake), and quality of life (livability), and explicitly links these to what they believe a ""true"" local city should be.

The author is discussing broader urban management challenges in Hefei, such as traffic and parking issues due to rapid population growth. They also note that, unlike in Shenzhen, traditional ""local people"" in Hefei have not benefited much from rising housing prices, and are being economically outpaced by ""new Hefei people"" composed of outsiders. This suggests that **economic and property-related dynamics** are being used to evaluate who truly benefits from and belongs to the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""本地人"" (locals) vs. ""外地人组成新合肥人"" (new Hefei people made up of outsiders) – identity distinction based on origin.
- ""很少吃到房价上涨带来的资产增加"" (rarely benefit from asset gains due to rising housing prices) – implies property ownership and economic benefit are markers of local advantage.
- ""竞争力相对不足"" (relatively less competitive) – suggests a hierarchy of local status based on economic and asset-based integration.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not merely describing economic inequality or urban problems; they are **contrasting traditional locals with new arrivals who are more economically integrated or empowered**, suggesting that **economic position and property ownership are now key markers of local status** in a changing urban context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author implies that **economic integration and asset ownership (especially housing)** are now key to being a ""true local"" or having a meaningful stake in the city, and that traditional locals are falling behind in this new standard. This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which includes **possession of embedded local assets (like property), economic integration, and social capital** as indicators of local belonging or status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text aligns with **RL6** because the author uses **economic status, property ownership, and competitive positioning in the local housing market** as implicit criteria for evaluating who is a meaningful or empowered ""local"" in the evolving urban context of Hefei.

Output: RL6"
有一说一之前去合肥，当地的阜阳口音是真的正宗啊,RL4,"  
The author is making an observation about the **authenticity of the Fuyang accent** they encountered in Hefei. The phrase ""有一说一"" (to speak frankly) signals that the author is offering an honest impression. The key point is their emphasis on the **""authenticity"" or ""typical nature"" of the local dialect**, which implies a cultural-linguistic standard for identifying localness or insider status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""阜阳口音"" (Fuyang accent) directly points to **linguistic recognition**.
- ""正宗"" (authentic) implies a **value judgment or recognition of local linguistic identity**.
- The statement is framed as a **cultural observation**, not a rejection or critique, indicating **implicit endorsement** of the idea that accent is a meaningful marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing a sound difference; they are **highlighting the presence of a distinct local linguistic identity**, which functions as a **symbolic boundary** for distinguishing locals from non-locals. The use of ""正宗"" further suggests that the accent is being used as a **benchmark or standard** for judging authenticity of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly **accepts and uses linguistic features (accent)** as a **marker of local identity**. There is no indication of resistance or critique toward this logic, and the tone suggests **recognition and endorsement** of this standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, which identifies **dialect, accent, or cultural speech habits** as boundary markers for local identity. The author uses the **authenticity of the Fuyang accent** as a standard to evaluate or recognize localness.

Output: RL4"
我老家也是大圩的欸，不过好像大圩拆迁房的房价并不高吧，是什么葡萄家园吧,N/A,"  
The author mentions having a hometown in **Daxu**, and refers to **""demolition housing"" (拆迁房)** in Daxu having relatively low housing prices, specifically naming an affordable housing project **""Putao Jiayuan"" (葡萄家园)**. While this reflects some awareness of local housing conditions, the tone is more descriptive and neutral rather than evaluative. There is no explicit or implicit judgment that such housing or its residents define or fail to define ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""My hometown is also Daxu""** – suggests a personal connection to the area, potentially related to **RL3 (Family Rootedness)**.
- **""Demolition housing"" and ""Putao Jiayuan""** – reference housing type and affordability, potentially touching on **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** or **RL5 (Functional Livability)**.
- However, the author does **not** suggest that housing price, housing type, or place of origin are **standards for defining local identity**. The statement remains **descriptive**, not evaluative or normative.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument** being made about who counts as ""local"" or what defines ""local identity."" The author is **not endorsing** any standard for local identity, nor are they **critiquing** or **resisting** any such standard. The tone is casual and observational.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does **not make any evaluative claim** about ""local identity"" or endorse any specific criteria for defining it, **no RL category applies**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
None of the RL categories apply because the text does **not engage with or endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity.""** It simply references a personal connection and a housing project without linking these to identity standards.

The author is criticizing the idea that owning a small property or receiving拆迁 (relocation) benefits equates to becoming wealthy or gaining significant financial advantage. They argue that the value of such housing is limited due to poor marketability (""根本没人买"") and that monthly subsidies are minimal. The tone is dismissive and skeptical toward the notion that such assets confer local advantage or legitimacy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of housing (""60平米"", ""多15平米"", ""房价在这里"") relate to property ownership and size.  
- Financial aspects: ""自己掏钱买的平方"", ""多8万来块钱"", ""租房补助"", ""人头补助"" — all indicate economic compensation or investment.  
- ""朋友大铺头拆迁"" refers to relocation compensation, a form of embedded local asset or social benefit.  
- The author questions the real value of these benefits, suggesting they don't equate to meaningful local advantage.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not** endorsing property ownership,拆迁 benefits, or financial subsidies as meaningful markers of local identity. Instead, they are **dismissing** the idea that these elements provide real status or belonging. There is no endorsement of administrative belonging, rootedness, cultural recognition, or functional livability as defining local identity. The focus is on economic disappointment and lack of real value in these benefits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse any of the RL criteria as defining ""local identity"" — they are criticizing the idea that property or subsidies grant local legitimacy or status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does **not** endorse any criteria as defining ""local identity"" and is instead **rejecting** the idea that property, subsidies, or relocation benefits confer meaningful local status, **no RL category applies**.

说实话，我们这一代当时强制普及普通话，天天做这个黑板报，我们能听懂合肥话，但是说出来总是怪怪的，我妈还问我是哪里的口音,RL4,"  
The author reflects on their generational experience of being forced to speak Mandarin, which weakened their ability to naturally use or feel comfortable speaking the local dialect (Hefei dialect). Although they can understand the local dialect, they feel awkward when speaking it, and even their mother questions their accent. This implies that dialect use and linguistic authenticity are standards for judging local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""强制普及普通话"" (mandatory promotion of Mandarin) indicates a policy context that weakened local dialect use.  
- ""能听懂合肥话，但是说出来总是怪怪的"" (can understand Hefei dialect but speaking it feels awkward) shows a lack of linguistic fluency/cultural familiarity.  
- ""我妈还问我是哪里的口音"" (my mom even asked me where my accent is from) highlights the symbolic boundary drawn by accent in identifying localness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's discomfort with the local dialect and the confusion from their own family about their accent imply that linguistic-cultural recognition (specifically, accent and dialect fluency) is a standard used—by the author and others—for judging whether someone is truly a ""local."" This is not just about understanding the language, but about being perceived as belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly acknowledges that dialect and accent are criteria used to judge local identity, and they express a sense of linguistic alienation from the local community, reinforcing the importance of this standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses dialect fluency and accent as implicit criteria for determining local identity.

合肥四个行政区啊，为什么合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区,RL1,"  
The author is questioning why Hefei residents often refer to the High-Tech Zone as an administrative district when it is not officially one of the four main administrative districts of Hefei. This reflects a concern with how people cognitively categorize and label urban spaces, particularly in contrast to official administrative boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to ""four administrative districts"" (official administrative structure).
- Mention of ""High-Tech Zone"" being treated as an administrative district by locals.
- Implicit contrast between official administrative legitimacy and local perception of spatial identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is pointing out a discrepancy between formal administrative divisions and the way local people mentally map or label areas of the city. This reflects a socially habitual or symbolic understanding of spatial categorization, which is used to define or identify ""local"" areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implies that local people's perception of高新区 (High-Tech Zone) as an administrative district reflects a shared or habitual spatial cognition, even if it is not officially recognized. This habitual perception is used to define or symbolically mark local identity or belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author highlights how local people use symbolic or habitual understandings of urban space—rather than official administrative boundaries—to define or label areas, which in turn reflects a form of local identity or belonging.

因为高新区有自己的学区啊，而且管委会管理行政事务，居民办事也不去蜀山区啊，房产证也是高新区，就一个身份证是蜀山区,RL2,"  
The author is emphasizing the distinct administrative and residential identity of the High-Tech Zone (高新区). They point out that the area has its own school district, administrative management (through a management committee), and property registration — all of which function independently from Shushan District (蜀山区). The only remaining administrative link to Shushan is through the ID card registration. This implies that the author sees administrative boundaries and governance structures as central to defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""高新区有自己的学区"" (High-Tech Zone has its own school district): points to administrative and educational jurisdiction.  
- ""管委会管理行政事务"" (Management Committee handles administrative affairs): highlights an independent administrative body.  
- ""居民办事也不去蜀山区"" (Residents don't go to Shushan District for administrative services): further reinforces administrative separation.  
- ""房产证也是高新区"" (Property deeds are under High-Tech Zone): property registration under a specific administrative entity.  
- ""身份证是蜀山区"" (ID card is under Shushan District): indicates a lingering administrative categorization that conflicts with actual local governance.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is arguing that, despite the ID card still being registered under Shushan District, the High-Tech Zone operates with its own administrative legitimacy in almost all practical aspects — from education to property rights to daily governance. This suggests that the author believes **administrative legitimacy**, not just formal hukou or ID registration, should be the standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **actual administrative governance and institutional affiliation (school districts, property registration, administrative services)** should be the basis for defining local identity, even if it conflicts with older or residual administrative labels (like ID card registration).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author is using **official jurisdiction, administrative function, and institutional affiliation** (rather than just formal hukou or ID card registration) to define who or what area counts as ""local.""

没说不宜居 瑶海庐阳都很宜居 我在瑶海生活五六年 买东西真的很方便 但是发展比较好的区确实包河和蜀山更强些,RL5,"  
The author is evaluating different districts in Hefei (瑶海, 庐阳, 包河, 蜀山) in terms of livability and development level. While they affirm that瑶海and庐阳are ""very livable,"" they also express that districts like包河and蜀山are ""stronger in development."" This implies a comparative standard of ""local area quality"" based on functional livability and environmental amenities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""宜居"" (livable), ""买东西真的很方便"" (very convenient for shopping) — indicators of functional livability (RL5).  
- ""发展比较好的区"" (better-developed districts), ""更强些"" (stronger) — evaluative terms that suggest a hierarchy of local areas based on development and livability.  
- The author's personal experience living in瑶海for 5–6 years adds a subjective dimension to the evaluation of local areas, but not necessarily tied to family roots or administrative legitimacy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses livability and development level as a standard to evaluate and differentiate the quality of ""local"" areas. While瑶海is acknowledged as convenient and livable, the author still sees包河and蜀山as superior, implying that these areas meet a higher standard of ""local"" desirability.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses functional livability — including convenience of amenities and perceived development level — as a standard for evaluating ""local"" areas and, by implication, who lives in them.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL5, which evaluates areas based on functional livability and environmental quality, and links that evaluation to the author's perception of ""local"" area hierarchy and desirability.

The author provides an objective description of life in Xinzhan (New Station), mentioning its convenience due to multiple subway lines and the fact that it has ""市区产证"" (urban district property certificate), indicating administrative legitimacy. They also describe the area's environment and industrial orientation, mentioning large factories as the economic backbone. However, the author points out that high-end facilities like five-star hotels are not relevant to ordinary people, implying a certain functional and social evaluation of the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""生活挺方便的 有地铁1号线 三号线 四号线"" (convenient life with Metro Lines 1, 3, and 4) → RL5 (Functional Livability).  
- ""市区产证"" (urban district property certificate) → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).  
- Mention of industrial zones and major factories (京东方, 维信诺, 康宁) → RL7 (Occupational Typification).  
- ""磨店那个商业街...平时没什么人"" (commercial street is usually empty) → RL5 (Functional Livability), as it implies limited livability or vibrancy.  
- ""五星级酒店和普通人也没太大关系"" (five-star hotels are not relevant to ordinary people) → RL6 (Social Embeddedness), suggesting a disconnect from broader social or economic embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author primarily describes the area in terms of its administrative status (市区产证), transportation convenience, and industrial character. These are used to evaluate the area's status and desirability as a local living space. The mention of industrial employment centers and underutilized amenities implies a functional and socioeconomic hierarchy of local areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses or at least affirms the relevance of:
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):**市区产证 is used to affirm the area's status as part of the urban core.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability):** Subway access and general convenience are highlighted as positives, while the underdeveloped commercial scene and limited vibrancy are noted as limitations.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The area's reliance on major factories is mentioned as a defining feature, though not explicitly used to define local identity, it does shape the area's character.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2:** The author affirms the administrative legitimacy of Xinzhan as part of the urban core (""市区产证""), which contributes to its identity as a local area.
- **RL5:** The author evaluates the area based on functional aspects such as subway access and commercial vibrancy, which are used to assess the area's livability and thus its local identity value.
- **RL7:** While not the main focus, the author implicitly acknowledges that the area's industrial character (anchored by large factories) contributes to its social and economic identity, which indirectly informs how people perceive its localness.

合肥土著告诉你，政务区只是从经济上划分的独立区域，行政上依然是属于蜀山区。往大了说就像深圳和国家的关系一样，深圳是经济特区的同时，它也是国家的城市区域，但它代表不了国家（ps：包括大部分合肥本地人提到天鹅湖都是说蜀山区天鹅湖）,RL2,"  
The author, identifying as a ""Hefei native"" (合肥土著), aims to clarify the relationship between **administrative boundaries** and **economic-functional zones** in defining local identity. They emphasize that although the **Government District (政务区)** has a special economic status, it is still **administratively part of Shushan District**, not an independent entity. The author further supports this by drawing an analogy to **Shenzhen's relationship with the nation**, suggesting that economic prominence does not equate to independent identity. Additionally, they note that most locals refer to **Swan Lake** using the **Shushan District** label, reinforcing the importance of administrative identity in local self-perception.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""政务区...行政上依然是属于蜀山区"" — clear reference to **administrative legitimacy**.  
- ""深圳和国家的关系"" — analogy used to explain how economic identity does not override administrative归属.  
- ""大部分合肥本地人提到天鹅湖都是说蜀山区天鹅湖"" — shows how locals **linguistically and cognitively align** with administrative identity rather than functional or economic zones.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **administrative boundaries** as the **primary standard** for defining local identity. They explicitly reject the idea that economic zoning (like the Government District) can redefine local belonging. The mention of local speech habits further reinforces that **administrative identity is deeply embedded in local consciousness** and used as a standard for self-identification.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** administrative division as the **legitimate and preferred standard** for defining local identity. They **reject** the idea that economic or functional zoning should override this standard.  
The reference to local speech patterns also implies **linguistic-cultural recognition**, but it serves a **supporting role** to reinforce the administrative identity logic, not as an independent standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses administrative boundaries and jurisdictional归属as the **core logic** for defining who or what belongs to the local identity. While linguistic-cultural recognition is present, it does not function as an independent standard in this case.

The author is explaining the administrative and functional structure of the city, specifically the relationship between the政务区 (Government Affairs District) and 蜀山区 (Shushan District). They clarify that the政务区 is a functional area, not an administrative one, and is administratively part of Shushan District. This is a **neutral, descriptive explanation** of how the city is organized administratively versus functionally.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""政务区是功能区"" (the Government Affairs District is a functional area)  
- ""蜀山是行政区"" (Shushan is an administrative district)  
- ""政务区归属于蜀山区"" (the Government Affairs District belongs to Shushan District)  
- ""功能区只是方便市里管理做的划分"" (functional areas are just divisions made for easier city management)

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not** expressing any evaluative or identity-based criteria for defining ""local people."" They are **describing the administrative-functional distinction**, not making any claims about who counts as a local, or what defines local identity. There is **no endorsement of any standard** for identifying locals, nor is there any implicit or explicit boundary-drawing around local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is **no endorsement** of any identity-defining standard. The text is purely **administrative and descriptive**, and does **not engage with the concept of ""local identity""** in any evaluative or definitional way.

The author is expressing curiosity and mild skepticism about claims that ""Binhu is livable"" and ""has convenient facilities for eating, drinking, and entertainment."" While they acknowledge that some people praise Binhu, they personally know people living there who describe it as spacious but sparsely populated, lacking in vibrant commercial areas. The author seems to be questioning the accuracy or universality of the ""livable Binhu"" narrative.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Binhu is livable"" (滨湖宜居) – mentions livability.  
- ""Eating, drinking, entertainment convenient"" (吃喝玩乐都方便) – mentions functional convenience.  
- ""Place is big but people are few"" (地方大是大，但是人好少) – describes low population density.  
- ""No good commercial areas"" (没什么好的商业圈) – comments on lack of amenities.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing** the idea that Binhu is a desirable or representative ""local"" area based on its livability. Instead, they are **questioning** whether the positive claims about Binhu's livability are true across the entire area. The author contrasts others' praise with their own observations and those of their acquaintances, suggesting that the area may not meet the standard of being a ""livable"" or ""desirable"" local area. Therefore, the discussion of functional livability is **not used by the author to define local identity or to judge who is ""local""**, but rather to express doubt about a prevailing perception.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL elements are **explicitly or implicitly endorsed** by the author as valid criteria for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local"" areas. The author is not making a claim about who counts as local or what makes a true local area, but rather expressing confusion or doubt about the reputation of Binhu.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not endorsing any standard for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local"" areas, and is instead expressing skepticism about the livability claims of a certain area, **no RL category applies**.

The author provides a nuanced discussion of how ""development"" can be defined differently depending on perspective—government performance, employment opportunities, personal living experience, and functional livability. The final section emphasizes personal experience and functional convenience as the most meaningful indicators of development, especially from the perspective of long-term residents within the ""护城河内"" (inner moat area). These residents are portrayed as having a distinct identity rooted in lifestyle, convenience, and a familiar, tight-knit community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** ""护城河内"" (inner moat area) and the contrast with ""外围"" (peripheral areas) suggest a habitual, culturally meaningful spatial boundary used to distinguish ""real locals"" from others.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability):** The author emphasizes functional aspects such as proximity to schools, hospitals, convenience of daily life, and neighborhood familiarity as key to their quality of life and perception of development.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** References to ""单位大院邻里"" (work unit compound neighbors), ""熟人圈"" (acquaintance circle), and mutual help among neighbors indicate a sense of embedded local social networks and community.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** While the author discusses高新区 (High-tech Zone) in terms of personal effort and employment, this is framed as a general perspective and not directly tied to the author’s own definition of local identity or belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author defines what it means to be a ""real local"" not by economic output or government metrics, but by **habitual spatial identity** (""护城河内""), **functional convenience**, and **deeply embedded social networks**. These are the standards the author implicitly endorses for what constitutes a meaningful, authentic local life.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **clearly endorses**:
    - The symbolic boundary of ""护城河内"" (inner moat area) vs. peripheral areas (RL1).
    - The **functional convenience and livability** (RL5) of daily life as a standard for evaluating local quality and identity.
    - The **presence of strong local social networks** (RL6) as a marker of authentic local living.
- RL7 (occupational typification) is mentioned in a general way but not used by the author to define local identity in their own argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1** is reflected in the habitual boundary of ""护城河内"" used to define who belongs to the ""real local"" community.
- **RL5** is endorsed through the emphasis on daily functional convenience (schools, hospitals, walkability) as the standard for meaningful local development and identity.
- **RL6** is present in the description of embedded local social networks and neighborly support as part of the local lifestyle.

The author expresses strong satisfaction with the residential environment of **Oaks Bay (橡树湾)** in Luyang District. They highlight multiple aspects of **functional livability**, such as convenient transportation, good property management, commercial facilities, educational resources, and overall comfort. This indicates that the author associates **high-quality living conditions** with the desirability of a residential area and possibly its ""local"" value.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通方便，地铁方便"" (convenient transportation, convenient metro access)  
- ""有商场"" (has shopping malls)  
- ""小区环境好，物业好"" (good neighborhood environment and property management)  
- ""学区好"" (good school district)  
- ""周围设施也好"" (surrounding facilities are also good)  
- ""住了就不想走了"" (don’t want to move after living there)  
- ""第二套房子准备还买橡树湾或者附近"" (planning to buy a second home in Oaks Bay or nearby)

These all point to the **functional and environmental quality** of the area as key reasons for the author’s preference and long-term residential commitment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses descriptions of **functional convenience**, **environmental quality**, and **residential satisfaction** to express a strong endorsement of Oaks Bay as a **high-quality local living space**. This implies that such areas are seen as **ideal or superior ""local"" residential areas**, potentially distinguishing them from less desirable or inconvenient areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** and **uses** the **functional livability and environmental quality** of the area as a **key standard** for evaluating where to live and where to invest in property, which in turn reflects their perception of what constitutes a **desirable or ""true"" local area**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**, as the author evaluates and endorses the area based on its **amenities, convenience, and environmental quality**, and even plans to invest in a second home there — all indicating that these factors define what the author considers a **desirable local living space**.

这个不知道反正包河区公务员分数线最高，高的离谱,RL7,"  
The author is expressing that the civil service exam score cutoff in Baohe District is extremely high, implying that this district is more competitive or prestigious, possibly due to its administrative or socioeconomic status. Although the author does not directly define ""local people,"" they are highlighting a standard—civil service employment or competition for such positions—as a marker associated with the district.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""公务员分数线"" (civil service exam score cutoff) refers to a selection standard for becoming a civil servant.
- The mention of Baohe District being associated with high civil service competition implies that working in government or being employed in such roles may be symbolically linked to the area or its residents.
- The tone suggests that this district is seen as having a higher status or attracting more qualified candidates, which may indirectly reflect on the people living or working there.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author doesn't explicitly define ""local identity,"" the high civil service score cutoff is framed as a distinguishing feature of Baohe District. This could imply that civil service employment, a specific occupation, is associated with the area and potentially with a certain social or professional group that the author sees as representative of the district.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author indirectly links civil service employment (an occupation) to the character of the district and, by extension, to the identity of its residents. This aligns with using occupation as a symbolic marker of local identity or district character, even if it's not stated in explicit definitional terms.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL7 (Occupational Typification), as the author associates a specific professional group (civil servants) with a district, implying that this occupational identity plays a role in how the area or its residents are perceived or defined.

The author is evaluating different districts in Hefei (e.g., High-Tech, Binhu, Luyang, Shushan) based on multiple dimensions: industrial development, environmental comfort, and ""smoky atmosphere"" (i.e., local flavor or liveliness). They also explicitly mention using **administrative boundaries** as a way to define what constitutes the ""local"" area, with Shushan being highlighted as encompassing both old and new urban areas along with industry and environment.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""就产业而言，高新是大哥"" (High-Tech is the leader in terms of industry) → RL5 (Functional Livability, industrial function).  
- ""就环境而言，滨湖是最舒服的"" (Binhu is the most comfortable in terms of environment) → RL5.  
- ""就烟火气而言个人感官庐阳最有感觉"" (Luyang has the strongest sense of ""smoky atmosphere"") → potentially RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as this is a subjective but shared perception of the area’s character.  
- ""如果按行政区域来算，蜀山区无疑"" (If according to administrative boundaries, Shushan is undoubtedly the one) → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not only describing different areas’ qualities but also considering how these qualities affect perceptions of local identity or local value. Specifically:
- The **administrative boundary** is explicitly proposed as a standard for defining what counts as ""local,"" aligning with **RL2**.
- The descriptions of **industrial strength**, **environmental comfort**, and **local flavor** are used to evaluate the **hierarchy or desirability** of different local areas. This implies that the author believes certain areas are more representative of ""local"" identity based on these attributes, which fits **RL5**.
- The mention of ""烟火气"" (smoky atmosphere) can be interpreted as a **subjective but shared emotional or cultural perception** of what feels more authentically local, which can align with **RL1**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL2** is explicitly endorsed through the author’s statement that administrative boundaries are a valid standard for defining local identity.  
- **RL5** is endorsed through the author’s use of functional and environmental qualities to assess which areas are more representative or desirable as ""local.""  
- **RL1** is **not strongly endorsed** — while the ""烟火气"" of Luyang is mentioned, the author does not clearly imply that this is a standard for defining ""local"" identity, but rather a personal perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is clearly endorsed: the author explicitly uses administrative boundaries as a standard to judge which area is most representative of the city.  
- **RL5 (Functional Livability)** is also endorsed: the author evaluates areas based on their industrial, environmental, and cultural functions, and these evaluations are used to define which areas are more ""local"" or central in identity.

The author evaluates several districts in Hefei (e.g., Luyang, Shushan, Jingkai, Baohe, Yaohai, Binhu, Xinzhan) based on their **functional livability**—such as educational resources (学区), medical facilities (医院), transportation convenience (四通八达), and overall suitability for living. These are used to **rank or compare the quality of these areas as ""local"" living spaces**. The author implicitly defines what makes a district a desirable or ""genuine"" local area based on these criteria.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""消费反正是最高的"" (highest consumption level): indicates economic vibrancy and lifestyle quality.  
- ""有学区和医院"" (has school districts and hospitals): key indicators of livability.

- ""适合生活"" (suitable for living): overall evaluation of livability.  
- ""包河现在有点逐渐开始攀升的感觉"" (Baohe is gradually rising): suggests improvement in area quality or status.  
- ""瑶海环境不行，发展一般"" (Yaohai has poor environment and average development): evaluation of environmental and developmental quality.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **ranking and evaluating different districts** based on **livability-related attributes**—amenities, accessibility, and environment—and using these to **assess which areas are more or less desirable as ""local"" residential spaces**. This implies that **these factors influence the author’s perception of what constitutes a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area**, rather than just expressing general preferences.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **functional livability indicators** (amenities, environment, transportation, development trends) as **standards for evaluating the quality and desirability of ""local"" areas**, which directly informs their understanding of local identity or belonging in spatial terms.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)** category.

They also mention that despite being an old city area, Luyang District is **very convenient in terms of transportation and daily life**, and they have **""习惯了"" (gotten used to)** this lifestyle. This implies a strong identification with the area not only through birth and upbringing but also through **habitual living conditions**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长""** (born and raised here) — directly indicates family rootedness and long-term personal connection to the area.  
- **""庐阳区人""** (person of Luyang District) — reinforces the local identity tied to a specific place.  
- **""交通吃喝真的很方便""** (transportation and daily life are very convenient) — reflects functional livability.  
- **""习惯了""** (used to it) — indicates emotional and habitual attachment to the area's environment and lifestyle.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's identity as a **native of Luyang District** is central to their expression of local identity. While they do mention the **convenience and livability** of the area, these are framed as **reinforcements of their rootedness and comfort**, not as standalone criteria. The phrase **""土生土长""** is a strong indicator of **RL3**, and the overall tone suggests that their **identity is deeply shaped by growing up in the area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) indicates family rootedness and long-term local upbringing.  
- ""绿化好人少"" (good greenery, few people) refers to environmental and livability qualities.  
- ""买房首选"" (top choice for buying a house) shows a personal housing preference.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's identity as a native of the area is clearly rooted in their upbringing (RL3). However, the mention of preferring ""绿化好人少"" (good greenery, few people) is a personal preference for a comfortable living environment, not a standard used to define who is or isn't a local. There is no indication that the author believes only people living in such areas are ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does mention environmental quality and housing preferences, these are not used to define ""local identity"" but rather to express personal lifestyle preference. Therefore, these features should not be annotated under RL5. The only clearly endorsed and identity-defining criterion is the author's native/local upbringing, which fits RL3.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects the author's use of family rootedness and being born/raised locally to define their own ""local identity,"" aligning with RL3.

上派生活也超级方便，家家公园房，买菜也比市里的菜好，商业也很发达，现在还通地铁了,RL5,"  
The author is expressing a positive evaluation of the **livability and environmental quality** of Shangpai, emphasizing that daily life there is ""super convenient"" and that it offers advantages such as ""parkside housing,"" ""better vegetables,"" ""developed commercial facilities,"" and ""now has a subway."" This reflects a judgment that Shangpai is a high-quality place to live, potentially in comparison to the city center or other areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""超级方便"" (super convenient): functional convenience/livability.  
- ""家家公园房"" (every home is near a park): environmental quality.  
- ""买菜也比市里的菜好"" (buying vegetables is better than in the city): functional advantage.  
- ""商业也很发达"" (commercially developed): functional livability.  
- ""现在还通地铁了"" (now has a subway): transportation convenience, part of functional infrastructure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
All the mentioned features are used to **positively evaluate Shangpai as a desirable local residential area**. The author is not merely describing amenities but is **constructing an argument that Shangpai has the qualities that make a place ""genuinely local"" or at least a high-quality local living option**, implicitly contrasting it with the city or other areas that may lack these features.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that Shangpai has superior functional livability and environmental quality, and that this makes it a great place to live — **a standard used to judge or define the local value of an area**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, which involves evaluating areas based on material infrastructure and environmental quality, and **using these evaluations to define what kind of area is ""genuinely local"" or desirable in terms of local identity**.

The author initially had a negative view of the old urban area (""老城区"") due to its outdated appearance, but after living in the administrative district (""政务区"") for four years, they rediscovered the convenience and comfort of living in the old city. They emphasize how accessible medical services, food options, schools, and daily-life facilities are in the old city, which makes them love it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Functional convenience and livability features:**  
  - Medical resources: ""安医，中医院，省立随便选"" (choose freely among Anhui Medical University, TCM hospital, Provincial Hospital)  
  - Transportation convenience: ""电动车10分钟"" (10 minutes by electric scooter)  
  - Food and lifestyle: ""007，大老刘，各种美食街，小吃店"" (local food streets and snack shops)  
  - Education: ""送孩子上学10分钟内"" (10-minute commute to school)  
  - Daily-life facilities: ""周边都是菜场"" (surrounded by wet markets)  
- **Emotional shift and endorsement:** ""结果...真香"" (ended up loving it), ""爱死了"" (love it to death) indicate a strong positive evaluation of the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the **functional livability and environmental quality** of the old city—its accessibility, convenience, and richness of daily-life resources—as the core basis for their positive evaluation. This leads to an emotional shift from dislike to strong affection, and the author implicitly defines what makes a place ""genuinely local"" or desirable in terms of living experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the **functional convenience, environmental quality, and lifestyle accessibility** of the old city as key standards for evaluating its value as a ""local"" living space. These features are not just described as nice; they are used to **justify the author's shift in perception** and to **define what makes a place ""truly local"" in a desirable way**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**, as the author evaluates the old city based on its material infrastructure, accessibility, and lifestyle convenience, and uses these features to define its ""local"" value and express a strong emotional attachment to it.

只要上班通勤不堵车的，或是有地铁直达的，住哪里都好～因为各个区都有自己的商业圈，外卖也很方便。,RL5,"  
The author expresses a preference for residential locations that are convenient in terms of commute—either not prone to traffic congestion or accessible by subway. They also emphasize that all districts have their own commercial centers and convenient food delivery services, suggesting that functional accessibility and urban amenities are key to their evaluation of where to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只要上班通勤不堵车的，或是有地铁直达的"" (as long as the commute to work isn't congested or has a direct subway line) → reflects concerns with transportation convenience.  
- ""各个区都有自己的商业圈"" (every district has its own commercial circle) → reflects the availability of local amenities.  
- ""外卖也很方便"" (food delivery is also convenient) → reflects functional urban livability features.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses functional urban convenience (transportation, commercial facilities, food delivery) as a basis to argue that any area can be a good place to live, as long as it meets these livability standards. This implies that **they define a desirable or acceptable ""local"" living environment based on these functional and convenience-based criteria**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses these livability and functional convenience factors (transportation, commercial facilities, food delivery) as **standards for evaluating residential areas** and determining whether a place qualifies as a ""good"" or ""acceptable"" local living environment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates residential areas based on convenience, transportation, and urban amenities, and uses these criteria to determine what kind of area is suitable for ""local"" living.

瑶海排除，乱死了尤其龙岗这边长江批发市场这里，绿灯过斑马线一堆开电瓶车运货的一点也不看，就上来撞人,RL5,"  
The author expresses a strong negative evaluation of the瑶海 (Yaohai) area, especially 龙岗 (Longgang) and 长江批发市场 (Changjiang Wholesale Market), describing it as chaotic and unsafe. The criticism centers on traffic disorder and the behavior of people riding electric scooters for freight, which the author sees as emblematic of the area's undesirable qualities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""瑶海排除"" (Exclude Yaohai): This is a clear evaluative statement about the area.
- ""乱死了"" (Extremely chaotic): A strong negative evaluation of the area's environment.
- ""绿灯过斑马线一堆开电瓶车运货的"" (At the green light, a bunch of people on electric scooters carrying freight ignore pedestrians): Describes a chaotic and potentially dangerous traffic situation.
- The author implicitly contrasts this area with more orderly or desirable ""local"" areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing traffic conditions—they are using these observations to **evaluate the area negatively** and to **exclude it from their conception of a desirable or authentic local space**. The chaotic environment and the type of activity (freight delivery by electric scooters) are used to justify this exclusion. This implies a **hierarchy of local areas**, where Yaohai, especially Longgang and Changjiang Market, is seen as less ""local"" in a desirable or legitimate sense.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses** a standard that **uses environmental quality and functional livability** (or lack thereof) to **evaluate and exclude certain areas from being considered ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local areas**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, where the author evaluates the area not just for its inconvenience, but to **construct a standard of what constitutes a ""true"" or ""desirable"" local area** based on environmental safety, order, and livability.

Output: RL5"
其实我觉得合肥总体生活体验都挺好的反正哪里都交通便利,(no label),"  
The author expresses a general satisfaction with the quality of life in Hefei, particularly emphasizing ""交通便利"" (transportation convenience). However, they do not propose or endorse any specific standard for defining ""local people"" identity. The statement is more of an overall positive evaluation of the city's livability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通便利"" (convenient transportation) is mentioned as a positive aspect of life in Hefei.  
- No other identity markers (e.g., administrative belonging, family rootedness, linguistic traits, etc.) are discussed.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing a general opinion about the city’s functional livability but **does not link this to a standard for defining ""local people"" identity** or for distinguishing between locals and non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no indication that the author uses transportation convenience or any other feature to define who is or is not a ""local person."" The statement is a general positive remark about the city, not a definition of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use any criteria to define ""local people"" identity, **no RL category applies**.

作为土生土长本地人目前居住滨湖，但还是喜欢我庐阳啊,RL3,"  
The author identifies as a ""土生土长本地人"" (native local person) and currently lives in Binhu, but still expresses a strong emotional attachment to Luxiang. This indicates a deep-rooted emotional connection to their place of origin, beyond just current residence.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长本地人"" (native local person) explicitly indicates a self-identification based on being born and raised in the area.  
- ""目前居住滨湖"" (currently living in Binhu) shows current residence, but it's not used as the basis for identity.  
- ""但还是喜欢我庐阳"" (but still like my Luxiang) indicates emotional attachment and preference for the original area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key point is that the author defines their local identity based on being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here), not based on where they currently live. The emotional attachment to Luxiang reinforces this identity rooted in family history and early life experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and expresses the view that being born and raised in a place (family rootedness) is central to defining their local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, which emphasizes being ""土生土长"" as a core basis for local identity.

Output: RL3"
你看哪个区房价最贵。,RL6,"  
The author is prompting a comparison of housing prices across districts, implying that **high housing price is a marker of value or status** for a given area. Although the sentence is short and lacks explicit evaluative language, the implication is that **areas with higher housing prices are more desirable or prestigious**, which may reflect a standard for judging where ""real locals"" live or what constitutes a ""quality"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""房价最贵"" (most expensive housing price) points to economic value as a potential standard for evaluating area desirability or status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the sentence does not directly define ""local people,"" it implies that **housing price — and by extension, economic value or exclusivity — is a meaningful standard for evaluating urban space**. If the author is using this as a proxy for identifying which areas are considered ""core"" or ""desirable"" for local identity, then this could be linked to **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, where **financial ability to reside in certain areas** is used to define a hierarchy of local belonging or legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not explicitly define ""local identity,"" but by framing the question around **which district has the most expensive housing**, they **implicitly endorse housing price as a meaningful indicator of area status**, which may be used to distinguish ""genuine"" or ""privileged"" local areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, where **economic standing and property ownership in certain areas are used as indicators of local legitimacy or identity differentiation**.

Output: RL6"
现在房价都在涨,None,"  
The author states ""现在房价都在涨"" (""housing prices are rising everywhere""), which is a general observation about property market trends. There is no mention of how this affects or defines ""local identity,"" nor is there any indication that the author believes rising housing prices are a standard for judging who is ""local"" or what areas count as ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase refers to economic trends in the housing market.
- No specific areas, identities, or evaluative standards related to ""local identity"" are mentioned.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument being made about ""local identity"" or how people are categorized based on location, ancestry, language, or any other RL criteria. The statement is purely descriptive and does not express the author's standard or belief about who counts as ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the text does not present any criteria that the author uses or endorses to define ""local identity,"" none of the RL categories apply.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The statement does not engage with or endorse any standards for defining ""local identity."" Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

Output: None"
大部分是工业区。地铁覆盖范围少，公园也就两个,(no RL category applies),"  
The author is describing certain areas as primarily industrial, with limited metro coverage and few parks. This conveys a negative evaluation of the area’s livability and infrastructure. However, the author does **not** explicitly or implicitly link these characteristics to a **standard for defining who is or is not “local.”**

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “Industrial area” (工业区) — could relate to RL7 (Occupational Typification) if tied to a working-class identity or used to distinguish groups, but it is not clearly tied to identity here.  
- “Few metro lines” (地铁覆盖范围少) and “only two parks” (公园也就两个) — point to RL5 (Functional Livability), as they describe infrastructure and environmental quality.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is providing an **objective description** and **negative assessment** of the area’s infrastructure and amenities. However, there is **no indication** that the author uses these characteristics to define **local identity** or to judge who counts as “local.” The text lacks any evaluative or definitional language about “local people” or their legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL elements are used by the author to **define or evaluate local identity**. The text only discusses **environmental and infrastructural shortcomings**, not **standards for who is local**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text contains features related to RL5 and possibly RL7, the author does **not** use them to define or evaluate “local identity.” Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

Output: (no RL category applies)"
南站附近地铁公交都方便 比经开有的地方好多了,RL5,"  
The author is comparing the transportation convenience of two areas — emphasizing that the area near **Nanzhan (South Station)** has good metro and bus access, and is **better than some parts of Economic Development Zone (KaiFa)** in this regard. The statement focuses on **functional livability**, particularly **transportation convenience**, as a key quality of a local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""地铁公交都方便"" (convenient metro and bus) — relates to **transportation infrastructure**, a key aspect of **functional livability (RL5)**.
- ""比经开有的地方好多了"" (much better than some parts of KaiFa) — indicates **spatial comparison** based on **quality of urban function**, not just administrative boundary or cultural identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **evaluating the quality of a local area** based on **transportation and public transit convenience**, and **implicitly using this to judge which area is more desirable or ""better""**. This aligns with the RL5 logic of using **functional livability** to assess or define what constitutes a **desirable or ""true"" local area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the **transportation convenience** of Nanzhan as a **positive trait**, and **compares it favorably** to another area. This implies that **functional urban infrastructure** is an important standard in evaluating the **local quality or desirability** of an area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This statement fits **RL5: Functional Livability**, as it evaluates areas based on **transportation infrastructure and convenience**, and **uses that evaluation to define or compare the desirability of local areas**.

Output: RL5"
交通不便直接pass,N/A,"  
The author is expressing a dismissive attitude toward areas with inconvenient transportation, implying that such areas are not worth considering. However, the statement does not directly define or evaluate ""local identity"" or who counts as a ""local person."" It focuses on the quality of the environment or livability rather than criteria for belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通不便"" (inconvenient transportation) refers to functional livability.
- ""直接pass"" (directly pass over) suggests a personal preference or standard for choosing where to live or engage.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author is clearly using transportation convenience as a standard for evaluating places, there is **no explicit or implicit link** to defining ""local people"" or ""local identity."" The statement reflects a personal or general preference for convenient living conditions, not a standard for who is considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does not use the concept of transportation convenience to define or judge ""local identity"" or the status of being ""local,"" this does not meet the criteria for any RL category.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
No RL category applies because the author is not using the mentioned standard (transportation) to define or evaluate ""local identity.""

Output:"
骑小车坐公交还是地铁哪点不方便,(no label),"  
The rhetorical question ""骑小车坐公交还是地铁哪点不方便"" (If you ride a car, take a bus, or take the subway, where is inconvenient?) expresses the speaker's view that the area in question has well-developed transportation options, making it convenient to live there. The tone implies approval of the area's accessibility and livability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""骑小车坐公交还是地铁"" (riding a car, taking a bus, or taking the metro) refers to convenient transportation options.
- ""哪点不方便"" (where is inconvenient) evaluates the area positively in terms of functional convenience and livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the area's convenient transportation options to affirm its functional livability and imply that it is a desirable place to live. However, the statement does not explicitly or strongly suggest that this convenience is used as a standard to define ""local identity"" or determine who counts as ""local."" Instead, it reflects a general evaluation of the area's convenience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author appreciates the functional convenience of the area, there is **no explicit or strong implicit link** between this convenience and the definition of ""local identity."" The statement remains at the level of evaluating the area's livability, not using that evaluation to establish criteria for who is or is not considered ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not clearly endorse or imply that functional livability (RL5) is used to define ""local identity,"" it does not meet the criteria for annotation under the RL framework.

天天堵车，开车没地方停，没有快速路，红绿灯太多，住一下交通方便的地方就有对比,RL5,"  
The author is expressing frustration with traffic congestion, lack of parking, absence of expressways, and too many traffic lights. They contrast this with the idea that living in a place with better transportation convenience would make the difference clear — implying that areas with better traffic infrastructure are superior and more desirable for local living.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""天天堵车"" (traffic jams every day), ""开车没地方停"" (no parking), ""没有快速路"" (no expressway), ""红绿灯太多"" (too many traffic lights) — all describe poor traffic conditions.  
- ""住一下交通方便的地方就有对比"" (living in a place with convenient transportation makes the contrast clear) — directly links traffic convenience to quality of life and residential preference.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating the **livability** of different local areas based on transportation infrastructure and traffic efficiency. They imply that areas with better traffic conditions are more desirable and that this **functional convenience** is a standard for judging local living quality.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **transportation convenience and traffic infrastructure** as important standards for evaluating and choosing a ""better"" local living environment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author uses traffic and transportation conditions to evaluate and compare the desirability and quality of local areas, implying that areas with better traffic infrastructure are more ""livable"" and thus represent a higher standard of local life.

Output: RL5"
我也住城区，但是近综合交通，你自己试试下高架5分钟就到家多舒服了,RL5,"  
The author emphasizes the convenience of their residential location—specifically, its proximity to integrated transportation infrastructure (e.g., elevated roads). They highlight that getting home within five minutes after exiting the elevated road is a significant comfort, indicating that functional livability and transportation convenience are key factors in their evaluation of the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我也住城区"" (I also live in the urban area) – suggests a claim to being part of the urban ""local.""  
- ""近综合交通"" (close to integrated transportation) – emphasizes transportation convenience.  
- ""下高架5分钟就到家"" (five minutes home after getting off the elevated road) – a specific expression of functional accessibility.  
- ""多舒服了"" (how comfortable) – evaluative language linking livability and comfort to the area’s functional attributes.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses proximity to transportation infrastructure and ease of commuting as a way to affirm the desirability and livability of their residential area. This implies a standard for what constitutes a ""good"" or ""comfortable"" local living area, and by extension, what kind of area or resident counts as genuinely or desirably ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the value of transportation convenience and functional accessibility as important qualities of a desirable local residential area. This is not just a personal preference—it is framed as a standard for evaluating the quality of a ""local"" living environment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author uses the presence of convenient transportation and functional infrastructure to evaluate and implicitly define what constitutes a comfortable, desirable, or ""legitimate"" local area.

Output: RL5"
我说的近综合交通不就这样吗？,(none),"  
The sentence is incomplete and vague in context: ""我说的近综合交通不就这样吗？"" roughly translates to ""Isn't what I'm saying about integrated transportation exactly like that?"" The author appears to be making a rhetorical or confirmatory statement about transportation infrastructure, possibly in response to a previous comment or misunderstanding.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""综合交通"" (integrated transportation) may relate to functional livability (RL5) if the author is using transportation convenience as a standard to define or evaluate a local area.
- However, the sentence is too elliptical and lacks context to determine whether the author is using transportation as a **criterion for defining ""local identity""** or merely commenting on infrastructure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no clear argument or evaluative stance about ""local identity"" or who counts as ""local."" The sentence seems to be a passing remark rather than a statement that endorses or defines local belonging through any of the RL criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is insufficient evidence to determine that the author is using any specific RL criteria to define ""local people"" or evaluate local areas. No explicit or implicit endorsement of a standard for ""local identity"" is present.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Due to the lack of clarity, context, and a defined stance on local identity criteria, **no RL category can be confidently assigned**.

The author discusses the **convenience of location** in the Hua Fu Jun Yuan area, emphasizing its **central spatial position** relative to major commercial centers (Yintai, Xin Cheng, Wanxiang City), and evaluates it based on **functional livability**—specifically proximity and accessibility. They also mention a **limitation related to job availability**, but this is framed as a practical concern rather than a standard for defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Most convenient""**, **""distance... fairly balanced""** – functional spatial advantage, livability, convenience.
- **""Major commercial areas""**, **""Yintai, Xin Cheng, Wanxiang City""** – reference to core urban facilities that symbolize centrality and convenience.
- **""Few good jobs nearby""** – relates to economic opportunity but not framed as a boundary marker for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates the area based on **spatial convenience and access to urban amenities**, which implies a **preference for a centrally located, functionally livable area**. This aligns with a **functional understanding of urban space** and a **preference for areas with high livability**, but the author does **not** explicitly or implicitly link this to **who counts as a local person**—only to **where it's convenient to live**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the text discusses **functional livability**, it does **not** make the leap to **using that as a standard to define ""local people"" or to distinguish locals from non-locals**. The author is evaluating **residential quality**, not **identity boundaries**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although RL5 (Functional Livability) is discussed, it is **not used by the author to define or judge ""local identity""**, only to evaluate **residential convenience**. Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

The author expresses frustration with traffic congestion in the old urban area (""老城区""), emphasizing that having a car reveals how severe the traffic jams are, lasting for hours. This reflects a critique of the old城区's traffic conditions, but **does not** indicate that the author uses this as a standard to define ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老城区"" (old urban area): a geographical reference.  
- ""堵车几小时的堵"" (traffic jams lasting hours): a description of traffic inconvenience.  
- ""有车之后你就知道"" (you know after you have a car): suggests a personal experience of traffic conditions.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing the poor traffic conditions in the old城区, likely to express dissatisfaction or to explain the challenges of urban life. However, **there is no indication** that the author believes traffic congestion or car ownership is a criterion for judging who is ""local"" or what counts as a ""local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the described elements are used by the author to define ""local identity."" The text does not propose or imply that traffic conditions, place of residence, or car ownership are standards for determining who counts as local.

还有双地铁4.6也是很方便，就是新房二手一起疯狂卷，还有五里庙和朗溪路高架不利因素美中不足,RL5,"  
The author is describing a local area's living conditions, emphasizing that it has convenient transportation (""双地铁4.6号线"") and pointing out that the coexistence of new and second-hand housing has led to intense competition (""疯狂卷""). They also note that the presence of Wulimiao and Langxi Road overpasses is a ""不利因素美中不足"" — a negative factor that detracts from the area's overall appeal.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""双地铁4.6号线"" (Lines 4 and 6 double subway access) indicates functional transportation convenience.
- ""新房二手一起疯狂卷"" (new and second-hand housing in fierce competition) suggests a high level of housing market activity and possibly density or price pressures.
- ""五里庙和朗溪路高架"" (Wulimiao and Langxi Road overpasses) are cited as negative environmental factors, possibly related to noise, pollution, or aesthetics.
- The overall tone evaluates the area’s livability and desirability, weighing both pros and cons.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is assessing the area’s quality as a place to live, using transportation access and housing market dynamics as positive indicators, and infrastructure (overpasses) as a negative factor. This implies a standard for what constitutes a desirable or undesirable ""local"" area — a core concern in defining local identity through environmental and functional quality.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author does not explicitly say ""only people living in areas with good transportation are real locals,"" they do imply that transportation convenience contributes to the area's desirability, and that infrastructure drawbacks reduce its local appeal. This evaluative stance is directly tied to the author’s perception of what makes a place a ""good"" or ""desirable"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the area based on transportation, housing market dynamics, and environmental quality — and uses these to judge the area's desirability as a local living space.

肥东必须是最差，工业园不说了，空气环境不行，交通也不行，设施也跟不上 ， 下雨就涝，地震中心,RL5,"  
The author is strongly criticizing the living conditions in Feidong, listing multiple negative aspects such as poor air quality, inconvenient transportation, inadequate facilities, frequent flooding, and even being a seismic zone. This implies that Feidong lacks the basic conditions for being a desirable or ""genuine"" local living area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Air environment不行 (not good)"" → environmental quality  
- ""交通也不行 (transportation is inconvenient)"" → transportation convenience  
- ""设施也跟不上 (facilities can't keep up)"" → infrastructure and amenities  
- ""下雨就涝 (floods when it rains)"" → environmental vulnerability  
- ""地震中心 (seismic zone)"" → safety and environmental stability  
These all point to functional livability and environmental quality as key concerns.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing poor conditions—they are **evaluating Feidong as an undesirable place to live**, and by implication, **not a place that meets the standard of a ""genuine"" or acceptable local area**. The tone and logic suggest that these deficiencies disqualify Feidong from being considered a ""true"" or ""quality"" part of the local space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses the idea that a desirable local area should have good environmental quality, infrastructure, and livability**, and **Feidong fails to meet these standards**, thus it is seen as inferior or not truly part of the ""local"" core.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, where the author uses environmental and infrastructural quality as **standards to evaluate and implicitly define what constitutes a desirable or legitimate ""local"" area**, and by contrast, what does not.

瑶海有烟火气而且瑶海设施陪套齐全，生活消费低，并且瑶海交通方便,RL5,"  
The author praises瑶海 (Yaohai) for its ""smoky atmosphere"" (indicating a vibrant, everyday life), complete facilities, low cost of living, and convenient transportation. These are all descriptions of the area's **livability and functional convenience**. The author is expressing that Yaohai is a comfortable and practical place to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""烟火气"" (smoky atmosphere) implies a lively, everyday urban life.  
- ""设施配套齐全"" (complete facilities) refers to infrastructure and public services.  
- ""生活消费低"" (low living costs) relates to economic accessibility.  
- ""交通方便"" (convenient transportation) emphasizes mobility and connectivity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
All of these descriptions serve to **positively evaluate Yaohai as a desirable local area**, based on its functional and livability characteristics. The author implies that these features make Yaohai a high-quality or authentic ""local"" area to live in, compared to other areas that may lack these traits.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses and uses** the area’s functional livability — including convenience, affordability, and transportation — as a standard for judging it as a desirable or ""real"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, where the author evaluates an area based on its material infrastructure and quality of life, and uses that to define what constitutes a desirable or authentic ""local"" area.

Output: RL5"
瑶海区还行吧，尤其是一环二环那里，我家门口有三号线地铁和能直通市中心的公交车，区内有38中这样的好初中,RL5,"  
The author is expressing a positive evaluation of the Yaohai District, especially areas within the First and Second Ring Roads. They highlight convenient transportation (Subway Line 3 and buses to the city center) and quality educational resources (No. 38 Middle School) as key reasons for this positive view. These features are used to argue that the area is a desirable and functional place to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一环二环"" (First and Second Ring Roads): Refers to a specific geographic zone, indicating a spatial认知 (spatial认知 is part of RL1).
- ""地铁三号线"" (Subway Line 3), ""直通市中心的公交车"" (buses directly to the city center): Functional transportation access, part of livability.
- ""区内有38中这样的好初中"" (a good middle school in the district): Educational resources, part of quality of life and infrastructure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not defining local identity purely through administrative boundaries or generational roots, but rather by emphasizing the **functional advantages** of living in this area — particularly transportation convenience and access to quality schools. These are used to imply that Yaohai, especially near the ring roads, is a **desirable and legitimate ""local"" area** to live in, thus contributing to the author’s perception of its local value.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses **livability features** — transportation and education — as standards to evaluate and affirm the local quality of the area. This goes beyond mere preference and is used to define what constitutes a good or legitimate ""local"" residential area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author uses infrastructure and quality-of-life features to evaluate and define what makes a place a desirable or legitimate part of the ""local"" urban fabric.

Output: RL5"
交通确实很方便的,(none),"  
The author mentions that ""transportation is indeed very convenient,"" which is a general statement about functional livability. However, there is **no explicit or implicit link** to how this convenience defines ""local identity"" or distinguishes ""local people"" from others.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通确实很方便的"" (Transportation is indeed very convenient) relates to functional livability (RL5), but it is a standalone statement.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument or evaluation** about who is or isn't a local, nor is there any boundary-drawing, identity classification, or standard-setting related to transportation convenience. The statement is descriptive, not evaluative or definitional in terms of ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does **not use transportation convenience** to define or evaluate ""local people"" or ""local areas,"" this does **not** meet the criteria for RL5 or any other RL category.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text does not provide sufficient evidence of any endorsed standard for defining ""local identity."" Therefore, **no RL label should be assigned**.

Output: (none)"
是真的很方便 就是房价贵了噻，改善也没有选择,RL5,"  
The author expresses that although the location is ""really convenient"" (likely referring to functional livability such as proximity to services, transportation, etc.), the high housing prices make it difficult to improve their living situation, implying that there is no better alternative within their economic reach.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""很方便"" (very convenient) suggests functional convenience and livability of the area.  
- ""房价贵"" (expensive housing prices) and ""改善也没有选择"" (no choice for improvement) indicate economic constraints and the lack of accessible alternatives, implying a standard of residential choice based on affordability and area quality.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author links the area’s convenience with its high cost, suggesting that while the area is desirable (and possibly seen as a ""true"" or ""preferred"" local area due to its livability), it is also exclusive. This implies that such areas may be considered more ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local spaces, but are out of reach for many due to economic barriers.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that the area is functionally convenient (RL5) and implicitly frames this convenience as a key factor shaping residential identity and desirability. Although the author does not explicitly define ""local people"" based on this, they imply that the area’s livability makes it a preferred local space, even if not everyone can afford to live there.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with RL5 because the author evaluates the area based on its functional livability (convenience), and implicitly links this to its status as a desirable local residential space, even though economic barriers limit access.

Output: RL5"
我也喜欢七里塘，摆摊吃 真的很方便，去步行街也很方便，离省医院也不远，也不用下班开车去挤那边,RL5,"  
The author expresses a preference for the Qilitang area, emphasizing its convenience in daily life — such as street food, proximity to the pedestrian street, and the provincial hospital — and mentions that it avoids the hassle of traffic congestion after work. This indicates that the author values the area based on its **functional convenience and livability**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""摆摊吃 really convenient"" (street food is convenient) → **daily life convenience**  
- ""去步行街也很方便"" (convenient to the pedestrian street) → **accessibility**  
- ""离省医院也不远"" (not far from the provincial hospital) → **amenities and services**  
- ""不用下班开车去挤那边"" (no need to drive through traffic after work) → **livability and traffic convenience**

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements collectively support the author's **positive evaluation of Qilitang as a desirable local living area**, based on its functional convenience and quality of life. The author implies that such features make it a **""better"" or more livable local area**, which indirectly informs their standard for what constitutes a **comfortable and therefore valuable ""local"" environment**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **functional convenience and environmental quality** (e.g., food, traffic, healthcare, accessibility) define a desirable or ideal local living area. This fits the **RL5** framework, as the author uses these features to **evaluate the livability and local value** of the area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author uses **convenience of daily life, access to amenities, and traffic/environmental comfort** to assess and affirm the **quality and desirability of a local area**, thereby defining what makes a place a **""good"" or ""comfortable"" local space**.

Output: RL5"
有一系列的配套，离老城区也很近，就很方便,RL5,"  
The author emphasizes the convenience and completeness of living facilities (""有一系列的配套"") and the proximity to the old urban area (""离老城区也很近""), highlighting the functional convenience and environmental quality of the location. This reflects a standard for evaluating the desirability and ""local value"" of a residential area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有一系列的配套"" (a full range of配套设施): indicates the completeness of functional amenities.  
- ""离老城区也很近"" (very close to the old urban area): reflects spatial convenience and connection to the city center.  
- ""就很方便"" (very convenient): expresses a positive evaluation of the area’s livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements are used to evaluate the area's quality of life and spatial advantage, implying that such characteristics make it a desirable or ""genuine"" local living space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses the presence of facilities and convenient location as standards for evaluating the quality of a local area and its desirability as a place to live, which is closely related to the definition of ""local identity"" in terms of where ""true locals"" would live.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author evaluates the area based on its material infrastructure and convenience, and implicitly uses these as criteria for what constitutes a high-quality or desirable ""local"" living space.

 欢迎理性讨论，拒绝无脑发言。该区域划分按照济南现有发展程度所制，无任何地域歧视",RL1,"  
The author presents a personal but reasoned view of the current spatial boundaries of Jinan’s urban core area. They define these boundaries using major roads and elevated highways, and emphasize that the division is based on the city's actual development level, not on any form of regional bias. The author implicitly endorses a shared or conventional understanding of which areas ""count"" as the real or core urban area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Clear spatial boundary definitions (east, west, south, north lines using road names) indicate a habitual or conventional spatial cognition.
- The author distinguishes between ""core"" and ""non-core"" areas based on development level, suggesting an implicit emotional or symbolic map of the city.
- The statement ""no regional discrimination"" implies awareness of how such boundary definitions can be used to exclude or marginalize, but the author insists their view is objective.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a cognitive map of the city based on shared development patterns and spatial perception. They are not using administrative boundaries, family history, or economic status, but rather a socially understood or commonly accepted perception of where the ""real"" city lies.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a conventional or habitual understanding of the city's spatial identity — that is, which areas are seen as the ""real"" city and which are not — based on shared perceptions of development and centrality.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority. The author defines the boundaries of ""local"" identity not through official administrative divisions, but through a shared perception of where the city center is based on development and infrastructure, implying a socially accepted emotional or symbolic map of the city.

我小时候从济钢到市区叫做“去济南”。……而且还要坐火车去“济南”，那时济钢桥头有个374车站，编号是距离青岛站374公里的意思，后面改叫韩仓站，现在废弃了。后来有了8路、10路公交车……现在公交、地铁一应俱全，不过不超过CBD（原二钢）还是电瓶车最方便,RL1,"  
The author reflects on their personal experiences growing up in a specific area (Ji Gang), describing how the act of traveling from Ji Gang to the urban core was once referred to as “going to Jinan,” implying a historical perception of spatial separation. They also mention the evolution of transportation infrastructure — from trains to buses to subways — emphasizing how these changes have influenced their understanding of spatial relationships and accessibility. The author still prefers the e-bike within certain areas due to convenience, highlighting how mobility shapes their perception of spatial function and integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “From Ji Gang to the市区 (urban area) called ‘去济南 (going to Jinan)’” indicates a historical perception of spatial separation and identity boundary.
- “Ji Gang bridgehead 374 station” and the naming logic based on distance from Qingdao Station reflects a historical spatial认知 framework.
- “Later had 8路, 10路 buses… now public transport and subway are all available” shows changes in functional accessibility.
- “Still, within the CBD (former Second Steel Plant), e-bikes are the most convenient” implies a functional evaluation of urban space based on livability and convenience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's narrative centers on how spatial identity and belonging have evolved over time. Initially, Ji Gang was perceived as separate from the urban core, requiring a symbolic journey (“going to Jinan”). Over time, with improved transportation infrastructure, this spatial separation has diminished. The author implicitly endorses a **socially habitual understanding of space** — one that has evolved but still carries symbolic weight. While infrastructure improvements (RL5) are mentioned, they are not used by the author as the **standard for defining local identity**, but rather as background context for how spatial perception has changed.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **certain areas were historically not considered part of the urban core** and that this **spatial perception was shared and habitual** — a symbolic boundary that shaped local identity. This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a **socially shared, historically sedimented perception of spatial categories** used to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s description of how Ji Gang was once perceived as “not Jinan” and required a symbolic journey to reach the city core reflects a **socially habitual spatial cognition**. This perception, though changing due to infrastructure, was once a defining feature of local identity and still carries symbolic meaning. Therefore, the text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

Output: RL1"
我小时候以前从章丘到济南还有收费站,N/A,"  
The author mentions a past experience — that there used to be a toll station when traveling from Zhangqiu to Jinan during their childhood. This is a neutral observation about historical transportation infrastructure, likely used to illustrate a sense of past spatial separation or administrative boundary.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""From Zhangqiu to Jinan"" indicates two geographically distinct areas.
- ""There were toll stations"" implies a former boundary or administrative distinction between regions.
- ""When I was a child"" situates this in the past, suggesting a change over time.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The toll station is mentioned as a historical marker of separation or boundary, but the author does not express a view on who is or isn't a ""local person"" based on this. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of a standard for defining local identity — only a recollection of past spatial or administrative distinctions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is **no endorsement** of a standard for defining ""local identity."" The toll station is not used to judge or define who is ""local"" or what area counts as ""local."" The author simply recalls a past condition without linking it to identity or belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use the information to define or evaluate ""local identity,"" **no RL category applies**.

Output:"
坐标槐荫……86年……小时候我们在机务段做火车去市里……,RL3,"  
The author is reminiscing about their childhood experiences, mentioning specific locations (""槐荫,"" likely a place name or district) and a year (""86年"" – 1986), along with memories of taking a train from the locomotive segment to the city center. This suggests a personal connection and rootedness in the area through lived experience and time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""坐标槐荫"" (Coordinates: Huaiyin) – refers to a specific place, indicating a sense of rootedness or identification with that location.  
- ""86年"" (1986) – indicates a long-standing personal timeline, suggesting the author has lived in the area for a significant amount of time.  
- ""小时候我们在机务段做火车去市里"" (When we were little, we took trains from the locomotive segment to the city center) – implies a personal growth history tied to the area and its infrastructure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is sharing personal memories and a long-term attachment to a specific place (""槐荫""), suggesting a deep-rooted connection to the area through time and lived experience. This implies that the author sees their identity as being shaped by growing up in that specific location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being from a place involves having grown up there and having long-term familiarity with it — a sense of being ""土生土长"" (born and raised there), which is central to defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a definition of local identity based on being born and raised in a specific place and having a long-term personal history there, which aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

The author is comparing the development and perception of two cities — Jinan and Qingdao. They acknowledge Jinan as a historical and cultural city, with current strong districts like Lixia and Shizhong, benefiting from resource allocation. However, the author also notes that many people (especially young people they interact with) evaluate urban value primarily based on development — and there is a shared belief that Qingdao is currently more developed or has better development potential. The author also sees Qingdao’s new infrastructure (e.g., subways) as a sign of future opportunity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Historical and cultural identity (""历史文化名城"")** – suggests cultural legitimacy.
- **""历下市中发展比较好，资源倾斜"" (""Lixia and Shizhong are developing well, with resource allocation"")** – implies functional livability and possibly administrative legitimacy.
- **""按发展谈论市区"" (""discuss districts in terms of development"")** – reflects a standard of development as a marker for urban or local value.
- **""青岛发展会比济南好"" (""Qingdao will develop better than Jinan"")** – reflects developmental comparison as a way to judge urban status.
- **""新建地铁...新机遇"" (""newly built subways...new opportunities"")** – functional livability and infrastructure as a sign of future livability and local value.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not defining ""local people"" by birthplace, accent, or administrative boundary, but rather through **urban development and infrastructure** — such as resource allocation, new metro lines, and overall economic and infrastructural growth. The author implies that people (especially young people) use these criteria to judge which city or district is more ""local"" in terms of modern urban life and opportunity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author clearly endorses **urban development and infrastructure** (e.g., metro construction, resource distribution, and economic growth) as important criteria for evaluating urban areas and implicitly for defining which areas or cities are seen as more ""genuinely local"" or desirable within the urban hierarchy.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The author is using **functional livability (RL5)** — particularly **development level, infrastructure, and resource distribution** — as the standard for evaluating urban areas and, by implication, local identity. While other categories (like administrative legitimacy or cultural history) are mentioned, they are not used as the **primary standard** for defining ""local"" in this context.

The author is sharing a personal narrative about how their perception of ""downtown Jinan"" or ""the city"" (市里) has been shaped by **habitual, socially shared spatial cognition** rooted in childhood experiences. Even though they now live in a different area (奥体附近), they still refer to going to 泉城路 as ""going into the city,"" reflecting a **deeply internalized emotional and symbolic map** of where the ""core"" of the city lies.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Childhood residence near 大明湖, a historically significant and central area in Jinan.  
- Boundaries defined by familiar landmarks (和谐, 甸柳庄, 洛口, 东八里洼), indicating a **socially habitual spatial understanding** of the city.  
- Referring to 章丘 as ""outside the city"" (with dirt roads), and still calling 泉城路 ""the city"" after living elsewhere for over a decade.  
- Long-term residence in a new area (奥体附近) does not change the symbolic meaning of what ""the city"" means emotionally or cognitively.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing where they lived or how the city has expanded administratively. Instead, they are expressing a **persistent, socially shared, and emotionally rooted spatial identity**—a sense of which areas are ""central"" or ""the real city"" and which are peripheral, based on **habitual and historical perception**, not administrative or functional criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a **socially habitual and emotionally rooted spatial cognition**—that certain areas symbolically represent the city, and others are still seen as outside, even after long-term residence elsewhere. This is a **core logic used to define what counts as 'local' or 'the city'** in terms of identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is using **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perceptions of spatial boundaries** to define what counts as ""the city"" and, by extension, who counts as ""local"" or where the ""real"" local area is.

The author identifies themselves as someone born in 2006 (""我06的"") and from **Shizhong District** (""家在市中区""). They also mention that when going to **Quancheng Road**, they still habitually refer to it as going to ""the city center"" (""市里""). This reflects a habitual, shared spatial perception of where the ""real city"" or ""core local area"" is, rooted in local linguistic and spatial cognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""家在市中区"" (live in Shizhong District): indicates a specific place of residence.  
- ""泉城路"" (Quancheng Road): a specific location within the city.  
- ""还习惯说是去市里"" (still habitually say going to the city center): reflects a **socially ingrained perception** of certain areas as representing the ""core"" of the city, even if administratively or geographically they may not be the only central areas.  
- The use of ""市里"" (the city center) implies a **symbolic spatial hierarchy**, where some areas are more ""central"" or ""authentically local"" than others.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's habitual use of ""市里"" (the city center) reflects a **socially shared, historically sedimented understanding** of which parts of the city are considered the symbolic or habitual core. This supports a **vernacular spatial authority** — a non-administrative, culturally embedded sense of where the ""real"" local center is located.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly affirms the **habitual, culturally shared perception** of certain areas as ""the city center,"" even if they are now living in another part of the city. This is not administrative or functional, but symbolic and habitual.

The author emphasizes that their statement has ""nothing to do with the old urban area at all,"" suggesting a clear boundary in their mind between what is considered ""old市区"" (urban core) and what is not. This reflects a symbolic spatial boundary in their perception of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""跟老市区没有一点关系"" (has nothing to do with the old urban area) indicates a strong perception of spatial identity and boundary.
- The year ""2022年"" provides context that this boundary perception persists in contemporary discourse.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a symbolic boundary between ""the old urban area"" and other areas, suggesting that certain identities or discussions only apply to the old市区, and that other areas should not be conflated with it. This reflects a habitual or socially sedimented understanding of spatial categories.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a socially shared perception of what areas ""count"" as the local core (老市区), and by exclusion, what does not. This is a form of vernacular spatial authority.

The author is making a point about how some ""老济南人"" (native or long-term residents of Jinan) do not necessarily identify with or remain in the traditional core areas like **Tianqiao and Huaiyin**, where they may have spent their childhood. Instead, when they have the financial means, they move to newer, more desirable areas like **Lingxiucheng**. The author implies that this migration pattern—**growing up in the old core but moving outward when possible**—is emblematic of what it means to be a ""老济南人"" in contemporary terms.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""老济南人""** – reference to local identity  
- **""天桥槐荫那块小时候呆了20年""** – long-term upbringing in a traditional part of the city (RL3: Family Rootedness)  
- **""等有钱买房了第一时间搬到领秀城附近""** – when financially able, moved to a new area (RL6: Social Embeddedness – financial ability and housing choice as a marker of local identity)  
- **""这才是老济南的缩影""** – implies a new standard or evolving understanding of what defines a ""老济南人""  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **redefining or updating** the notion of ""老济南人."" It's not just about staying in the old area, but rather about having **originally grown up in the traditional core**, and then **moving out when one achieves a certain economic status**. This implies that both **family rootedness (RL3)** and **economic status/social rootedness in a new kind of local space (RL6)** are used by the author to define who counts as a ""real"" or typical local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses this dual standard:  
- Having a **deep personal history** in the traditional local area (childhood in Tianqiao-Huaiyin)

洪楼很方便，可以坐地铁，推荐华山湖公园，环联夜市，洪楼教堂，省美术馆博物馆啥的都可以去看看,N/A,"  
The author is highlighting the convenience and attractiveness of the Honglou area, emphasizing its accessibility (e.g., ""can take the subway"") and the availability of amenities and recreational spots (e.g., parks, night markets, cultural institutions). The tone is positive and recommendatory, suggesting that Honglou is a desirable place to live or visit.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Convenient"" (implicitly conveyed through ""can take the subway"")  
- ""Honglou"" is described as a place with rich amenities and cultural resources  
- Mention of specific facilities like parks, museums, and night markets reflects functional livability  
- The author is not explicitly defining ""local people,"" but is describing the area’s attractiveness in terms of lifestyle and convenience

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is promoting the area based on its convenience, accessibility, and recreational/cultural offerings. While this implies that Honglou is a high-quality local area, the text does **not** explicitly or strongly imply that these features are used as **criteria to define who is or isn’t a local person**. The focus is on describing the area’s livability, not on identity boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text describes RL5-type features (functional livability), it does **not** present them as criteria for defining ""local identity."" The author is not making an argument about who counts as a local based on where they live or what amenities they have access to.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not using any of the RL criteria to define or evaluate ""local identity,"" **no RL category applies** in this case.

The author discusses the evolving perception of what constitutes the core area of Jinan (""老济南"") and contrasts it with the modern, expanded administrative and spatial reality of the city. They mention the traditional view that ""老济南"" is only the area within the moat, which reflects a habitual or socially shared perception of local spatial identity. At the same time, they acknowledge the administrative expansion of Jinan, including the incorporation of areas like Laiwu and Zhangqiu, suggesting that this expansion is justified and necessary for development as a provincial capital.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老济南只有护城河里面那一块"" — this reflects a socially habitual or traditional spatial understanding of the core local area.  
- ""老济南画个小圈圈"" — reinforces the idea of a small, traditionally recognized local core area.  
- ""莱芜章丘也并入济南了吧"" — refers to administrative expansion and incorporation, implying legitimacy through administrative change.  
- ""毕竟是省会，不发展一下如何是好"" — justifies expansion and development, but this is more of a rationale for growth than a direct standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author contrasts two perspectives:  
- A traditional, **socially habitual spatial understanding** (RL1) of ""老济南"" as only the inner moat area.  
- A **modern administrative perspective** (RL2) recognizing the expansion of Jinan to include areas like Laiwu and Zhangqiu.  
Both perspectives are acknowledged by the author without explicit rejection, suggesting that they are both relevant in defining or understanding ""local"" identity in Jinan — one from a historical/social spatial cognition, the other from an administrative standpoint.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts both:
- The traditional, socially shared understanding of a ""local"" core area (RL1).
- The administrative expansion as a legitimate basis for defining the new scope of Jinan and hence, potentially, who counts as ""local"" (RL2).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **both** a traditional vernacular spatial understanding of local identity (RL1) and an acknowledgment of administrative legitimacy in defining the evolving scope of the city and its people (RL2).

The author presents a layered understanding of how ""local"" identity and spatial perception evolve across generations. The grandfather defines the core of Jinan as within the moat, the aunt treats Quanfu as ""outside the city,"" the author (a post-80s person) feels the urban area is still within the Second Ring Road, and although the eastern part is developing rapidly, it still feels like ""outside the Second Ring Road."" This reflects a **habitual, socially shared spatial cognition** of what counts as the ""local core"" versus the periphery.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""护城河以里是济南"" (Inside the moat is Jinan) — habitual boundary cognition.
- ""闺女嫁外头去了"" (Marrying outside) — implies symbolic boundary of local belonging.
- ""市区还是二环里"" (Urban area is still within the Second Ring Road) — generational perception of core area.
- ""东部发展的比其他地方都快"" (Eastern part is developing faster) — acknowledges functional change but not symbolic shift.
- ""内心还是觉得那是『二环外』"" (Still feel it's 'outside the Second Ring Road') — persistent emotional/spatial boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing administrative boundaries, family history, or economic development, but rather how there is a **persistent, socially shared, and historically sedimented perception of spatial boundaries** that define what is considered the ""real"" or ""core"" local area. Even though the eastern part is more developed, it still feels ""outside"" — showing that **emotional and habitual spatial cognition**, not just function or administration, defines local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and reflects a **socially habitual and historically rooted spatial cognition** as the standard for defining what is ""truly"" local, and uses this to distinguish between core and peripheral areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author describes a **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perception of spatial boundaries** used to define local identity and distinguish insiders from outsiders, regardless of administrative or functional changes.

批发市场不是市区吗？？你家的批发市场在农村啊？？,RL1,"  
The author is challenging the idea that a wholesale market is not part of the urban area, implying that such areas should be considered part of the city. The rhetorical tone suggests the author rejects a spatial hierarchy that demotes certain areas (e.g., those with wholesale markets) to ""rural"" or non-urban status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""批发市场"" (wholesale market) is used as a reference point for spatial identity.
- The author questions whether such areas are considered ""市区"" (urban area) or ""农村"" (rural), indicating a debate over spatial categorization.
- The rhetorical questioning implies the author opposes a symbolic or habitual spatial ranking that excludes certain areas from being seen as ""市区.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending the urban identity of certain areas (those with wholesale markets) against a perceived social habit of spatial demotion. The argument is about how certain areas are symbolically categorized in local identity discourse.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly opposes a habitual or symbolic spatial categorization that excludes certain areas (e to rural status. By doing so, the author is advocating for a more inclusive definition of what ""counts"" as urban or local, based on shared, habitual spatial perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author’s engagement with **socially habitual or symbolic spatial categorizations**—specifically, the idea that certain areas (e.g., those with wholesale markets) are or should be considered part of the urban core in terms of local identity. This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

章丘人，上了大学说自己是济南的，别的区的觉得我碰瓷。。。。。说的和我们很想并入你们一样章丘市不比区大气啊？,RL1,"  
The author is expressing frustration over how people from other districts of Jinan react negatively when someone from Zhangqiu claims to be ""Jinan""—the reaction is described as if the Zhangqiu person is ""碰瓷"" (lit. ""porcelain bumping,"" i.e., falsely claiming association to gain status or legitimacy). The author defends Zhangqiu’s legitimacy and even prestige by noting that Zhangqiu was historically a **city (市)** rather than just a district (区), suggesting that this historical and symbolic status should grant them equal or greater standing in the broader ""Jinan"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The act of claiming ""I am Jinan"" reflects a tension over **who counts as local**.  
- The mention of **Zhangqiu being a former city (市)** rather than just a district (区)** implies a symbolic or historical rootedness and self-perception of superiority.  
- The **negative reaction from other districts** suggests a gatekeeping behavior based on perceived legitimacy of belonging.  
- The rhetorical question **""Zhangqiu isn’t less dignified than a district, is it?""** implies a **cognitive or symbolic hierarchy** of places within the city structure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is arguing that Zhangqiu people should be accepted as ""Jinan people"" based on **historical and symbolic legitimacy**, not just administrative status. The author resists the idea that only certain areas are truly ""local"" and pushes back on a hierarchy of local belonging that excludes Zhangqiu. However, the author **does not explicitly endorse** administrative legitimacy (RL2) alone; rather, they appeal to **a broader, shared historical and symbolic understanding** of what counts as ""local"" in the Jinan context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** administrative legitimacy alone as a standard (RL2), because they are pushing back on the idea that only certain areas are truly “Jinan.”  
- The author **does not endorse** linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7), as these are not mentioned.  
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** family rootedness (RL3), although the historical reference to Zhangqiu as a city might imply it.  
- The key focus is on **how areas are socially and historically perceived**—Zhangqiu being a city (市), not just a district, and being excluded from the local identity despite this.  
- This reflects a **shared perception of intra-city spatial categories** and **symbolic meaning of place**, which are used to define or dispute local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author is challenging the **socially accepted views** about which areas ""count"" as part of the local identity. The author argues that Zhangqiu, despite being a historically significant city, is symbolically excluded from the broader ""Jinan"" identity by other districts, and this exclusion is based on **shared, habitual perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**, not just administrative facts.

呃，有没有想过被划进来的也不喜欢济南啊，纯纯被济南吸血光靠济南市区早就让烟台超了,"(No RL category is endorsed by the author; the text critiques rather than endorses the use of administrative boundaries to define local identity.)

Output:","  
The author is expressing dissatisfaction with the administrative incorporation of certain areas into Jinan (the provincial capital), suggesting that these areas do not identify with or benefit from being part of Jinan. The author implies that Jinan's central district has exerted a form of dominance or ""siphoning"" effect, and that other cities like Yantai are surpassing Jinan economically. This reflects a critique of how administrative legitimacy can conflict with local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""被划进来的"" (those incorporated in) refers to areas administratively included within Jinan.
- ""也不喜欢济南"" (don't like Jinan) indicates a lack of认同 (identification) with the city despite administrative inclusion.
- ""被济南吸血"" (siphoned by Jinan) implies economic exploitation or inequality based on administrative hierarchy.
- ""让烟台超了"" (surpassed by Yantai) compares development outcomes, suggesting that administrative legitimacy does not equate to local desirability or success.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author critiques the mismatch between administrative boundaries and local identity. They argue that administrative incorporation into Jinan does not equate to local belonging or benefit, and in fact may be detrimental. This challenges the idea that administrative legitimacy (RL2) is a sufficient or even appropriate criterion for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly rejects the administrative legitimacy framework (RL2), highlighting that being ""划进来"" (incorporated) does not mean people feel they belong to Jinan. Instead, the author suggests that local identity is not defined by administrative boundaries but by lived experience and economic perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **resistance to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** as a defining standard for local identity. The author does not endorse administrative boundaries as a valid marker of ""localness"" and instead highlights the dissonance between administrative inclusion and local identification.

Output: (No RL category is endorsed by the author; the text critiques rather than endorses the use of administrative boundaries to define local identity.)

This reflects a **socially shared cognitive map** that distinguishes between urban and rural, core and peripheral, based on **habitual, symbolic spatial understanding**, not administrative boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Use of **traditional spatial perception** (""老槐荫的传统思想"") indicating long-standing local views.
- Use of **street names and spatial boundaries** to define areas of belonging and otherness.
- Explicitly equating **二环外** (outside the Second Ring Road) with **农村 (countryside)**, which is not just a physical description but a **symbolic boundary** for what counts as ""local"" or urban.
- The phrase **""都比较偏""** implies a **socially accepted spatial hierarchy** within the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing geography or administrative division, but is invoking a **shared, habitual understanding of space** that defines which parts of the city are considered central or peripheral, urban or rural. This kind of **vernacular spatial logic** is used to **draw identity boundaries** and evaluate what areas ""count"" as local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and expresses a **habitual, symbolic understanding of urban space** that defines which areas are considered local or not.

The author is commenting on the inconvenience of public transportation in Jinan, particularly the layout of the subway system, which ""goes around the suburbs,"" making it difficult to travel from the city center to the southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest by public transport or taxi. While this reflects dissatisfaction with the functional livability of the city's transportation system, the author does **not** explicitly or implicitly link this to a standard for defining ""local people"" or evaluating ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""地铁基本上就围着城郊走一圈"" (the subway basically circles the suburbs) – functional livability (transportation).
- ""市区去东南西北...蛮麻烦的"" (it's quite troublesome to go from the city center to the four directions) – spatial accessibility.
- These elements pertain to the **quality of urban infrastructure and convenience**, which could fall under **RL5: Functional Livability**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Despite mentioning transportation inconvenience and the spatial layout of the subway system, the author does **not** suggest that these factors are used to **define who is or isn't a local**, nor do they imply that living in a more accessible area makes someone more ""local."" The discussion remains focused on **transportation issues**, not on **identity boundaries** or **standards of local belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author reminisces about their childhood living in **Daguan Garden (大观园)** in Jinan and describes the **historical spatial perception** of the urban area during that time—bounded by landmarks like Yingxiong Mountain (英雄山), the long-distance bus station, the 101 tram terminal, and Shiermalu (十二马路). They contrast this with their current situation, where their spouse teases them for not knowing many roads in Jinan. The author implies that their **local identity is rooted in a historically bounded, habitual understanding of the city center**, and that this understanding continues to shape their sense of ""local"" space.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of **specific historical spatial boundaries** (英雄山, 长途汽车站, 101终点站, 十二马路) indicate a **habitual, socially shared perception** of the city's core area.  
- Reference to **childhood living experience** (""我小时候住大观园"") suggests emotional and experiential attachment to a specific local geography.  
- The author's **limited current knowledge of the city** is framed not as a failure, but as a **continuation of an older, local spatial framework** (""我只认识一个圈"").

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical, emotionally rooted, and socially shared spatial cognition** to define what ""counts"" as the real or meaningful local space in Jinan. Their current limited navigation of the expanded city is not seen as undermining their local identity, because their sense of belonging is tied to the **traditional or habitual understanding of the city core**.

The author is describing a situation where a roommate from Licheng District is excited about the return of double-decker buses in that area and shares a video to highlight her local connection to it. The author, however, recalls having ridden double-decker buses in childhood and finds the excitement misplaced. There's a subtle contrast between the roommate’s sense of local pride and the author’s more detached or even superior perspective based on earlier exposure.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""She拍了视频给我们特意强调这是她们那边的双层公交车"" (She made a point to show us this is *their* double-decker bus): implies a sense of local ownership or pride in a feature associated with one's area.  
- ""我一个室友就是历程的"" (My roommate is from Licheng): connects identity to place of origin.  
- ""双层公交我记得小时候经常坐"" (I used to ride double-decker buses as a kid): implies the author has a longer-standing connection or familiarity with this urban feature, possibly suggesting a deeper-rooted local identity.  
- ""我们几个小时候就经常坐的同学显摆"" (We who used to ride them as kids are being shown off to): further reinforces a generational or historical connection to the city’s infrastructure as a marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author contrasts their own childhood experience with the novelty that the roommate perceives in the return of double-decker buses. This implies that having a longer historical or generational connection to urban features (like double-decker buses) is a subtle but meaningful marker of ""true"" local identity. The roommate’s pride is implicitly questioned by the author, who suggests that only those who have experienced these things in the past can claim a more authentic local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **generational familiarity with urban features** (e.g., double-decker buses) as a subtle but meaningful standard for judging local identity. This is not about formal administrative boundaries, language, or property, but about **historical and experiential rootedness** in the city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author implies that having grown up in the city and experienced its earlier infrastructure (like double-decker buses) contributes to a more authentic or ""true"" local identity.

This implies a **symbolic self-positioning** based on **status or prestige**, possibly linked to property prices or lifestyle, rather than administrative or spatial definitions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""属不属于济南市区"" (whether it belongs to Jinan’s urban core): This refers to **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and/or **vernacular spatial cognition (RL1)**.
- ""最贵"" (the most expensive): This suggests **functional livability and environmental quality (RL5)**, especially when used to evaluate the desirability or symbolic value of a place.
- The overall tone implies that **identity is defined by self-perceived prestige or economic positioning**, not by objective administrative or cultural criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The author **rejects administrative boundaries** as the main standard for defining ""local identity"" by stating that Longdong doesn't care about being officially part of the city center.
- Instead, the author **emphasizes self-perceived superiority**, likely based on **economic or lifestyle status**, which implies **RL5** (functional livability and environmental quality as symbolic markers of local identity) or **RL6** (social embeddedness and economic positioning as markers of local status).
- There is **no clear endorsement of administrative legitimacy (RL2)** or cultural-linguistic identity (RL4), nor is there any reference to family rootedness (RL3) or occupational typification (RL7).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **economic and environmental quality (e.g., high-end housing, desirable living conditions)** defines the ""local"" identity or status of Longdong.
- This is consistent with **RL5**, which involves evaluating areas based on **livability, amenities, and environmental quality**, and using these to **define what counts as a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area**.
- There is **no explicit mention of social networks or assets (RL6)**, so **RL6 is not strongly supported**.

The author is pointing out that a certain area—described as having a wholesale market, a bus station, and a zoo—is not considered part of the ""市区"" (urban core area). This reflects a judgment about what areas should be seen as genuinely belonging to the city center or not, based on shared spatial perception.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The phrase ""也不算市区啊"" (""isn't considered part of the urban area"") indicates a boundary judgment about spatial identity.
- The area is symbolically described by landmarks (批发市场的汽车站，动物园), not by administrative boundaries or personal history, suggesting a socially recognized perception of urban hierarchy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing on a shared understanding of what constitutes the real or core urban area versus peripheral or non-core areas. This reflects a **habitual or socially accepted spatial cognition**, rather than an administrative or personal standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

They also mention that **Laiwu**, having been recently incorporated into Jinan administratively, is still emotionally identified by most locals as ""Laiwu,"" not ""Jinan."" The author thus highlights both **habitual spatial cognition** (what feels like ""the city"" vs. ""the suburbs"") and **changing administrative boundaries** that do **not align with people's identity**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Felt Licheng was already the suburbs"" → reflects **habitual spatial perception** and emotional mapping of urban boundaries.  
- ""Laiwu was just merged over"" → refers to **administrative change**, but the author notes that people still **identify as Laiwu**, showing a **disconnect between administrative legitimacy and identity perception**.  
- ""Most Laiwu people still identify as Laiwu"" → implies **emotional and historical attachment**, not administrative label, defines identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing administrative legitimacy** as the standard for local identity. Instead, they emphasize that **people's habitual, emotional maps of the city**—not just official boundaries—shape how they define who is ""local"" or how they **feel connected** to a place. This supports **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**.  
While the text **mentions** administrative change (RL2), it does **not endorse** it as a valid standard for identity—instead, it shows how **administrative merger does not override emotional identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- ✅ **RL1 is endorsed**: The author uses habitual perception of space (""Licheng is suburban"") and notes that people in Laiwu still feel like **outsiders** in the new administrative structure, implying that **emotional maps** and **historical identity** are what matter.  
- ❌ **RL2 is not endorsed**: Although administrative merger is mentioned, the author highlights how it **does not align with people's self-perception**, thus **resisting** administrative legitimacy as a standard for identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's **habitual and emotional understanding of spatial boundaries** and how **administrative changes do not overwrite local identity**. The core logic used to define ""local"" is based on **shared historical and emotional spatial perception**, not legal or administrative status.

The author contrasts their own inability to distinguish small regional accents (e.g., between Zhangqiu and Jinan) with their father's ability to distinguish even finer accent differences (among the four city gates). This implies a generational shift in sensitivity to linguistic-cultural markers of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分辨出口音差异"" (distinguish accent differences) and ""口音"" (accent) are key linguistic-cultural markers.
- The author reflects on their own lack of sensitivity to these linguistic differences, which contrasts with the older generation's detailed recognition.
- The text centers on the role of accent as a cultural marker for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that linguistic-cultural recognition (specifically, accent sensitivity) plays a role in how people define and distinguish ""local"" identities. Their own inability to detect these differences suggests a weakening of this criterion across generations.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly endorse accent as a standard for defining ""local people,"" they implicitly acknowledge that it **is** used (especially by the older generation) as a boundary marker for local identity. The author does not resist or negate this logic, and the entire reflection is framed around how accent functions as a cultural-linguistic identity signal.

一部分在历下一部分在历城吧 高新不是行政区划啊,RL2,"  
The author is making a distinction between different geographical areas—specifically mentioning **Lixia**, **Licheng**, and **High-tech Zone**—and emphasizing that **High-tech Zone is not an administrative division**. This reflects an understanding of **local identity** based on **administrative legitimacy**, where only officially recognized administrative regions (like Lixia and Licheng) can be considered valid in defining local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一部分在历下一部分在历城"" (""part in Lixia, part in Licheng"") — refers to distribution across recognized administrative districts.  
- ""高新不是行政区划啊"" (""High-tech Zone is not an administrative division"") — explicitly rejects the idea that non-administrative zones can be used in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly drawing a boundary based on **official administrative status**. They are implying that only areas with formal administrative recognition (like Lixia and Licheng districts) can be used to define local identity, while functional zones like the High-tech Zone—though possibly significant in other ways—do not count in this context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining local identity and explicitly rejects non-administrative zones (like the High-tech Zone) as valid markers of local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** category, as the author uses **administrative division** as the key standard for defining local identity.

The author is describing different districts in Jinan (e.g., Lixia, Shizhong, Tianqiao, Gaoxin, Huaiyin, Licheng, Zhangqiu, Changqing, Pinyin), outlining their characteristics and personal experiences with them. The descriptions include functional features (e.g., facilities, shopping centers), environmental quality (e.g., greenery), and symbolic perceptions (e.g., “upper class people”). The final sentence explicitly states a belief that Zhangqiu, Changqing, and Pinyin are “no longer in the city,” indicating a habitual spatial perception of which areas “count” as the city/local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- District-level spatial descriptions (Lixia, Shizhong, Tianqiao, etc.) show a spatial cognition system.  
- “Facilities齐全,” “convenient to go anywhere,” “Wanda, Daguanyuan, old commercial port,” “occasionally go to the farmers’ market,” “Ikea,” “West Railway Station,” etc., describe functional livability and convenience.  
- “Upper-class people,” “greenery is good” imply symbolic or class-based distinctions.  
- “Zhangqiu, Changqing, Pinyin: already not in the city” is a clear spatial boundary marker based on habitual perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a cognitive map of the city, where different districts have distinct symbolic and functional identities. The most critical part of the argument is the final sentence, which defines the boundary of what counts as “the city” or “local” based on shared, habitual understanding — not administrative boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author discusses functional livability (RL5) and implies social hierarchy (RL6), the **core argument** is about **which areas are perceived as part of the city/local area**, especially the clear demarcation of Zhangqiu, Changqing, and Pinyin as “no longer in the city.” This is based on **shared, habitual spatial cognition**, not administrative boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author uses habitual, socially shared spatial perceptions to define which areas “count” as local and which do not, especially in contrast to administrative boundaries.

Output: RL1"
红谷滩，不过生活成本也相对高一些,(no RL category applies),"  
The author briefly mentions ""Honggutan"" (a district in Nanchang City), and follows up by noting that the ""cost of living is relatively higher."" This appears to be a neutral observation about the economic conditions of the area, focusing on the financial burden of living there.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Honggutan"" is a place name, potentially related to spatial identity or perception.  
- ""Life cost is relatively high"" refers to economic conditions of the area.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author does not express any standard or logic for defining ""local identity."" There is no indication that living in Honggutan, or the high cost of living there, is used as a boundary marker for determining who is ""local"" or what counts as a ""local"" area. The mention of cost of living appears to be a descriptive statement about the area’s economic condition, not a normative standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no evidence that the author uses any of the following to define ""local identity"":
- Spatial perception or emotional attachment (RL1),
- Administrative boundaries (RL2),
- Family rootedness (RL3),
- Linguistic or cultural habits (RL4),
- Functional livability or environmental quality (RL5),
- Social or economic rootedness (RL6),
- Occupational typification (RL7).

The author does not endorse or imply any criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this statement.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not present any criteria that the author uses to define ""local identity,"" no RL categories apply.

啥叫市中心 和传不传统没关系啊 具有文化教育医疗商业在城市领先的地方才是市中心啊 cbd在哪哪就是呗,RL5,"  
The author is challenging the idea that ""traditional"" or historical identity defines the city center. Instead, they argue that the **functional and symbolic role** of an area—specifically its concentration of **advanced cultural, educational, medical, and commercial resources**—is what defines the ""city center."" They also equate this with the **CBD (central business district)**, reinforcing the idea that a place's **functional dominance and modern urban role** determine its status as the ""real"" local core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""文化教育医疗商业在城市领先的地方"" (places where culture, education, healthcare, and commerce are leading in the city) → emphasizes **functional dominance** in urban life.  
- ""CBD在哪哪就是呗"" (wherever the CBD is, that's the city center) → reinforces the **functional and symbolic centrality** of certain areas.  
- Rejection of tradition or history as defining criteria → indicates that the author does **not** endorse RL1 or RL3.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a **functional and symbolic** definition of the city center based on **urban infrastructure and service provision**. This is not just about convenience or personal preference, but about **which areas are considered the ""core"" of the city**—and by implication, where ""real locals"" live or belong. The author sees these areas as the **true centers of local identity** because of their **urban functionality and centrality**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **functional livability and environmental quality**—specifically, the presence of top-tier cultural, educational, medical, and commercial resources—**define what counts as the city center**, and thus, what areas are **symbolically and functionally central to local identity**.  
- This goes beyond mere preference; it is used to **define the symbolic and material hierarchy of local space**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**. The author uses **urban functionality and service provision** as the **core standard for defining the city center**, which in turn defines the **core of local identity**. They are not merely describing convenience—they are constructing a **hierarchy of localness** based on **access to and presence within functionally superior urban spaces**.

哈哈哈 我也是家里三代都在市区 对老南昌人来说市中心就是八一广场附近的商圈 我小时候念的育新嘛 就很夸张 说三十四年以前 二七北路都是郊区,"RL1, RL3","  
The author is sharing their personal background of **family rootedness** in the city for three generations, and they emphasize a **local perception of spatial change**—specifically, that areas like Erqi North Road were once considered suburban but are now part of the urban core. They also mention growing up in a well-known local school (Yuxin School), reinforcing their identification with the city center. This reflects both **family historical rootedness** and **habitual spatial认知** of what constitutes the ""true"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""三代都在市区"" (three generations in the urban area) — clearly points to **family rootedness**.  
- ""市中心就是八一广场附近的商圈"" (the city center is the area around Bayi Square) — reflects **vernacular spatial认知**, a socially accepted understanding of the core local area.  
- ""二七北路都是郊区"" (Erqi North Road used to be suburban) — highlights **change in spatial认知**, reinforcing the symbolic boundary of what is considered the core ""local"" area.  
- ""小时候念的育新"" (attended Yuxin School as a child) — supports the idea of **growing up locally**, reinforcing family and educational rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **family rootedness** (three generations in the city) and **local spatial认知** (Bayi Square as the symbolic city center) to affirm their **""true local"" identity**. They also reference historical spatial transformation to show how local认知 evolves but still centers around a specific area. These are **endorsed standards** for defining who is considered a ""real local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Both **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial认知)** and **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** are **explicitly and implicitly endorsed** by the author as standards for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial认知)** is reflected in the author's belief that the ""city center"" is symbolically centered around Bayi Square and that areas like Erqi North Road used to be considered suburban.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly endorsed through the author’s emphasis on being from a family that has lived in the city for three generations and having grown up locally (e.g., attending Yuxin School).  

These two RL elements are **intertwined** in the author’s expression of what makes someone a ""real local"" in Nanchang.

南昌很多中心地区，只是不同的地方不同的定位，如果说哪里最好，按照房价来，是红谷滩,RL5,"  
The author is discussing how different areas within Nanchang are perceived and valued, particularly focusing on the idea that the ""best"" area can be determined by **price**—specifically, that Honggutan is considered the top area due to its **high housing prices**. This implies a belief that economic value and housing market dynamics are used to evaluate which parts of the city are most desirable or prestigious.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""中心地区"" (central areas) – refers to spatial positioning within the city.  
- ""不同的地方不同的定位"" – indicates differentiated roles or statuses assigned to different areas.  
- ""如果说哪里最好，按照房价来，是红谷滩"" (""if we were to say which area is best, according to housing prices, it's Honggutan"") – clearly links **housing price** to **spatial prestige or desirability**, suggesting a standard for judging which area is superior.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key point the author makes is that **housing prices** serve as a proxy for determining which area is considered the most prestigious or ""best"" in Nanchang. This implies a belief that **economic valuation of space** contributes to the symbolic or functional hierarchy of local areas. While this is not about administrative boundaries, family rootedness, or language, it reflects a **material-based standard** for evaluating local spatial identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **housing prices** as a standard for judging which area is ""best"" — a standard that reflects **spatial desirability and status** within the city. This aligns with the logic of **RL5 (Functional Livability)** when it's used to define what constitutes a desirable or ""true"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **housing prices** — an indicator of **functional livability and environmental quality** — to define which area is superior within the city. This implies a **hierarchical evaluation of local areas** based on material and environmental factors, fitting the **RL5** framework.

老南昌人，现在从红谷滩区老城区还是习惯说“去市内”,RL1,"  
The author is pointing out that **""老南昌人"" (old南昌people)**—those with long-standing local identity—still use the expression **“去市内” (go downtown/into the city)** when referring to going from **Honggutan District or the old city area**. This reflects a **habitual, socially shared spatial认知** that distinguishes certain areas as the symbolic ""city center"" or ""real city,"" implying a **cultural or habitual understanding of spatial boundaries** tied to local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老南昌人"" (old Nanchang people): indicates a group with historical, rooted local identity.  
- ""红谷滩区"" (Honggutan District) and ""老城区"" (old city area): geographical references that distinguish spatial locations.  
- ""习惯说‘去市内’"" (habitually say ""go downtown""): reveals a **linguistic habit reflecting a shared mental map** of which areas are considered the core or central part of the city.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase **“去市内”** is not just a neutral expression—it reflects a **socially habitual way of thinking** about urban space, where certain areas are symbolically elevated as the ""real city"" and others are seen as peripheral, even if administratively part of the city. This habit is associated with the **old Nanchang people**, implying that **this spatial认知 is part of their cultural or identity-based worldview**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **habitual, symbolic spatial认知**—such as which areas are considered “市内” (in the city center)—is a **marker of local identity** and reflects **long-standing local perceptions** of space.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author describes how **shared, habitual understandings of urban spatial categories** are used to define or reflect local identity.

市中心是八一广场那边 所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散 说红谷滩的 真的笑死,RL1,"  
The author is asserting that the true urban core (市中心) is centered around Bayi Square, and that the conceptual one-ring and two-ring roads are defined based on this center. They mock the idea of referring to Honggutan (红谷滩) as part of the city center, indicating a strong attachment to traditional or habitual spatial perceptions of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""市中心是八一广场那边"" (the city center is around Bayi Square) — reflects a socially shared perception of the city's spatial hierarchy.  
- ""所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散"" (the so-called first and second ring roads radiate outward from Bayi Square) — further reinforces this habitual, culturally embedded spatial understanding.  
- ""说红谷滩的 真的笑死"" (saying Honggutan is the city center, really laughable) — mocks the idea of redefining the center, showing resistance to new administrative or developmental narratives.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending a **socially habitual and historically sedimented understanding of urban space**, where Bayi Square is the symbolic and spatial core. This is not based on administrative boundaries or new development, but on **shared local cognition and tradition**. The mockery of Honggutan as the center indicates that the author sees this traditional core as the **authentic basis for defining local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a **socially shared, habitual understanding of urban spatial boundaries**, using it to distinguish between authentic locals and those who do not share this view (e.g., those who consider Honggutan part of the center). This is not about administrative legitimacy (RL2) or livability (RL5), but about **symbolic spatial authority rooted in shared perception**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses and defends a socially habitual, symbolic understanding of the city’s spatial structure to define who has the ""correct"" local perspective.

The author contrasts their personal and collective local memory of南昌 (Nanchang)’s center—八一广场 (Bayi Square)—with the newer 红谷滩 (Honggutan) area. Although Honggutan has developed into a modern, presentable urban district, the author insists that, from a local perspective, the true ""city center"" remains Bayi Square. This reflects a deep emotional and habitual connection to a historically recognized urban core, which informs their understanding of ""local"" identity and spatial belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩我小时候是荒郊野岭"" (""Honggutan was wasteland when I was a kid"") indicates a historical shift in the urban landscape.  
- ""现在如果你要拿出去比面子，用红谷滩那块没毛病"" (""Now if you want to show off the city, Honggutan is fine"") shows recognition of Honggutan’s modern functional and symbolic role.  
- ""但是你要问我们本地人，市中心一定只会是八一广场"" (""But ask us locals, the city center is definitely Bayi Square"") reveals the author's endorsement of a socially habitual and historically rooted understanding of the city center.  
- ""我小时候对南昌的记忆也一定是那边"" (""My childhood memory of Nanchang is definitely there"") supports emotional and experiential attachment to a specific place as the symbolic heart of the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly distinguishes between **administrative or functional changes** (Honggutan as the new urban showcase) and **habitual, socially shared, and historically rooted local perceptions** of where the real center—and thus, the symbolic heart of local identity—lies. This habitual perception of space plays a central role in defining what the author considers the authentic local core.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that ""true locals"" identify the city center based on shared historical and emotional attachment to Bayi Square, not the newer, administratively significant Honggutan. This reflects a **socially sedimented, habitual understanding of urban space** that defines local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author emphasizes a socially shared, historically rooted, and emotionally invested understanding of urban space that defines who counts as a ""local"" and where the authentic center of the city lies.

The author identifies as a ""土生土长南昌人"" (native Nanchang person, born and raised here), and emphasizes that the core area of Nanchang—represented by Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road—has long been recognized as the city center. In contrast, Honggutan was previously undeveloped and is now a newly developed area with many ""外地人"" (non-locals/migrants). Despite its current development, the author implicitly maintains that the traditional core area is more representative of ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长南昌人"" (native Nanchang person) emphasizes family rootedness and long-term local upbringing.  
- ""市中心是东湖区八一广场中山路孺子路等那一片"" (the city center is the area around Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, etc.) reflects habitual, socially accepted spatial cognition.  
- ""红谷滩以前很荒废...现在确实红谷滩发展的很好"" (Honggutan used to be undeveloped, now it's well-developed) indicates a change in functional livability.  
- ""那边很多外地人"" (there are many non-locals there) implies a contrast between traditional locals and newcomers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author defines ""local"" identity based on both long-term familial presence (RL3) and traditional spatial cognition (RL1). The mention of Honggutan's development (RL5) does not serve as a standard for defining ""local people,"" but rather as background context. The contrast with ""外地人"" reinforces the idea that traditional rootedness and spatial belonging are key to being considered truly local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses family rootedness and traditional spatial cognition as the criteria for defining ""local people."" Functional development of Honggutan is acknowledged but not used as a standard for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority – traditional understanding of the city center) and RL3 (Family Rootedness – being born and raised in the area).

The author is challenging the idea that Honggutan (红谷滩) can be considered the city center. They argue that even people who are not native to the area would know—based on traffic radio broadcasts—that traveling from Bayi Bridge to Honggutan is referred to as ""heading out of the city,"" which symbolically places Honggutan outside the core urban area. This implies a habitual or socially accepted understanding of where the ""real"" city center is.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""红谷滩是市中心真的觉得搞笑"" (Calling Honggutan the city center is really funny) – challenges an administrative or functional definition of centrality.  
- ""听下交通广播都知道"" (Just listen to the traffic radio) – refers to shared public knowledge or perception.  
- ""从八一大桥去往红谷滩叫出城方向"" (Going from Bayi Bridge to Honggutan is called 'leaving the city'"") – reflects a socially accepted spatial cognition or boundary perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just expressing a personal opinion but is referencing a **shared, habitual understanding** of urban spatial identity. The phrase ""leaving the city"" used in public discourse (like traffic radio) reinforces a **collective perception** that Honggutan is not part of the core city. This perception is used to **reject the idea** that Honggutan is the city center and thus not part of the ""true"" local urban identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **socially accepted spatial cognition**, rather than administrative or functional definitions, should determine what is considered the core local area. This is a **definition of local identity through shared spatial perception**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is using a **collective, habitual perception of urban space**—evidenced by public discourse (traffic radio)—to define what counts as the real city or local core, and by implication, who counts as local.

The author is reflecting on the transformation of urban identity in南昌 (Nanchang), particularly how the concept of the ""true Nanchang"" has evolved over time. Initially, the traditional perception was that the ""real Nanchang"" was centered around the Donghu area (associated with the old city, particularly the East Lake and八一桥, or Bayi Bridge), and that areas like Honggutan (formerly known as Changbei) were peripheral and undeveloped. However, the author now argues that due to large-scale development—such as the construction of commercial buildings, metro lines, the establishment of a CBD, government relocation, and administrative renaming—Honggutan has become the new core, and thus should now be considered the true center of Nanchang.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""从小在红谷滩长大""** (grew up in Honggutan since childhood): implies personal rootedness and identity formation in the area.
- **""以前是叫昌北的""** (used to be called Changbei): reflects a historical name and perception of the area as separate from the ""true"" Nanchang.
- **""过了八一桥才是真南昌""** (you have to cross Bayi Bridge to be in ""real Nanchang""): reflects traditional spatial perception and boundary marker of local identity.
- **""现在说是南昌的市中心我觉得没毛病""** (now it's fair to call it the city center of Nanchang): indicates a shift in perception and a new definition of local spatial identity.
- **Development indicators** like ""建了很多大厦，开设地铁，引入CBD，各级政府的迁移，改名从红谷滩新区到红谷滩区"" (construction of buildings, metro, CBD, government relocation, administrative renaming): describe the transformation, but the author uses them to justify the area's new status as a core local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is tracing a shift in **socially habitual spatial perception**—from the older view that Donghu and Bayi Bridge marked the boundary of ""real Nanchang,"" to the newer one that sees Honggutan as the legitimate core due to development and administrative changes. This reflects a **change in vernacular spatial authority**, where the author now endorses the new perception and implicitly rejects the old one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author clearly endorses a **revised spatial perception of the local core**, based on **historical change in social views about where the ""true"" local center is**, and how identity is tied to that perception.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text clearly reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author discusses the evolution of **habitual, symbolic spatial categorizations** used to define what counts as the ""real"" local area, and how those perceptions have changed over time to include a newly developed area as the core.

The author is mocking or highlighting the fact that Honggutan New District is not an official administrative division but rather an economic zone. This implies that the author does not recognize it as a ""real"" or legitimate local administrative area, using its non-administrative status to question its local identity or belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Not an administrative district, is an economic zone"" directly references administrative legitimacy (or lack thereof).  
- The mention of keeping an address in Taobao suggests that the author is aware of and plays with the idea of official vs. unofficial local identity markers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the lack of administrative legitimacy as a basis to mock or devalue the status of Honggutan New District in terms of local identity. The tone (""hahaha"") suggests a dismissive attitude, reinforcing the idea that administrative status is the real criterion for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining what counts as a ""real"" local area, and uses the lack of it to exclude Honggutan from that category.

- They do **not** use administrative boundaries, family rootedness, language, economic assets, or occupation as **explicit criteria** for defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author reflects on **how local people’s habitual understanding of city space has evolved**, and how areas like Bayi Square and Honggutan are symbolically and spatially redefined in terms of local identity.

我老公南昌土著，说他小时候红谷滩就是一片荒滩。,RL3,"  
The author is emphasizing her husband's status as a ""Nanchang native"" (南昌土著), which directly signals local identity rooted in long-term family or personal connection to the place. The mention of ""Honggutan being a wasteland when he was a kid"" serves to highlight the transformation of the area over time, but more importantly, it reinforces the husband’s deep-rooted local identity through having witnessed such changes firsthand.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Nanchang native"" (南昌土著) implies local identity based on long-term or generational presence.
- ""When he was a kid, Honggutan was just a wasteland"" implies a long-standing personal or family history in the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key point being conveyed is that the husband is a true local, having grown up in Nanchang and seen the area develop. This implies that local identity is being defined based on personal or familial rootedness in the city over time.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being a ""local"" is defined by long-term personal or family presence in the area — in this case, having grown up in Nanchang and witnessed major changes in its urban landscape.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL3: Family Rootedness, as the author uses the husband’s long-term presence in Nanchang (since childhood) as a basis for identifying him as a ""true local.""

Output: RL3"
红谷滩租房死贵死贵 房价也是,(no label),"  
The author is expressing frustration about the high rental prices and housing costs in Honggutan (Red Sand Bay). This is a complaint about economic conditions in the area but does **not** include any explicit or implicit criteria used to define ""local identity."" There is no discussion of who counts as ""local,"" nor is there any endorsement of standards related to geography, administrative boundaries, family history, language, livability, social integration, or occupation in relation to local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Rent is死贵死贵 (extremely expensive)"" and ""房价也是 (so is the housing price)"" refer to economic factors related to housing costs.  
- However, these observations are purely descriptive and do not serve as **standards for defining local identity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument being made about who is or isn't a ""local."" The author is not proposing or implying any boundary markers (e.g., economic status, residency, cultural traits) that define ""local people."" The high cost of living is mentioned, but it does not function as a criterion for evaluating or defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is **no endorsement** of any standard for defining ""local identity."" The text does not go beyond economic commentary to make any evaluative or definitional claims about local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not contain any RL elements that the author uses to define ""local identity,"" **no RL category applies**.

Output: (no label)"
黄明他妈我见过，标准的市里人，不是胶州口音,RL4,"  
The author is identifying someone’s mother (黄明他妈) as a ""standard city person"" by emphasizing that she does **not** speak with a Jiaozhou accent. This implies that **accent or dialect** is being used as a key marker to distinguish between locals and non-locals, with the absence of a non-local accent serving as evidence of authentic local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""标准的市里人"" (standard city person) — a clear judgment of local identity.  
- ""不是胶州口音"" (not Jiaozhou accent) — linguistic-cultural recognition as a basis for that judgment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic features (accent)** to affirm someone's status as a ""true local."" This reflects a belief that speaking the local dialect or lacking an outsider's accent is a valid standard for identifying who belongs to the local group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **accent** as a valid and sufficient criterion for judging whether someone is a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, which involves using dialect, accent, or cultural speech habits as a boundary marker for local identity.

Output: RL4"
我也是城阳人，听到市里口音够够的，高贵的很,RL4,"  
The author identifies as a ""Chengyang person"" and expresses a clear emotional attitude toward the ""urban area accent"" — using phrases like ""够够的"" (enough already) and ""高贵的很"" (very high-class) — which indicates a sense of distance, even mild resentment or mockery, toward people who speak with a perceived superior urban accent. This implies that accent is being used as a boundary marker between ""us"" (Chengyang locals) and ""them"" (urbanites).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我也是城阳人"" (I'm also a Chengyang person) — self-identification with a specific local group.
- ""听到市里口音够够的"" (When I hear the urban accent, it's enough already) — negative reaction to a specific dialect/accent.
- ""高贵的很"" (Very high-class) — evaluative language suggesting a perception of superiority associated with the urban accent.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses linguistic features — specifically, the urban accent — as a symbolic boundary to distinguish between ""local"" (Chengyang) identity and a perceived elite ""urban"" identity. The emotional tone implies that those with this accent are seen as outsiders or socially distant, even if they are geographically within the broader city. The accent is thus being used as a cultural marker of local belonging (or lack thereof).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **accent** as a standard for distinguishing ""local"" identity, using it to define who belongs to their in-group (""Chengyang people"") and who does not (""市里口音"" — urban-accented people).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the use of **linguistic-cultural recognition** — specifically, accent — as a criterion for defining local identity, aligning with **RL4**.

抱抱，反正在我眼里我只看行政区域划分，属于青岛那就是青岛人，管是胶州还是城阳，早些年因为交通不便利人们觉得隔着远就罢了，现在不管地铁还是开车一会就到了呀,RL2,"  
The author clearly expresses that they believe ""local identity"" should be defined based on **administrative boundaries** — specifically, that anyone from an area administratively belonging to Qingdao (including Jiaozhou and Chengyang) should be considered a Qingdao local. The author dismisses historical perceptions of distance caused by inconvenient transportation and emphasizes that current transportation convenience reinforces their view that administrative boundaries should be the sole criterion for defining ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""只看行政区域划分"" (only look at administrative divisions): clearly indicates a standard based on administrative legitimacy.  
- ""属于青岛那就是青岛人"" (if it belongs to Qingdao, then they are Qingdao people): reinforces the idea that administrative affiliation determines local identity.  
- ""交通不便利"" / ""地铁还是开车一会就到了"" (transportation was inconvenient / now you can get there quickly by subway or car): describes background changes in transportation, but the author does **not** use this as a standard for defining local identity — it serves only to support their main argument about administrative boundaries.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's **core argument** is that administrative boundaries alone should define ""local identity."" They **reject** older views that physical distance or transportation inconvenience justified a more fragmented sense of local belonging. The mention of transportation improvements is **supportive context**, not a defining standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only **administrative legitimacy** is explicitly endorsed by the author as the **sole standard** for defining ""local identity."" Transportation and functional livability are mentioned but **not used as criteria** for judging local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses administrative division as the **exclusive standard** for defining ""local people.""

而且莱西平度跟青岛持平的就剩口音了，别的方面跟青岛都有差距，胶州起码还有地铁机场,"RL4, RL5","  
The author is making a comparison between different regions (Laixi, Pingdu, Jiaozhou) and Qingdao in terms of their level of development and integration with the city. They suggest that Laixi and Pingdu only share a linguistic similarity (accent) with Qingdao, but fall short in other aspects. In contrast, Jiaozhou is noted as having infrastructure like a subway and airport, which implies a closer functional alignment with Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “剩口音了” (""only the accent remains"") points to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).
- “别的方面跟青岛都有差距” (""there are gaps in other aspects compared to Qingdao"") implies a broader evaluation of regional development or livability.
- “胶州起码还有地铁机场” (""Jiaozhou at least has a subway and airport"") refers to functional livability and infrastructure (RL5).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a hierarchy of ""localness"" or closeness to Qingdao identity based on both linguistic similarity and functional development. While Laixi and Pingdu share only a linguistic connection (RL4), they are implicitly positioned as less ""local"" or integrated with Qingdao due to lacking in functional infrastructure. Jiaozhou, by having subway and airport access, is portrayed as more functionally integrated, thus closer to the core ""local"" identity (RL5).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Both linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) and functional livability (RL5) are used by the author to define or evaluate the degree of local identity in relation to Qingdao.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text uses both linguistic markers (accent) and functional infrastructure (transportation access) to assess and differentiate the degree of ""local"" identity among regions. Therefore, it matches both RL4 and RL5.

画多了，应该就是市南+市北（不能过北岭水清沟）+崂山（不能过金家岭），这些才是青岛市里the city哈哈。----土生土长的青岛小嫚现在是老阿姨一枚,RL1,"  
The author humorously defines what they consider to be the ""real"" urban core of Qingdao—specifically, the districts of Shinan, part of Shibei (excluding areas beyond Beiling Shuiqinggou), and part of Laoshan (excluding areas beyond Jinjialing). This reflects a socially habitual, symbolic understanding of which areas ""count"" as the city center. The phrase “土生土长的青岛小嫚” (born and raised in Qingdao) further reinforces a personal connection and authority in defining local spatial identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Explicit spatial boundary definitions: “市南+市北（不能过北岭水清沟）+崂山（不能过金家岭）” indicate habitual or symbolic spatial cognition.
- Use of local identity markers: “土生土长的青岛小嫚” implies rootedness and legitimacy in defining what counts as local.
- The tone (“the city哈哈”) suggests a shared or assumed understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" Qingdao city center.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing symbolic spatial boundaries based on long-standing, shared perceptions of where the ""real"" city is located. These are not administrative boundaries but rather habitual, culturally recognized urban core areas. This functions as a form of **vernacular spatial authority**, used to distinguish ""true locals"" from others.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a habitual, symbolic understanding of spatial boundaries as the basis for defining ""local people"" and ""local area."" They use personal rootedness to legitimize this view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects shared, habitual, and historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories used to define local identity.

我之前去青岛玩，他们说房价最贵的区是在崂山区，可为什么市南区会看不起城建比较新的崂山区，还觉得对方乡下，不懂... 是类似浦西浦东那样吗？,RL1**,"  
The author is expressing confusion about a perceived social hierarchy between two urban districts — **Shinan and Laoshan** in Qingdao — where despite Laoshan having higher housing prices and newer infrastructure, it is still looked down upon by Shinan as ""rural."" The author is trying to understand this identity-based spatial hierarchy, possibly drawing parallels with the well-known **Puxi-Pudong** contrast in Shanghai.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""Housing prices are the highest in Laoshan""** – functional livability (RL5) and potentially social rootedness (RL6).
- **""Shinan looks down on Laoshan""**, **""thinks it's rural""** – implies symbolic spatial cognition and hierarchy (RL1).
- **""Similar to Puxi-Pudong""** – a reference to a known symbolic spatial hierarchy, where newer development does not necessarily translate to symbolic local prestige.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The author is **not endorsing** any of these views but is **inquiring about and describing** the existence of a symbolic spatial hierarchy.
- The author implies that **despite Laoshan’s functional advantages (RL5)** — such as higher housing prices and newer infrastructure — **it is still symbolically considered less ""urban"" or ""local"" than Shinan**, which suggests that the **core issue is about socially constructed spatial perception (RL1)**, not administrative status, family history, or language.
- The **mention of housing prices and infrastructure** serves to **highlight the contradiction** between material advantage and symbolic status, reinforcing that the **author is questioning the basis of local identity and prestige**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **does not explicitly endorse** any standard for defining ""local identity"" but **highlights a contradiction in how areas are symbolically ranked**.
- However, the **core argument centers on the symbolic perception of spatial hierarchy** — that is, how areas are **socially and emotionally mapped** as ""urban"" vs. ""rural"" or ""core"" vs. ""peripheral"" — even when functional advantages exist elsewhere.
- Therefore, the **author implicitly accepts or at least seeks to understand** the **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1), where **Shinan is seen as the symbolic urban core**, and Laoshan, despite its modernity, is not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- This text primarily reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where **habitual or socially accepted symbolic views of space** — not administrative boundaries, economic value, or infrastructure — define perceptions of **local prestige and identity**.
- The **comparison to Puxi-Pudong** further supports this, as it is a well-known example of **symbolic spatial hierarchy** rather than functional or administrative one.

作为土生土长青岛市南人，真不懂谁在搞这些鄙视链！青岛市区上了年纪的人，有几个人在胶南胶州没有老家的亲戚？还不是爷爷辈那辈才进城？另外，市区的高考升学率一直被县级市的学校吊打，当然这和学校不卷有很大关系，很多人后来出国为主。论经济，县级市也出了很多驰名企业。现在的香港路，我幼儿园那阵还是小村庄，这个庄，那个庄的。,(none),"  
The author strongly opposes the idea of a ""hierarchy of localness"" and criticizes the existence of a local identity-based鄙视链 (discriminatory hierarchy). They argue that many older urban residents have family roots in rural areas (e.g., Jiaonan, Jiaozhou), and that their ancestors moved to the city only a generation ago. They also mention the transformation of areas like Hong Kong Road from villages to urban centers, emphasizing that the current urban-rural distinction is relatively recent and superficial. Additionally, they point out that county-level cities outperform urban districts in education and economy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “土生土长青岛市南人” (born and raised in Qingdao Shinan): indicates long-term family rootedness, a potential RL3 element.  
- “爷爷辈那辈才进城” (grandparents' generation moved to the city): implies generational migration history, also relevant to RL3.  
- “胶南胶州没有老家的亲戚” (having relatives in Jiaonan/Jiaozhou): points to rural family roots, again related to RL3.  
- “香港路，我幼儿园那阵还是小村庄” (Hong Kong Road used to be villages): reflects historical spatial transformation, potentially relevant to RL1.  
- “论经济，县级市也出了很多驰名企业” (county-level cities have many famous enterprises): touches on economic status, potentially related to RL6 or RL7.  
- “市区的高考升学率一直被县级市的学校吊打” (urban schools underperform county-level schools): reflects educational outcomes, but not directly used to define local identity.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing** any of these as criteria for defining ""local people."" Instead, they are **critiquing** the use of family rootedness (RL3), historical settlement (RL1), economic performance (RL6), or spatial transformation (RL1) as bases for a hierarchy of local identity. Their argument is that such criteria are arbitrary or outdated, given the shared migration history and current parity (or even superiority) of non-urban areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the criteria are **endorsed** by the author. The author is **explicitly resisting** the idea that family rootedness, historical settlement, or economic performance should be used to distinguish ""true locals"" from others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria as valid for defining local identity and is instead **critiquing** the use of such criteria, **no RL category applies** in this case.

The author discusses how ""local identity"" is constructed and negotiated within their family. They emphasize that although their child's hukou (household registration) is in **Pingdu**, and her father is ""土生土长"" (born and raised) there, the author insists on teaching the child to identify as a **Jinan** person because that's where they currently live. At the same time, the author resists identifying with **Qingdao**, even though the father does, because he is not accepted as a ""real Qingdao person"" by locals. This shows a complex negotiation of identity based on **family rootedness**, **administrative legitimacy**, and **social belonging**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""户口就是平度的""** (hukou is Pingdu) → administrative belonging (RL2).
- **""她爸爸是土生土长平度人""** (her father is born and raised in Pingdu) → family rootedness (RL3).
- **""我从小就教孩子说是济南人""** (I've taught the child since young to say she's from Jinan) → socialization into identity, possibly indicating social embeddedness or cultural认同 (RL6 or RL4).
- **""千万别说是青岛的""** (never say you're from Qingdao) + **""被人家青岛人笑话""** (laughed at by Qingdao locals) → implies linguistic/cultural recognition and social exclusion (RL4).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The **father's family rootedness in Pingdu** (RL3) is acknowledged but not the identity the author wants to pass on.
- The **child's administrative hukou in Pingdu** (RL2) is a fact, but not the identity the author promotes.
- The **author actively teaches the child to identify as Jinan** — indicating that current **social embeddedness and identity formation** (RL6) are central to their concept of local identity.
- The **father's self-identification as Qingdao** is rejected by locals, who judge him based on **linguistic/cultural recognition** (RL4), showing that administrative or familial ties alone are not enough.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **local identity is shaped by upbringing and current social environment** (RL6).
- The author also **implicitly acknowledges** that **linguistic and cultural recognition** (RL4) is a key standard used by locals to judge who belongs.
- Although **hukou** and **family rootedness** are mentioned, the author does **not endorse them as the primary criteria** for defining local identity — instead, they are used to highlight the **gap between official or historical ties and actual social belonging**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- The author emphasizes that **growing up in a place and being embedded in its social fabric** (RL6) is the foundation of local identity.
- They also show awareness that **linguistic and cultural recognition** (RL4) plays a **gatekeeping role** in local identity, even when administrative or familial ties exist.

从我爸妈口中说的，我理解的，我父母年轻时在市南区就已经住楼房了，别的区平房多，再加上交通不便利，出行远环境破旧，才出现的鄙视链而已。,RL5,"  
The author is explaining a perceived hierarchy or ""鄙视链"" (contempt chain) among urban areas, based on descriptions from their parents. The key point is that **residential environment and infrastructure** (如住楼房 vs. 平房), **transportation convenience**, and **urban condition** (环境破旧) are used to justify or explain the formation of this hierarchy. The author is not necessarily endorsing the hierarchy itself, but they are identifying the **criteria that underlie it**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""住楼房"" (lived in apartment buildings)** — indicates better urban infrastructure.  
- **""别的区平房多"" (other districts have many single-story houses)** — implies less developed infrastructure.  
- **""交通不便利，出行远环境破旧"" (inconvenient transportation, long commutes, dilapidated environment)** — functional and environmental disadvantages.  
- These elements are used to explain **why certain areas are seen as superior or inferior**, forming the basis of a symbolic ranking.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is identifying **functional livability and environmental quality** as the **implicit criteria** used by others to define or rank ""local"" areas. Although the author may not personally endorse the hierarchy, they clearly **acknowledge and explain it using these criteria**, indicating that they **recognize** these factors as playing a role in how people judge what constitutes a ""better"" or ""more local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the author critiques the existence of a ""鄙视链,"" they **do accept that the criteria (infrastructure, convenience, environment)** are **used by others** to define or rank local areas. Given that the author presents these as **valid explanatory factors within the context of local identity differentiation**, this qualifies under the RL framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author uses **infrastructure type, transportation convenience, and environmental condition** to explain **how people judge or rank local areas**, which in turn influences the symbolic structure of local identity.

一开始论繁华便利市南是排不上的，后来市南拆迁改造之后就开始睥睨众生了，新建的配套什么的都比原先的好，就像现在的崂山一样,RL5,"  
The author is describing how the perception and status of urban areas change over time in terms of their **functional livability**, particularly focusing on infrastructure and amenities. They contrast the earlier state of **Shinan** (not particularly prosperous or convenient) with its current status after redevelopment (now considered superior), and compare it to **Laoshan**, which is currently seen as having better facilities. The author appears to endorse the idea that **urban development and improved amenities** elevate an area’s status and desirability, thereby influencing how ""local"" or ""central"" it is perceived to be.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “论繁华便利市南是排不上的” — implies that in the past, Shinan was not considered a core or desirable local area in terms of livability.
- “市南拆迁改造之后就开始睥睨众生了” — after redevelopment, Shinan became superior or dominant in status.
- “新建的配套什么的都比原先的好” — new facilities and infrastructure surpass the old ones.
- “就像现在的崂山一样” — comparison with Laoshan, which is currently seen as having good amenities and is becoming a new benchmark.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **functional improvements** (infrastructure, amenities, urban renewal) as a key **evaluation standard** for determining the **status and identity of urban areas**. The transformation of Shinan from a less desirable area to a “proud” one is attributed to **functional livability**, and the author seems to **endorse** this as a valid and important basis for defining what constitutes a high-status or “true” local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly links** urban redevelopment, improved amenities, and functional convenience to the **elevation of an area’s status and its identification as a “local” area**. This is not just a description of physical change but a **value judgment** on what makes an area “count” as a core or prestigious local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates and compares urban areas based on **infrastructure, amenities, and environmental quality**, and uses these as **standards to define or distinguish the status of “local” areas**.

The author is criticizing the long-standing ""local identity hierarchy"" or ""local superiority complex"" in Qingdao — particularly how certain areas (e.g., old Xizhen, old Taixi, or Xinjiazhuang in Shinan) look down on others, and how people from specific districts (e.g., Shinan, Shibei, Sifang, Licang) are considered ""true Qingdao people"" while others are excluded. The author explicitly opposes this discriminatory logic but is describing how it is still practiced.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Old Xizhen"" (老西镇), ""Old Taixi"" (老台东), ""Shinan,"" ""Shibei,"" ""Sifang,"" ""Licang""** — these are spatial categories indicating habitual or symbolic regional identities.
- **""土生土长的青岛人"" (native Qingdao people)** — suggests generational rootedness.
- **""市南>市北>四方>李沧""** — indicates a symbolic ranking based on spatial location.
- **""崂山区都被排除在外""** — shows exclusion based on area.
- **""鄙视链"" (chain of contempt)** — reflects a hierarchy of local identity based on spatial and cultural factors.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not endorsing** these criteria but is describing how **others** define and rank ""local people"" based on **habitual spatial perception** and **symbolic hierarchy**. The text clearly shows that the author believes this spatial-based ranking logic is **still in use** and **widely accepted** by certain groups. Although the author criticizes the logic, they **explicitly describe** how it is used by others to define ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed (or Used) by the Author:  
Even though the author **does not endorse** this ranking system, they are **explicitly describing** how it is used by others to define ""local people."" Since the task is to identify what **criteria are used** (regardless of whether the author approves), we include this.

The criteria being used by local groups (as described in the text) are:
- **Spatial ranking based on habitual or symbolic perception of areas** (e.g., Shinan > Shibei > Sifang > Licang).
- **Exclusion of areas not traditionally considered part of the ""core"" local area** (e.g., Laoshan, ""seven districts and five cities"").
- **Linking ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) with ""true Qingdao person.""**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The text describes a habitual ranking of areas within Qingdao (e.g., Shinan > Shibei > Sifang > Licang), showing that people use **symbolic and socially accepted spatial hierarchies** to define who is considered a ""true local.""
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The phrase **""土生土长的青岛人""** implies that being born and raised in a certain area is used as a standard for local identity.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** Although not directly mentioned, the **""土"" (rural, unrefined)** label implies **cultural or linguistic markers** that are used to distinguish locals from outsiders.

However, the strongest and most explicitly described logic in the text is the **habitual spatial ranking** used by locals to define identity — the **""local鄙视链"" (local hierarchy chain)** — which aligns most directly with **RL1**.

They also note that there are perceptible differences in accents between their area and others. These observations suggest that both **administrative history** and **linguistic-cultural features** play a role in how local identity is perceived or defined.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “莱西以前属于烟台” (Laixi used to belong to Yantai): reflects **administrative boundary changes** and implies that **administrative legitimacy** plays a role in how people perceive identity.
- “口音都不太一样” (the accents are quite different): reflects **linguistic-cultural differences** used to distinguish between local and non-local identities.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is comparing how **historical administrative affiliation** and **linguistic differences** contribute to a sense of shared or distinct local identity. Both elements are used to **question or reflect on what makes a place ""local"" or not**, indicating that the author implicitly accepts these as relevant criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author mentions that Jimo was once administratively part of Yantai. This is a historical statement about administrative affiliation or boundary changes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""归属过"" (once belonged to) points to a past administrative relationship.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a factual statement about Jimo's administrative history. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of administrative boundaries as a standard for defining ""local identity."" The statement lacks any evaluative or identity-based judgment such as ""therefore, people from Jimo are Yantai people"" or ""they should be considered part of Yantai.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text contains administrative historical information, the author does not use this to define or evaluate ""local identity."" There is no endorsement or implication that administrative history should be used to judge who is ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not use administrative legitimacy as a standard to define local identity, this does not meet the criteria for RL2.

因为他们的地区名就是带市，平度市，通常他们说山东省平度市，但是归属青岛市。 但是出去的话就会说是青岛了。,RL2,"  
The author is describing how people from a specific area (平度市) identify themselves depending on the context. When specifying their exact location administratively, they say ""Shandong Province, Pingdu City,"" but when speaking more generally or to outsiders, they identify as ""Qingdao people"" due to Pingdu's administrative affiliation with Qingdao. This reflects an understanding and endorsement of administrative boundaries as a basis for defining local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Their area name includes 'city' (市)"" — indicates a local naming convention, but not directly about defining local identity.
- ""Belongs to Qingdao"" — this is the core point: administrative归属 (affiliation) with a larger city (Qingdao) is used as a basis for identity.
- ""Will say Qingdao when going out"" — indicates a shift in self-identification based on administrative association when communicating with outsiders.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key idea is that administrative legitimacy — the fact that Pingdu belongs to Qingdao — is what leads people to identify as Qingdao locals in broader contexts. This shows that the author endorses administrative affiliation as a valid or commonly accepted standard for defining ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that administrative归属 (归属 Qingdao) is a valid basis for claiming local identity as ""Qingdao people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the logic of **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the speaker accepts administrative affiliation (归属 Qingdao) as a standard for defining who counts as a local.

Output: RL2"
以前平度不在青岛范围 后来规划进去了,RL2,"  
The author is describing a change in administrative boundaries — specifically, that Pingdu was not originally part of Qingdao but was later incorporated into it through planning. The focus is on the **administrative change** that redefined which area is considered part of Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前平度不在青岛范围"" (Pingdu was not in Qingdao's scope before)  
- ""后来规划进去了"" (later planned/included into Qingdao)  
These phrases clearly point to the idea that **administrative designation and planning** determine what counts as part of Qingdao.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses administrative boundary changes as the **core logic** for defining or redefining local identity — if an area is administratively included in Qingdao, then it becomes part of the local scope. This reflects an **administrative legitimacy** standard for defining ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not resist or negate this logic; they present it as a factual basis for determining local belonging. Therefore, it is **endorsed** as a standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses administrative planning and inclusion as the basis for defining what counts as ""local.""

Output: RL2"
我见过一些平度人对我们潍坊归属感比青岛还强,None,"  
The author observes that some people from Pingdu have a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao. This implies a contrast between **official administrative boundaries** and **subjective identity attachment**. The author does not explicitly endorse or reject either perspective but reports a phenomenon where administrative belonging does not align with perceived local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Pingdu people identifying more with Weifang than Qingdao** – suggests a mismatch between administrative classification and personal identity.
- **""归属感"" (sense of belonging)** – indicates emotional or cultural alignment rather than administrative affiliation.
- The statement reflects **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a contested or insufficient standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author highlights a situation where **administrative boundaries (e.g., being part of Qingdao)** do not fully determine or reflect people's **subjective sense of local identity**. This indirectly questions the sufficiency of RL2 as a defining criterion but does **not affirm an alternative standard** (e.g., cultural, spatial, or rootedness-based) in its place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not explicitly endorse** any specific standard for defining local identity. They are **observing a phenomenon** where administrative identity does not align with emotional or cultural identity, but they do not propose or affirm an alternative standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text **mentions administrative boundaries**, it does **not affirm administrative legitimacy as a standard** for defining local identity. It also does **not affirm any other RL standard**. Therefore, **no RL category applies** based on the author’s stance or endorsed criteria.

The author expresses confusion and mild frustration toward the idea of an ""urban hierarchy"" or ""local identity exclusion"" in Qingdao (e.g., ""urbanites look down on others"" or ""locals discriminate against non-locals""). They emphasize their own deep local roots and long-term mobility across multiple Qingdao districts (from birth to work life), and claim not to have personally experienced or perceived any such exclusion or hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长二十五年"" (born and raised here for 25 years) → RL3 (Family Rootedness)  
- Mentions of multiple districts: 平度 (Pingdu), 李沧 (Licang), 城阳 (Chengyang), 市北 (Shibei), 李村 (Licun), 崂山 (Laoshan) → RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)  
- Implicit rejection of identity-based exclusion or hierarchy → suggests the author does not endorse criteria like administrative boundaries, dialect, or occupational identity as defining ""local""  
- No mention of language, occupation, or economic status as criteria → no RL4, RL6, or RL7  
- No explicit or implicit endorsement of functional livability as a standard for local identity → no RL5

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their own life experience — being born and raised in Qingdao and living in various districts — to argue against the existence of a rigid local identity hierarchy. This implies that long-term presence and rootedness across multiple areas (RL3), and the lack of strong spatial identity boundaries (RL1), are the author's implicit criteria for defining who counts as ""local"" in Qingdao.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) and having lived in various parts of the city over time makes one a legitimate local — this aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness** (in a broad sense, including long-term growth history).
- The author's experience across multiple Qingdao districts and lack of perceived spatial hierarchy implies a rejection of rigid spatial identity boundaries, but still shows a habitual understanding of local areas, which aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, though in a deconstructed or inclusive form.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects an implicit endorsement of long-term rootedness and growth history in Qingdao as the standard for local identity (RL3), and a habitual but inclusive understanding of local areas (RL1). The author does **not** endorse administrative, linguistic, occupational, or economic criteria for defining local identity.

碰到过一个从外地搬来青岛的 住在市南区 觉得自己老高贵了 说什么李沧是城乡结合部 崂山全是拆迁户 莱西平度是偏远山区青岛土生土长本地人只会觉得我小岛岛哪都好 最爱我小岛岛,RL3,"  
The author contrasts two perspectives: one from a newcomer (from outside Qingdao) who lives in Shinan District and looks down on other areas like Licang (urban-rural fringe), Laoshan (associated with demolition households), and Laixi/Pingdu (seen as remote mountainous areas). The newcomer appears to judge ""localness"" based on district prestige and residential location. In contrast, the author, who is ""土生土长"" (born and raised here), expresses an emotional and rooted attachment to Qingdao as a whole, implying that ""true local"" identity comes not from where you live now, but from being a native.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从外地搬来青岛"" (moved to Qingdao from elsewhere): indicates migration history.  
- ""住在市南区"" (lives in Shinan District): implies residential location as a basis for perceived superiority.  
- ""李沧是城乡结合部"" (Licang is an urban-rural fringe): reflects habitual spatial cognition and symbolic labeling of areas.  
- ""崂山全是拆迁户"" (Laoshan is full of demolition households): implies a stereotype associated with a certain area.  
- ""莱西平度是偏远山区"" (Laixi and Pingdu are remote mountainous areas): reflects spatial hierarchy perception.  
- ""青岛土生土长本地人"" (native Qingdao person, born and raised here): emphasizes family rootedness and generational belonging.  
- ""我小岛岛哪都好"" (My little island is great everywhere): reflects emotional attachment and holistic认同 (认同 means identification/affection) with the city, not based on specific districts.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly critiques the newcomer’s view that residential location (e.g., Shinan vs. Licang) determines local status. Instead, the author emphasizes that **being born and raised in Qingdao** (RL3) is the real marker of local identity. The references to spatial perceptions (e.g., Licang as urban-rural fringe, Laixi/Pingdu as remote) serve to show how some people use **habitual spatial cognition** (RL1) to rank areas and by extension, people. However, the author rejects this and instead affirms a native identity rooted in personal and generational history.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in Qingdao) as the standard for being a true local → **RL3**.  
- The author **does not endorse** the spatial ranking of districts (e.g., Licang as fringe, Shinan as superior), but rather critiques this view by contrasting it with native identity. Therefore, **RL1 is not endorsed by the author** as a legitimate standard for defining ""local identity.""  
- Although spatial cognition is mentioned, it is used to **highlight the contrast** between the author’s perspective and the newcomer’s, not as a standard the author supports.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects the author's endorsement of **family rootedness and generational belonging** as the key standard for defining ""local identity,"" aligning with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

我李村的，我一个胶州的同事，住在市南租房子，他说我李村不属于市区，笑死人了，后面我才知道他是胶州的。给我拽上了还。,RL1,"  
The author is expressing indignation at a colleague who claims that ""Li Village is not part of the urban area,"" which the author finds ridiculous. The author emphasizes their own identity as from ""Li Village"" and reveals that the colleague is from Jiaozhou, implying that the colleague is asserting a superior local identity. This reflects a tension over who gets to be considered part of the ""urban"" or ""central"" local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Li Village"" and ""Shinan (urban district)"" are references to specific locations.
- ""Doesn’t belong to the urban area"" indicates a boundary demarcation based on spatial perception.
- The colleague’s identity as ""from Jiaozhou"" is highlighted, suggesting a contrast in perceived local legitimacy.
- The tone implies that there is a hierarchy or symbolic ranking of areas within the city, with ""urban"" areas considered more authentically local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is challenging the colleague’s claim that Li Village is not part of the urban area, suggesting that there is a shared understanding or social convention about which areas count as ""urban"" or ""central"" and thus more legitimate in terms of local identity. The author implicitly resists the idea that only people from certain areas (like the urban core or certain districts) can be considered true locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a vernacular understanding of spatial boundaries — that is, a shared or habitual perception of which areas count as part of the city or urban core. The colleague’s assertion that ""Li Village is not part of the city"" is presented as incorrect or pretentious, suggesting that the author supports a broader or more inclusive spatial identity framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author’s use of **shared or habitual spatial perceptions** — not official administrative boundaries — to define what counts as ""local"" or ""urban."" This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is defending the symbolic legitimacy of Li Village as part of the local urban identity.

Output: RL1"
李村属于即墨方言,RL4,"  
The author is stating that ""Li Village belongs to the Jimo dialect."" This implies a linguistic boundary or classification, linking the village to a specific dialect area. The statement reflects a cultural-linguistic recognition based on dialectal affiliation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""属于即墨方言"" (""belongs to the Jimo dialect"") indicates a linguistic connection.
- This links the identity or classification of a place (and potentially its people) to a specific dialect group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using dialectal belonging as a way to categorize or define the identity of the village and, by extension, its residents. This implies that speaking or being associated with the Jimo dialect is a marker of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses dialectal affiliation (Jimo dialect) as a standard for defining or recognizing local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, as the author uses dialectal belonging as a boundary marker for local identity.

Output: RL4"
我潍坊人，平度以前属于潍坊过，所以现在还有一些老一辈平度人的对潍坊归属感比青岛强,RL2,"  
The author identifies as a Weifang native and explains that because Pingdu used to belong to Weifang administratively, some older Pingdu residents still feel a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao. This implies a lingering emotional or identity connection based on past administrative boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""I’m a Weifang person"" indicates self-identification with a place.
- ""Pingdu used to belong to Weifang"" points to historical administrative affiliation.
- ""Some older Pingdu people still feel stronger belonging to Weifang"" shows that past administrative legitimacy still influences current local identity perception.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just stating a historical fact, but is pointing out that this past administrative boundary still plays a role in shaping local identity for some people. This reflects how administrative legitimacy, even when no longer current, can still carry symbolic and emotional weight in defining ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that past administrative affiliation (Weifang's historical inclusion of Pingdu) still influences local identity and belonging today.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, because the author suggests that historical administrative boundaries still influence current local identity perception and emotional attachment.

The author recounts their personal background and family situation, emphasizing their deep local roots (""我市南土生土长的"" — born and raised in the southern part of the city), their family's property ownership across multiple districts, and the social commentary they receive from others, especially neighbors. The author resists being labeled or judged by others' standards of what constitutes a ""local"" or ""urban"" lifestyle, such as living in a certain area or having amenities like heating. They convey a sense of local legitimacy based on origin, property, and social embeddedness, while rejecting outsider judgments.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) — indicates family rootedness and generational connection.
- ""上学的时候去了烟台"" (went to school in Yantai) — temporary migration for education, not affecting local identity.
- ""嫁了胶州小伙子"" (married a man from Jiaozhou) — introduces a new local connection through family.
- ""我家市区有七八套房子"" (we own 7–8 properties in the city center), ""胶州城阳也都有房子"" (also have houses in Jiaozhou and Chengyang) — indicates economic and spatial embeddedness.
- ""爸妈现在住崂山"" (parents now live in Laoshan) — further spatial rootedness.
- ""邻居都会说我终于从村里进城了"" (neighbors say I’ve finally moved from the village to the city) — implies others judge based on place of residence and lifestyle.
- ""你在胶州是不是住不上有暖气的房子"" (do you even have heating in Jiaozhou?) — implies others use functional livability (amenities) as a proxy for local legitimacy or urban identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author implicitly asserts their local legitimacy through multiple dimensions: family origin (RL3), property ownership (RL6), and spatial mobility within the urban region. They reject others' attempts to demote their status or question their local belonging based on where they live or what amenities they have (RL5 and RL1 judgments), suggesting they do not endorse those criteria as valid for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author explicitly endorses:
- Being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) as a basis of local identity → **RL3**.
- Owning property across multiple districts as a form of embeddedness and legitimacy → **RL6**.

The author **rejects**:
- Judging local identity based on current residence location alone (e.g., living in Jiaozhou or崂山) → **not RL1**.
- Using functional amenities (like heating) as a proxy for local identity → **not RL5**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The author defines their own ""local identity"" primarily through **family rootedness** (RL3) and **property ownership/social embeddedness** (RL6), while resisting definitions based on spatial or infrastructural criteria.

The author identifies as from Jimo and expresses a clear evaluative stance: Jimo dialect, along with other related dialects (Laoshan, Chengyang, Licun, Pingdu, etc.), is considered the ""authentic native dialect"" of Qingdao. In contrast, ""new Qingdao dialect"" is described as a product of linguistic fusion between immigrants and native speakers. This implies that linguistic heritage is central to defining ""local"" identity in Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我即墨的"" (I'm from Jimo) indicates the author's self-identification with a specific local origin.  
- ""即墨话……才是正宗的青岛土著方言"" (Jimo dialect is the authentic native Qingdao dialect) emphasizes linguistic rootedness and cultural legitimacy.  
- ""新青岛话是外地移民讨生活跟土著人方言碰撞融合形成的"" (New Qingdao dialect is a fusion of immigrant and native dialects) contrasts ""authentic"" local speech with later linguistic developments tied to migration.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses dialect as a symbolic boundary to distinguish between ""authentic locals"" and others. Jimo dialect is not only a linguistic feature but a cultural marker of being a ""true native"" of Qingdao. This implies that linguistic-cultural recognition plays a key role in defining who is considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that speaking the original, authentic Qingdao dialect (specifically Jimo and related varieties) is a key criterion for being considered a ""true local."" This is not just a description of linguistic change but a value judgment about cultural legitimacy and local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses dialect and linguistic heritage as the core standard to define ""true local"" identity in Qingdao.

The author recounts a personal experience of being judged by a local (Qingdao aunt) based on both **hukou** (household registration) and **place of residence** (Huangdao). They respond by asserting their **own legitimacy as a local** through **economic participation** (working, paying for services), **social integration** (building a life circle and friend circle), and **residential presence** (owning property). They reject the idea that they need recognition from those with **hereditary or traditional local status** (e.g., descendants of fishermen) to be considered local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **Administrative belonging (RL2):** The Qingdao aunt emphasizes the author’s **hukou** being from Liaoning, not Qingdao, as a reason for not being a local.
- **Vernacular spatial cognition (RL1):** Huangdao is treated as **symbolically outside Qingdao**, even if administratively part of it.
- **Social embeddedness (RL6):** The author emphasizes **owning property**, **working**, **earning money**, and **building social networks** in Qingdao as the basis of their local identity.
- **Functional livability (RL5):** Implicitly present in the discussion of **daily life integration** (dining, buying fish, taxi), but not the core argument.
- **Occupational typification (RL7):** The author contrasts **""fishermen's descendants""** with their own **professional identity** and **economic power**, suggesting a symbolic boundary.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
- The author **rejects** the Qingdao aunt’s **RL1 and RL2 standards** (place of origin and symbolic spatial exclusion of Huangdao), but **acknowledges their existence** as criteria used by others.
- The author **constructs their own standard** based on **RL6 (social embeddedness)**: economic participation, residential ownership, and social integration.
- The mention of **RL7 (occupational symbolism)** serves to **reject the idea that hereditary occupation or lineage determines local identity**, but it is still **used functionally** to contrast two visions of local belonging.
- RL5 is **present but not central**; convenience and participation in urban life are **supporting features**, not the **core logic** of the author’s claim to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **explicitly endorses** the **RL6 standard** (social embeddedness) as the **true basis of local identity**.
- The author **implicitly acknowledges** the **RL1 and RL2 standards** as criteria used by others, but **does not endorse them**.
- The author **uses RL7 contrastively** to **criticize lineage-based identity**, suggesting that **economic and social participation** (RL6) should outweigh occupational lineage.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- The **core endorsed standard** is **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**: the author defines their local identity based on **economic participation, property ownership, and social integration** in Qingdao.
- Although **RL1, RL2, and RL7** are referenced, they are **not endorsed** as the author’s own standard for defining local identity.

The author strongly resists the idea that certain areas (like Jimo, Jiaozhou, Laixi, etc.) should now be considered part of Qingdao in terms of local identity. They emphasize that these were historically independent cities (""即墨市, 胶州市, etc."") and are thus not inherently ""Qingdao"" in identity. The author also highlights differences in **accent**, **customs**, and **identity perception**, arguing that forced inclusion ignores long-standing **social habit-based spatial distinctions** and **linguistic-cultural differences**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""Administrative merger in recent decades"" — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)

- ""Some habits are different"" — RL4
- ""You are not me, why do you insist you are me?"" — RL1 + RL4
- ""I am in pain"" — emotional expression reinforcing the author’s attachment to local identity boundaries

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author explicitly **rejects administrative merger as a sufficient condition** for shared local identity (RL2), instead emphasizing **historical spatial identity** (RL1) and **linguistic-cultural differences** (RL4) as the real markers of local identity. These are the **core criteria the author uses to argue that these areas should not be considered part of Qingdao identity**.

The author is making a clear argument about **historical and cultural continuity** in defining local identity. They emphasize that the area has ""always been Jimo's territory"" and that the ""indigenous people"" (土著) are Jimo people. The author further clarifies what they mean by ""Jimo"" by excluding other current areas with similar names and specifying a historical and cultural definition — from the Sui Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, where the region shared **unified culture, dialect, and customs**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""自古以来"" (since ancient times), ""土著"" (indigenous/native people), ""即墨的地盘"" (Jimo's territory) — these all point to **historical and habitual spatial perception**.
- The emphasis on **shared dialect, culture, and customs** indicates **cultural-linguistic recognition**.
- The author is not merely describing administrative boundaries today, but a **historical-cultural region**, which implies a **socially accepted or habitual understanding** of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical continuity and cultural unity** to define who counts as a ""local"" — the **""native"" Jimo people** — and distinguishes this group from others who may live in areas now bearing similar names but lack the same historical-cultural continuity. This is not about current administrative divisions (RL2), but about **socially and historically sedimented understandings** of who belongs and where the ""true"" local area is.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

- **""Chengyang roommate wants a boyfriend from Shinan or Shibei"" / ""looks down on Huangdao boy because he's from Huangdao""** — shows **spatial hierarchy and symbolic ranking of districts**, aligning with **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1).
- **""Jiaozhou isn't designated as a district"" / ""Jiaonan is poor""** — although economic evaluation is mentioned, it is used to support the **spatial and administrative ranking**, not as a standalone criterion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text reveals that **administrative designation (RL2)** is seen as a key marker of legitimacy and local identity. This administrative boundary is used to justify **social hierarchy (RL6)** and **spatial ranking (RL1)**, where certain districts are considered superior or more desirable for social integration. The author does not explicitly oppose these views, suggesting a passive endorsement of the logic used to define ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses:
- The **administrative boundary/status** as a standard for local identity (RL2).
- The **social ranking and exclusion** based on district identity (RL6).
- The **spatial hierarchy and symbolic meaning** of certain districts (RL1).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects multiple standards used to define ""local identity"":
- **RL1** is reflected in the symbolic ranking of areas and the idea that some places ""count"" more than others.
- **RL2** is directly mentioned in the debate over whether a place is ""designated as a district.""
- **RL6** is evident in the social preferences and relationships shaped by district identity.

我老公认识我的时候，说他是黄岛的，拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系～很长一段时间我单纯的以为黄岛是一个单独的地方，跟青岛没关～,RL1,"  
The author recounts how her husband initially refused to associate himself with Qingdao, identifying only as from Huangdao. She believed for a long time that Huangdao was a separate place unrelated to Qingdao. This reflects a **socially habitual perception** of spatial boundaries—where people distinguish Huangdao as a distinct area, even if administratively it may belong to Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Said he was from Huangdao,拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系"" (refused to admit any connection with Qingdao) indicates a **socially constructed spatial identity**.
- ""I thought Huangdao was a separate place unrelated to Qingdao"" shows a **habitual, non-administrative understanding of spatial boundaries**.
- The narrative centers on **how people perceive and identify spatially**, not on administrative facts or legal belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not arguing based on administrative boundaries or family roots, but rather on the **shared perception or social habit** that Huangdao is distinct from Qingdao. This reflects a **vernacular spatial logic** that people use to define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly affirms the **habitual, socially accepted understanding** that Huangdao is a separate local space from Qingdao, despite possible administrative integration.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where **socially shared perceptions of space**—not official boundaries—are used to define local identity and spatial belonging.

胶东机场对市区来说远 我承认 但是那些市区的动不动的就潍坊机场 给潍坊建的机场 怎么的 合着胶州被你们划到潍坊去了呗？,RL2,"  
The author is expressing frustration over a perceived inconsistency or unfairness in how **Jiaozhou** is administratively or spatially categorized. They acknowledge that **Jiaodong Airport** is far from the city center, but object to people in the city referring to **Weifang Airport** as a nearby alternative. The rhetorical question “Has Jiaozhou been划到 (assigned to) Weifang?” implies that the speaker believes Jiaozhou should be considered part of Qingdao, not treated as if it's closer to or part of Weifang. This reflects a **claim to administrative belonging** and a **resistance to symbolic exclusion** from the urban core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""Jiaozhou""** is the central location being discussed in terms of belonging.
- **""Weifang""** is used as a contrasting location — a city outside Qingdao — implying that treating Jiaozhou as closer to Weifang excludes it from being truly part of Qingdao.
- **""划到"" (assigned/annexed)** directly references administrative redistricting logic.
- The rhetorical tone suggests the speaker **resists** being treated as ""outside"" or ""not local"" to Qingdao due to location or infrastructure planning.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not merely complaining about distance; they are **defending Jiaozhou’s status as part of Qingdao** and rejecting the implication (from others) that it is more aligned with Weifang. This is a **claim to administrative legitimacy** — a belief that where one is located administratively (or how it is perceived) determines whether one is considered a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that administrative belonging (rather than geographic convenience or infrastructure access) should be the basis for determining who is considered a local of Qingdao.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text clearly reflects **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author is arguing against being symbolically or functionally excluded from Qingdao based on infrastructure planning, and instead insists on administrative boundaries as the correct standard for defining ""local.""

这个鄙视链是在老一辈那，因为当时青岛交通不发达，只有市南市北住人多，李沧黄岛是农村种地多。,RL1,"  
The author is explaining the origin of a perceived social hierarchy or ""chain of disdain"" (鄙视链) that exists among the older generation. This hierarchy is based on historical patterns of urban development and spatial distribution — specifically, that areas like Shinan and Shibei were traditionally more urbanized and densely populated, while Licang and Huangdao were rural and agricultural. The author does not explicitly endorse this hierarchy but explains that it stems from historical and spatial perceptions tied to the older generation's experiences.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""鄙视链"" (chain of disdain) implies a symbolic ranking system based on place of residence.  
- ""市南市北住人多"" (more people live in Shinan and Shibei) suggests a perception of centrality and urbanity.  
- ""李沧黄岛是农村种地多"" (Licang and Huangdao are rural with more farmland) reflects historical spatial categorization and land use.  
- ""在老一辈那"" (in the older generation's view) clarifies that the speaker is not necessarily endorsing the standard but describing its origin.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not personally endorsing the spatial hierarchy but is explaining that it originates from historically sedimented perceptions of urban-rural spatial distribution. These perceptions, rooted in the past when transportation and integration were limited, formed a collective understanding of which areas were ""central"" and which were ""peripheral” — a form of habitual or historical spatial cognition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly endorse the hierarchy, they do acknowledge that it is based on **historically sedimented spatial perceptions** — specifically, the contrast between urban (Shinan/Shibei) and rural (Licang/Huangdao) areas. These are not administrative, linguistic, or economic criteria but rather **socially shared spatial understandings** rooted in history.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects historically sedimented, socially shared perceptions of urban and rural areas that have shaped a symbolic hierarchy of local identity, especially among the older generation.

但我得承认小时候我确实真情实意的认为平度、即墨不是青岛的就是，那个时候的说法都是去周末去平度/即墨玩儿，晚上抓紧时间赶回青岛（算狭义青岛吧）。就像我也曾以为寿光不是潍坊的，诸暨跟绍兴没关系，余姚也跟宁波没关系一样……但这种认知并不涉及歧视，就是日常用语会造成的模糊,RL1,"  
The author reflects on their childhood perception of spatial identity, admitting that they once genuinely believed certain areas (e.g., Pingdu, Jimo) were not part of Qingdao, and that going there was like visiting a different place. They also compare this to similar mistaken beliefs about other cities (e.g., Shouguang not being part of Weifang, Zhuji not being related to Shaoxing, Yuyao not being part of Ningbo). Importantly, the author clarifies that this was not based on discrimination, but rather on habitual language and conceptual boundaries that cause confusion or ambiguity in defining what ""counts"" as the local city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""平度、即墨不是青岛的"" (Pingdu and Jimo are not part of Qingdao) reflects a habitual or mistaken spatial perception.
- ""去周末去平度/即墨玩儿，晚上抓紧时间赶回青岛"" (go to Pingdu/Jimo on weekends and hurry back to Qingdao at night) implies a symbolic boundary between ""local core"" and ""non-core"" areas.
- The author refers to a ""狭义青岛"" (narrow sense of Qingdao), indicating a socially constructed or habitual understanding of urban boundaries.
- Analogies to other cities (Shouguang–Weifang, Zhuji–Shaoxing, Yuyao–Ningbo) reinforce the idea that this is about conventional spatial cognition, not administrative or legal criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not promoting exclusion or discrimination, but is describing how **habitual, culturally shared spatial understandings** can shape people's sense of what areas are ""truly"" local. This reflects a **socially sedimented, vernacular perception of spatial boundaries**, which may differ from administrative definitions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **people, including their younger self, often use habitual, culturally shared understandings of space** to distinguish what counts as ""local"" or not, even if this understanding is later revised. This is not about administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, or economic status, but about **symbolic and habitual spatial cognition**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author describes how **habitual, culturally shared, and often mistaken understandings of urban boundaries** are used to define what counts as the ""real"" local city or area, even if this is later recognized as an imprecise or ambiguous way of thinking.

我外地人在青岛生活十多年，公里公道说句，其实日常生活中青岛人没有表现出来青岛区域歧视，但是在偶有的聊天或者一些言论里，能看出来多少会带点儿那种感觉，比如他们会特指一些，像说那个沧口曼儿，或者说青岛话的口音，会问你家哪个区的，城阳的，哦，怪不得，你们懂那种感觉吧，但毕竟我不是青岛人，就听他们聊天中就会有那种地域划分和主城区优越感的只字片语，倒是说不上歧视什么的,"RL1, RL4","  
The author, an outsider who has lived in Qingdao for over a decade, acknowledges that while Qingdao locals generally do not show overt discrimination, there are subtle indicators of local identity boundaries in their speech and perception. These include referencing specific local areas (e.g., Cangkou), using Qingdao dialect, and making distinctions based on which district someone is from. The author perceives an implicit sense of主城区优越感 (urban core superiority) and regional division among locals.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of **local areas** (Cangkou, Chengyang) and **district distinctions** (你家哪个区的) implies habitual or socially accepted spatial categorization.
- Use of **Qingdao dialect** and attention to **accent** indicates linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker.
- Implicit **urban core superiority** and **regional division** suggest a habitual spatial cognitive structure.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author observes that Qingdao locals use **habitual spatial categories** (e.g., Cangkou as a symbolic label) and **linguistic features** (Qingdao dialect, accent) to subtly define local identity boundaries. These are not administrative or legal distinctions, nor are they based on economic or occupational status, but rather on **socially sedimented perceptions** and **cultural-linguistic recognition** that reflect **local identity logic**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not personally endorse these standards but **observes and reports** that Qingdao locals **implicitly use** these criteria to define ""local"" identity. Since the task is to identify what **the author believes** defines ""local people,"" and the author is **describing others’ views** without endorsing them, we must **exclude** any RLs that the author does not personally endorse.

However, there is a **subtle ambiguity**: the author says “they would specifically mention...” and “you know that feeling,” which might suggest **some level of recognition or internalization** of these distinctions, even if not explicitly endorsed. Still, the overall tone is **observational and neutral**, not affirming the validity of these standards.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Even though the author does not explicitly endorse these standards, the **core argument involves describing how Qingdao locals define ""local identity""** using **habitual spatial perception** (e.g., Cangkou as a symbolic area) and **linguistic-cultural markers** (Qingdao dialect, accent). Since the author **implicitly accepts the existence and relevance of these standards** in shaping local identity perception, and **does not reject them**, they qualify under the RL framework.

- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author reports that locals use habitual or symbolic area distinctions (e.g., Cangkou) and district-based questions to define local belonging.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author notes that locals pay attention to Qingdao dialect and accent as identity markers.

The author expresses deep emotional attachment and nostalgia for their hometown, emphasizing their ""土生土长"" (born and raised) identity as a **local person of Pingdu**, specifically from **Nancun**. They describe the local lifestyle, seasonal customs, and regional products that shaped their childhood and identity. Despite acknowledging the city's current economic shortcomings, the author still strongly identifies with Pingdu and its local culture.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长平度人""** (born and raised Pingdu person): indicates family rootedness and generational connection.  
- **""平度南村人""**, **""高中搬家到一中附近""**: references to specific local places and upbringing history.  
- **Mentions of local products and customs**: e.g., **strawberries, cherries, watermelons, grapes, local dishes**, and **KFC egg tarts from Wangdi**—these reflect cultural and emotional ties to the place.  
- **""平度超级好""** (Pingdu is really great): shows strong local identity and pride.  
- **""没有大型综合性商超""**, **""财政岌岌可危""**: comments on functional livability and economic status, but framed as background rather than identity criteria.  
- **Nostalgic references to local shops and streets**: reflect emotional and social embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The core of the author's argument is rooted in their **personal history and emotional connection to Pingdu**, especially the **local upbringing and generational experience**. They use **local customs, food, and upbringing memories** to reinforce their sense of belonging. While economic and social conditions are mentioned, they are not used to define or exclude ""local identity""—rather, the author affirms their local identity **despite** these shortcomings.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in Pingdu) is the foundation of being a ""true local.""  
- The **emotional and cultural connection to the local area** is clearly rooted in **long-term personal and family history**, not just functional or economic conditions.  
- Although **RL5** (functional livability) and **RL6** (social embeddedness) are **implied** through nostalgic references, they are **not used as criteria** to define who is ""local""—they are **emotional reflections** of the author’s identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects a **local identity based on being born and raised in a place, with deep family and generational roots**, which aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。",** (None),"  
The author critically examines the phenomenon of certain groups (e to define who is or isn't a ""real""青岛 (Qingdao) person, highlighting how multiple criteria—though administratively unified—are used to create social and symbolic boundaries. The author clearly opposes this exclusionary logic and provides a multi-dimensional analysis of the criteria used by others to justify it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Administrative divisions:** Explicitly acknowledged as belonging to Qingdao, yet socially excluded.  
- **Education system isolation:** Certain districts are excluded from key educational resources (e.g., 2, 58, 1, 9 high schools), reinforcing identity boundaries.  
- **Dialect and accent differences:** Main urban areas have accents closer to Mandarin, while suburban districts retain stronger local dialects.  
- **Transportation barriers:** Toll roads and tunnels create physical and symbolic separation, reinforcing the idea of ""coming into the city.""  
- **Economic disparities:** Income levels align with the perceived hierarchy of ""localness.""  
- **Social identity construction and exclusion:** The idea of ""colonial inheritance"" and ""convert's zeal"" is used to explain how some urban residents construct superiority over others.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author clearly opposes the exclusionary logic, they **describe and analyze** the various criteria used by others to define ""local identity."" Importantly, the author **does not endorse** these criteria but rather **critiques them**. However, the text still **explicitly identifies and explains** how these criteria function in the broader discourse of local identity exclusion, even if the author does not personally endorse them.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not personally endorse** any of the RL criteria. However, the text **clearly explains how others use these criteria to define ""local identity""** and **how they are socially and symbolically operationalized** in local discourse. According to the annotation guidelines, the task is to identify what **the author themselves explicitly endorse or implicitly convey** as criteria **they use** to define ""local identity."" Since the author **explicitly resists and critiques** these criteria, and does **not endorse them**, they should **not** be annotated.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text contains rich discussion of multiple RL categories (RL1–RL7), none are endorsed or used by the author as their own criteria for defining ""local identity."" The author's stance is one of critique and resistance to these exclusionary standards.

你这种海归硕士去市南或者地铁溜一圈一大推大姨让你娶她曼很喜欢你这种高学历的,RL7,"  
The author is making an ironic or semi-serious comment about a social stereotype: that highly educated returnees (like the person being addressed) are seen as desirable marriage prospects, especially by certain local social groups (e.g., ""aunts"" met on the subway in Shinan district). The underlying implication is that high educational attainment is associated with social desirability and local marriageability, especially in certain areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""海归硕士"" (overseas returnee with a master's degree) indicates high educational and possibly class status.
- ""市南"" (Shinan district) is referenced as a specific area where such people are socially visible or desirable.
- ""地铁"" (subway) is a space of social interaction where such visibility occurs.
- ""大姨让你娶她"" (aunties want to marry you off) implies social embeddedness and desirability within local social networks.
- The statement implies that educational and class status contribute to being seen as a ""desirable local"" or as someone who could be socially integrated into the local community.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author links educational background (as a proxy for class and social capital) with local social integration and desirability. Although the tone is humorous or exaggerated, the underlying logic is that certain educational and professional backgrounds make someone more acceptable or desirable within local social networks—especially in a specific district (Shinan), which may carry symbolic or class-based meanings.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts or comments on the idea that high educational attainment and class status make someone more integrated or acceptable within local social networks in certain areas. This reflects a symbolic hierarchy tied to both occupation and social embeddedness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects **RL7: Occupational Typification**, because it uses a high-status educational background (as a stand-in for profession and class) to symbolically distinguish a desirable or notable type of person within a local context—especially in contrast to other groups who might not be seen as ""marriageable"" or socially acceptable. The statement links occupational/class status to local identity differentiation.

我是李村的，感觉可能很多人对青岛有争论可能是对“青岛”这个所谓的概念站在不同角度去理解的。仅从个人的认识来说，如果说是市的层面，我的观念感觉城阳即墨胶州西海岸都可以说是青岛，平度莱西确实是有点太远了，总感觉名义上的，我确实对那边缺少同在一个青岛的归属感。如果说是岛的层面，那我认为红岛和黄岛肯定不属于青岛，这三个应该是并列的，青岛的话我认为城阳的流亭以南，加上市内四区的范围都叫青岛。,RL1,"  
The author is attempting to clarify what ""counts as青岛 (Qingdao)"" by offering their own interpretation of the term based on different spatial conceptualizations — one at the municipal level and another at the island level. They emphasize that certain areas (e.g., Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, West Coast) feel more integrated into the identity of Qingdao, while others (e.g., Pingdu, Laixi) feel more distant and lack a sense of shared belonging. They also distinguish areas like Hongdao and Huangdao from the core identity of Qingdao.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author discusses **which areas “count” as Qingdao** and which do not, based on **habitual or symbolic spatial understanding**, not just administrative boundaries.  
- They emphasize a **cognitive boundary** (e.g., Liuting in Chengyang as a dividing line), indicating a **socially shared or personal mental map** of what constitutes the ""real Qingdao.""  
- The author also distinguishes between **municipal-level Qingdao** and **island-level Qingdao**, indicating a **symbolic or conceptual use of space** rather than a purely administrative or functional one.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a **subjective but socially grounded spatial framework** to define what constitutes the **core of Qingdao identity**. The key is not administrative legitimacy or economic function, but rather a **habitual, symbolic, or emotionally resonant understanding of space** — which is central to how they determine who or what “feels like Qingdao.” The exclusion of Pingdu, Laixi, Hongdao, and Huangdao from the “real Qingdao” is based on **lack of shared symbolic belonging**, not administrative or functional criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses a habitual and symbolic understanding of spatial boundaries** as the basis for defining what constitutes Qingdao in terms of identity and belonging. This is not about administrative divisions (RL2), family roots (RL3), language (RL4), or economic status (RL6), but about **shared or habitual spatial cognition**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author uses **habitual, symbolic, or emotionally grounded spatial understandings** to define the scope and identity of ""Qingdao.""

完蛋，我们都是郊区人,RL1,"  
The author uses the phrase ""完蛋"" (ruined/doomed) to express a sense of identity-related disappointment or marginalization. The phrase ""我们都是郊区人"" (""we are all suburban people"") indicates a self-identification or labeling based on spatial location, reflecting a perception of being outside the urban core and thus excluded from a more desirable or authentic ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""郊区人"" (""suburban people"") implies a spatial identity that contrasts with the urban core.
- The tone suggests that being labeled as ""suburban"" carries a negative connotation in terms of local identity or status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts a spatial hierarchy in which being from the suburbs is seen as inferior or marginal in terms of ""local"" identity. This reflects a shared understanding of spatial categories and their symbolic meanings in defining who counts as ""truly local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a spatial categorization system that distinguishes between core urban and suburban areas, using suburban identity as a marker of exclusion from the ideal ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses a self-deprecating spatial label (""suburban people"") that reflects a shared social perception of spatial hierarchy and identity, used to define who is or is not part of the core ""local"" group.

Output: RL1"
何止交通？医疗教育购物等等,RL5,"  
The author is emphasizing that the advantages of an area go beyond just transportation convenience — they also include key urban functions such as medical care, education, and shopping. This implies that the area possesses a comprehensive set of high-quality livability features.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通"" (transportation), ""医疗"" (healthcare), ""教育"" (education), ""购物"" (shopping) — all point to functional urban amenities.
- The rhetorical tone (""何止..."") suggests that these are important criteria for evaluating the desirability or quality of a local area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing amenities; they are implying that the presence of these functional advantages contributes to the area being perceived as a superior or more legitimate ""local"" space. This aligns with the idea of using functional livability as a standard to evaluate or define what constitutes a desirable or ""true"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and emphasizes the presence of comprehensive functional amenities as a key evaluative standard for local areas, going beyond mere preference to imply a standard of local area quality.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author uses the presence of multiple urban functions (transportation, healthcare, education, shopping) to evaluate and implicitly define what constitutes a high-quality or desirable ""local"" area.

乖乖，住城墙里头的是天龙人吗？讲话都这么吊了，其他都是乡下人哈哈哈,"RL1, RL4","  
The author uses sarcastic and mocking language (""天龙人"" [privileged elites], ""讲话都这么吊了"" [talk so arrogantly], ""乡下人"" [country bumpkins]) to express a critique of how people within the city walls behave as if they are superior, implying that there is a perceived cultural or linguistic boundary between ""city people"" and ""others."" The tone is humorous but also highlights a sense of exclusion based on perceived speech or cultural attitude.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住城墙里头的"" (those living inside the city walls) – implies a spatial boundary.  
- ""讲话都这么吊了"" (talk so arrogantly) – suggests a linguistic or cultural distinction.  
- ""乡下人"" (country bumpkins) – marks a social and spatial outsider status.  
- Implicitly, there is a contrast between an in-group (those who are mockingly called 天龙人) and an out-group (乡下人), based on speech and spatial identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not necessarily endorsing the idea that people inside the walls are superior, but they are highlighting that **others are perceived or labeled as outsiders based on speech and spatial identity**. The mocking tone suggests criticism, but the underlying logic — that **speech patterns and spatial residence are markers of local identity** — is still present in the discourse.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is using sarcasm and not directly endorsing the superiority of ""city wall insiders,"" they **implicitly accept that speech and spatial identity are used in society to distinguish locals from non-locals**. This is a **cultural-linguistic** and **spatial** distinction that reflects how people are categorized in terms of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author implicitly accepts the social convention that people inside the city walls are perceived as ""real locals,"" while others are not.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The way people speak is used as a marker to distinguish insiders and outsiders.

按以前的行政区块，至少老下关、秦淮区城墙外的部分、雨花、建邺相当于城乡结合部，2000年以前仙林大学城那边还有不少农田的,RL1,"  
The author is reflecting on how certain areas—such as the outer parts of La Xiaguan, Qinhuai District, Yuhua, and Jianye—were historically perceived as urban-rural fringe zones based on past administrative divisions. They also mention that until the early 2000s, areas like the Xianlin University Town still had farmland, reinforcing the idea that administrative boundaries and their historical configurations shape perceptions of what is considered ""core urban"" versus ""peripheral"" or ""rural-like"" within the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of **""以前的行政区块"" (previous administrative divisions)**  
- Specific **district names and spatial descriptions** (老下关, 秦淮区城墙外, 雨花, 建邺)  
- Reference to **urban-rural integration characteristics** and farmland still existing in certain areas before 2000  
- Implies a **historical and socially accepted perception** of which areas were considered ""central"" and which were ""marginal"" or ""semi-rural""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **historical administrative divisions** as a framework to describe how people used to understand spatial boundaries within the city. These boundaries are not just legal or administrative—they reflect **long-standing social perceptions** about which parts of the city were ""urban"" and which were more ""rural"" or transitional. This supports a **socially habitual understanding of spatial categories**, not just a legal one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **historical administrative divisions and socially accepted spatial labels** are valid ways to understand and define local identity boundaries. They are not critiquing or resisting this logic, but rather presenting it as a common-sense framework.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is relying on **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perceptions** of spatial categories—rooted in past administrative divisions—to define or understand the **symbolic and identity-based boundaries** of what counts as ""urban"" or ""local"" within the city.

Output: RL1"
以前城墙以内，现在按行政区划。如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了，太小。现在南京全部加一起也不大，再减就没啦,RL2,"  
The author is discussing how the definition of ""local"" in Nanjing has evolved—from being based on the old walled city to being based on current administrative divisions. They argue that if Nanjing were still defined only by the old walled area, it would be too small to represent the city's current scale and identity. The author supports the idea that administrative legitimacy, rather than historical spatial boundaries, should define who is considered ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前城墙以内"" (within the old city walls) — refers to historical spatial boundaries.  
- ""现在按行政区划"" (now according to administrative divisions) — indicates a shift to administrative legitimacy.  
- ""If still according to before"" — implies a rejection of the old spatial understanding.  
- ""南京全部加一起也不大"" — suggests that the city's identity now includes a broader area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author contrasts two ways of defining the ""local"" identity of Nanjing residents: one based on historical spatial cognition (RL1) and the other based on current administrative boundaries (RL2). The author clearly endorses the administrative approach and implicitly rejects the historical one as outdated and too restrictive.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** as the correct standard for defining ""local"" identity in Nanjing and implicitly rejects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2** because the author explicitly supports using current administrative divisions (rather than historical ones) to define the scope of local identity.

Output: RL2"
城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,RL1,"  
The author recalls growing up outside the city wall and refers to going to **Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple)** as ""entering the city."" This implies a habitual, socially shared perception of spatial boundaries — where being ""inside the wall"" is symbolically associated with the core urban area, and being ""outside"" is seen as peripheral or non-core. This reflects a **socially constructed spatial cognition** that defines who is ""local"" based on perceived urban centrality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""城墙外"" (outside the city wall): a spatial designation indicating a perceived boundary.
- ""去夫子庙都说进城了"" (going to Fuzimiao is referred to as ""entering the city""): indicates a symbolic boundary between ""inside"" and ""outside"" the city.
- The author’s childhood experience of growing up ""outside"" but recognizing ""inside"" as the symbolic city center reflects **habitual, culturally sedimented spatial cognition**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts and expresses a **shared, habitual understanding** of the city center as symbolically distinct from its periphery. This spatial cognition is not administrative or economic but symbolic and socially sedimented — using the wall and Fuzimiao as landmarks to define what ""counts"" as the city or the local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses a **socially habitual perception of urban spatial boundaries**, using them to define what it means to ""enter the city"" — thus distinguishing between ""local"" (inside) and ""non-local"" or peripheral (outside).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses a **shared, habitual, and symbolic spatial cognition** (e.g., ""entering the city"") to distinguish between core and peripheral areas, which functions as a standard for local identity.

Output: RL1"
以前交通不发达 所以才觉得城墙内才是主城区 比如过去的白下区的同学就很少去下关区 因为远,RL1,"  
The author is reflecting on how historical transportation limitations shaped people's perceptions of urban spatial boundaries — specifically, that only the inner-city area within the city walls was considered the ""main city,"" while areas like Xiaguan were seen as distant and less central. This indicates a **socially shared spatial认知** that has changed over time due to infrastructure development.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前交通不发达"" (in the past transportation was underdeveloped) — background context.  
- ""城墙内才是主城区"" (only within the city walls was considered the main urban area) — a symbolic spatial perception.  
- ""白下区的同学很少去下关区"" (students from Baixia District rarely went to Xiaguan District) — reflects habitual spatial behavior and social perception of distance.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not expressing a current belief in these boundaries, but rather explaining how **habitual or historically sedimented perceptions of space** (e.g., which areas are considered ""core"" or ""peripheral"") were shaped by past transportation limitations. These perceptions reflect **collective emotional or cognitive maps** of the city rather than formal administrative or functional distinctions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **people used to define ""local"" or ""main city"" identity based on habitual spatial cognition rooted in historical conditions**, even if they no longer do so. This reflects an understanding of **vernacular spatial authority**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it describes how **shared, habitual, and historically rooted perceptions of intra-city spatial boundaries** were used to define what counts as the ""main city"" and who counts as ""local.""

Output: RL1"
确实，小时候我们家住城南现在万象城那边他们都觉得瑞金路解放门好远了，就是城墙城南到城墙城东觉得好远啊那时候交通实在不便利,RL1,"  
The author is reflecting on how, during their childhood, people perceived spatial distances differently due to inconvenient transportation. Specifically, areas like **Ruijin Road** and **Jiefang Gate**, though relatively close in modern terms, were seen as far away from **Chengnan (City South)** and the **City East**. This reflects a **historical perception of intra-city spatial boundaries** shaped by both physical infrastructure and social cognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of **specific intra-city locations**: “Chengnan” (城南), “Ruijin Road” (瑞金路), “Jiefang Gate” (解放门), “City East” (城东), “Wall” (城墙), and “Wanxiang City” (万象城).  
- Reference to **spatial perception**: “felt so far away” (好远了), indicating a **subjective rather than administrative or physical** sense of distance.  
- **Transportation limitations** (""traffic was inconvenient"", 交通实在不便利) as a contextual factor shaping **habitual spatial cognition**, not as a standalone standard for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not emphasizing administrative boundaries, family history, language, or economic factors. Instead, they are recalling how **social perceptions of space** were shaped by historical transportation conditions and how these perceptions defined **which areas were seen as “close” or “far”** in a local context. This reflects **habitual, socially shared understandings of intra-city geography** that influence how people identify with or differentiate parts of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly conveys that **local people have shared, habitual spatial perceptions**—for example, that certain areas (like Ruijin Road and Jiefang Gate) were “far” from Chengnan and City East—based on past social and infrastructural conditions. These perceptions are not administrative or functional but **symbolic and habitual**, used to define **local spatial identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author uses **shared, habitual spatial perceptions** (e.g., what areas feel “far” or “close”) as part of the **local cognitive map** that informs **intra-city identity distinctions**.

Output: RL1"
nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,RL1,"  
The author humorously or self-deprecatingly describes their own area — **Jianning (建邺)** — as ""the countryside"" (乡下), and emphasizes that entering the city center involves physically crossing a river, a bridge, and even passing through city walls. This reflects a **spatial perception** and **identity boundary** based on **habitual, symbolic understandings of urban geography**, rather than administrative or functional distinctions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""建邺是乡下"" (""Jianning is the countryside"") — directly assigns a symbolic spatial identity to the area.
- ""进城要过河过桥进城墙"" (""To go to the city, you have to cross a river, a bridge, and the city wall"") — reinforces a **symbolic boundary** between ""here"" and ""there,"" using historical or traditional spatial markers.
- The use of the word **""进城""** (""entering the city"") implies that the speaker's area is **not considered part of the core city**, even if it may be administratively included.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing geography; they are expressing a **socially shared perception** of spatial identity — that Jianning is symbolically ""outside"" the city, despite being part of it administratively. This reflects a **vernacular understanding of urban space**, where symbolic and habitual markers (rivers, walls, bridges) define what is ""central"" and what is ""peripheral” — who is “local” to the city proper and who is not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and expresses a **spatial identity boundary** based on **habitual, symbolic, and historically rooted perceptions of the city**, not administrative or functional criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is using **shared, symbolic, and habitual understandings of urban space** — such as rivers, walls, and the phrase ""进城"" — to define who or what counts as ""local"" or ""central"" to the city.

Output: RL1"
小时候家里人都以城墙为界，城墙外都是郊区,RL1,"  
The author recalls that during their childhood, family members used the city wall as a symbolic boundary to distinguish between the urban core and the suburbs. This reflects a habitual, shared perception of spatial categories that goes beyond administrative boundaries and is based on long-standing social cognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以城墙为界"" (using the city wall as a boundary) indicates a symbolic spatial demarcation.
- ""城墙外都是郊区"" (outside the wall are all suburbs) shows a socially accepted cognitive map that assigns different identity or status meanings to different areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The city wall is not just a physical structure but a symbolic marker of local identity. The author implies that inside the wall is the ""true"" local area, while outside is peripheral or less central to local identity. This reflects a collective, habitual way of understanding urban space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly conveys the idea that the city wall serves as a socially recognized boundary shaping local identity, rooted in tradition and shared understanding.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses a historically and socially sedimented spatial boundary — the city wall — to define local identity and differentiate between core and peripheral areas.

Output: RL1"
跟钱有什么关系？ta说的主城区是历史沿革，优越感来自于底蕴，有底蕴不等于有钱，扯上海人做什么,RL1,"  
The author is refuting the idea that economic factors (e.g., wealth) are central to defining ""local people"" identity. Instead, they argue that the concept of ""main urban area"" is rooted in historical evolution and cultural depth (""底蕴""), and that the sense of superiority associated with it comes from this historical and cultural foundation—not from economic status. They also reject linking this identity to specific groups like ""Shanghainese,"" suggesting that doing so misrepresents the basis of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""主城区"" (main urban area): Indicates a spatial concept that is historically rooted.  
- ""历史沿革"" (historical evolution): Points to a long-standing, socially sedimented understanding of space.  
- ""优越感来自于底蕴"" (superiority comes from cultural depth): Suggests that identity is tied to historical and cultural legitimacy, not material or economic factors.  
- ""有底蕴不等于有钱"" (having cultural depth does not equal being wealthy): Explicitly rejects economic explanations.  
- ""扯上海人做什么"" (what does being a Shanghainese have to do with it): Rejects the idea of linking identity to administrative or regional stereotypes, especially those associated with economic or elite status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly defines local identity in terms of historical and cultural legitimacy tied to specific urban spaces (""main urban area""), rejecting both economic explanations (RL5/RL6) and narrow administrative or stereotypical identities (RL2/RL7). The emphasis is on a socially shared, historically sedimented understanding of where ""true locals"" belong, which aligns with a vernacular spatial framework.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that local identity is rooted in historical and cultural understandings of space (""main urban area"" defined by historical evolution), not in economic, administrative, or occupational categories.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author defines ""local people"" identity based on a shared, historically sedimented perception of urban space that carries symbolic and evaluative meaning.

Output: RL1"
肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心,None,"  
The author expresses a positive emotional attachment to the area of Xianlin, even humorously referring to it as ""the center of the universe."" They also mention that it is convenient, indicating a favorable evaluation of its livability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""肯定便利啊"" (Of course it's convenient) refers to functional convenience and livability.  
- ""仙林是宇宙的中心"" (Xianlin is the center of the universe) reflects an emotional or symbolic attachment to the area, possibly implying a sense of local pride or identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is expressing a subjective, positive opinion about Xianlin, emphasizing both its convenience and its symbolic centrality in their personal or local worldview. However, there is **no explicit or implicit judgment about who counts as ""local""** or what defines ""local identity"" — the statement remains at the level of personal affection and area evaluation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
While the text contains elements related to RL5 (Functional Livability) — such as mentioning convenience — it does **not** link this to a standard for defining ""local identity"" or distinguishing locals from non-locals. Similarly, the phrase ""center of the universe"" is metaphorical and does not imply a shared or habitual spatial认知 (RL1) used to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
There is **no clear endorsement of any standard** used by the author to define ""local identity."" The text remains an expression of personal affection and convenience without engaging in boundary-making or identity-definition logic.

Output: None"
什么时候方言成为决定是否是主城区的标准了？,N/A,"  
The author is questioning the logic or legitimacy of using dialect as a standard to determine whether someone belongs to the ""main urban area"" or is considered ""local."" The rhetorical tone suggests skepticism or criticism toward such a practice, rather than endorsement.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""方言"" (dialect) is clearly mentioned as a potential standard.
- ""决定是否是主城区"" (""decides whether one is part of the main urban area"") links dialect to a boundary marker for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author does **not** endorse dialect as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they are questioning or resisting its use in this context. According to the annotation guidelines, **criteria that the author explicitly resists or negates should not be annotated**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse the use of dialect as a standard for defining ""local"" identity; rather, they are critiquing or questioning it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author is not endorsing the use of dialect (or any other standard) to define local identity, and is instead challenging the logic behind such a criterion, **no RL category applies**.

Output:"
行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,(no label),"  
The author is challenging the validity of using **administrative boundaries** to define ""local identity."" They point out that although栖霞 (Qixia) is administratively part of the main urban area, its boundary extends close to 句容 (Jurong), a different region. The author then asserts that **""local people never look at this""**, explicitly rejecting administrative legitimacy as a meaningful standard for defining who is ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""行政上栖霞也是主城区"" (Administratively, Qixia is also part of the main city) → relates to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.  
- ""本地人从来不看这个"" (Local people never look at this) → explicitly **rejects** the use of administrative boundaries for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the mismatch between administrative designation and perceived local identity to **discredit administrative legitimacy** as a valid criterion. The argument is not about endorsing any specific RL category, but rather about **rejecting RL2**. Since the annotation task only includes **endorsed** criteria, and this author clearly **does not endorse** administrative division as a valid standard, it should **not** be annotated.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly rejects** RL2. There is **no endorsement** of any other standard for defining local identity (e.g., no mention of language, family roots, cultural habits, etc.).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **rejects** the only potentially relevant RL category (RL2) and does **not endorse** any other RL criteria, **no RL label applies**.

The author is evaluating Nanjing's urban structure and public perception, particularly how the city's ""core"" is still associated with the old city, while new districts like Jiangbei (Pukou) and Hexi are not well known to outsiders. The author also comments on the city’s infrastructure (tunnels vs. elevated roads) and street aesthetics, suggesting that the visibility and recognition of a district influence how ""local"" or urban it is perceived to be. The comparison with Qianjiang Century City (in Hangzhou) and Pudong (in Shanghai) further implies that a district's symbolic and spatial identity affects its legitimacy in the broader urban imagination.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""Core still in the old city"" – indicates a spatial perception of centrality.
- ""New districts not known to outsiders"" – implies a lack of symbolic recognition.
- ""Outsiders won't go to Jiangbei or Hexi except for concerts"" – spatial behavior linked to perception.
- Comparison to Qianjiang Century City and Pudong – symbolic recognition and urban identity benchmarks.
- ""Walking along Jiangdong Road, Jiangbei Avenue, Shuanglong Avenue doesn’t feel bad"" – suggests positive spatial experience, countering negative perceptions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is not explicitly defining who is a ""local person"" but is instead evaluating the spatial and symbolic structure of Nanjing, particularly how the old city continues to represent the city's identity while new districts remain peripheral in both perception and function. This reflects a habitual spatial cognition and emotional mapping of the city’s areas, especially in contrast to how other cities (like Shanghai or Hangzhou) have successfully redefined their urban cores.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author implicitly endorses the idea that urban areas are recognized or not based on shared, habitual perceptions and that the ""core"" of Nanjing is still symbolically and socially tied to the old city. This reflects a **socially shared emotional and symbolic map** of the city, which is central to RL1.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author discusses the city's spatial identity through shared perceptions, habitual understandings, and symbolic meanings assigned to different areas, particularly the contrast between the old city and new districts.

从大胜关高铁过江这个角度可以看到河西skyline,N/A,"  
The author is describing a physical view — the skyline of Hexi — that is visible from a specific vantage point (crossing the river via the Dashengguan high-speed rail). There is no mention of identity, belonging, or criteria for defining ""local people."" The statement is purely observational and spatially descriptive.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions a specific location (""大胜关高铁,"" ""河西"").
- Describes a visual experience (seeing the skyline).
- No mention of identity, belonging, or evaluative standards regarding who is or isn't ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument or stance regarding ""local identity."" The statement is a neutral observation about geography and visual perception, not about how people define themselves or others in relation to place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
No RL criteria are endorsed or used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity."" The text does not engage with the concept of local belonging or any of the RL-based standards.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not engage with the definition of ""local identity"" or use any of the RL criteria in that context, no RL category applies.

Output:"
高楼大厦就叫城建了？交通,RL5,"  
The author appears to be questioning or expressing skepticism about the idea that ""high-rise buildings alone constitute urban development"" (""高楼大厦就叫城建了？""), possibly implying that urban identity or ""local"" development involves more than just physical infrastructure. The second word ""交通"" (transportation) suggests that the author believes transportation infrastructure is also a necessary component of what constitutes a truly developed or ""urban"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""高楼大厦"" (high-rise buildings) refers to urban appearance or built environment.  
- ""城建"" (urban construction/development) implies a standard or definition of what constitutes an urban/local area.  
- ""交通"" (transportation) introduces another dimension of urban functionality or livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is critiquing a narrow definition of urban identity based only on visual markers like high-rises and is suggesting that more functional aspects like transportation are also essential. While this does not directly define ""local people,"" it implies that the author believes a place must meet certain **functional livability standards** (including both infrastructure and transportation) to be considered a legitimate or desirable ""local"" urban space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly define who is or isn't a ""local person,"" they are clearly endorsing a broader, more functional understanding of what constitutes a ""true"" or ""developed"" local urban area — one that goes beyond just the presence of high-rises to include transportation infrastructure. This functional perspective is used to evaluate the **quality or legitimacy of a local area**, which is relevant to the definition of ""local identity"" in spatial and environmental terms.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author is evaluating what counts as a legitimate or developed urban area based on its infrastructure and transportation — standards that are often used to define the desirability or authenticity of a ""local"" space.

Output: RL5"
哈哈哈有口音哥还行,RL4,"  
The author uses a casual, humorous tone (""哈哈哈"") to acknowledge their own or someone else's accent (""有口音哥还行""). This implies a recognition of linguistic difference, but with a relatively tolerant or light-hearted attitude toward it.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有口音"" (has an accent) directly relates to linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The tone suggests that although an accent exists, it's still acceptable — indicating an implicit standard of ""local speech"" against which the accent is judged.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The mention of accent serves as a boundary marker for local identity. Even though the author does not harshly judge the accent, they still recognize it as a distinguishable feature — implying that accent plays a role in how ""local"" someone sounds or is perceived to be.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly acknowledges that accent (and by extension, linguistic-cultural recognition) plays a role in defining or recognizing ""local people"" identity, even if they are not rigid about it.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4, as it reflects the use of linguistic features (accent) as a marker for identifying local or non-local identity, even if the speaker adopts a relaxed or humorous stance toward it.

我基本就是在海淀朝阳丰台活动，比较宅，从我家去公司也是走四环或者三环,N/A,"  
The author is describing their daily activity range (Haidian, Chaoyang, Fengtai) and commuting behavior (using the Fourth or Third Ring Road to go to work), while also implying a relatively ""local"" lifestyle centered around home and work. However, there is **no explicit or implicit endorsement of a standard for defining who is or isn't ""local""**—the author is merely describing their own behavior and habits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific districts: Haidian, Chaoyang, Fengtai.  
- Reference to commuting via the Third/Fourth Ring Road, indicating habitual movement within certain urban areas.  
- Self-description as ""宅 (zha)"" — relatively homebound — suggesting limited mobility beyond familiar zones.  
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, language, cultural habits, property, or occupation as a basis for defining ""local"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument** being made about who counts as local or what defines local identity. The author is not evaluating or asserting criteria for ""localness."" They are simply describing their own spatial behavior and routine.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does **not make any evaluative statement** or endorse any standard for defining ""local identity,"" **no RL category applies.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
None of the RL categories apply because the text does not present any logic or criteria the author uses to define ""local identity."" It only describes personal behavior and spatial habits.

Output:"
礼贤拆迁户,RL6,"  
The phrase ""礼贤拆迁户"" (Li Xian demolition household) refers to families displaced due to urban redevelopment. While the text is short, it implies a social distinction — those who were originally from the area (and thus had homes that were later demolished) versus those who moved in after redevelopment. This often carries symbolic meaning in terms of local legitimacy and social standing.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""拆迁户"" (demolition household) implies long-standing local residence that was affected by urban development.
- This status often comes with certain rights, compensation, or social recognition.
- It suggests a form of **social rootedness**, where being a demolition household signifies historical connection to the area.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the text is brief, the label ""拆迁户"" functions as a marker of prior local belonging and continuity. In many local contexts, being a demolition household is treated as evidence of being a ""true local"" or at least having legitimate historical ties to the area, which can influence social perception and status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The term is used without negation and implies recognition of a category that carries symbolic weight in local identity — specifically, that being a demolition household reflects a form of local historical presence and embeddedness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as it reflects a form of symbolic belonging based on historical residence, embedded rights, and local change. The demolition household status implies a deep-rooted connection to the area and is often used as a criterion for evaluating local legitimacy.

The author is expressing frustration and challenging the logic of someone else's generalization. They are using rhetorical questions to point out flawed reasoning — specifically, that a negative personal experience (e.g., receiving sour fruit or being served a poorly cooked dish) should not lead to a broad negative judgment (e.g., that all local people are unfriendly or that all dishes of a certain type are bad).  

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The text contains no explicit references to geography, administrative boundaries, family history, language, livability, social networks, or occupation.
- It is focused on reasoning, logic, and critique of generalization rather than identity or spatial categorization.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There are no RL elements present in the text. The author is not defining or evaluating ""local identity"" based on any of the RL criteria. Instead, they are critiquing faulty logic or overgeneralization in reasoning, possibly in response to a stereotype or personal grievance, but without endorsing or implying any specific standard for defining ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
No criteria related to the definition of ""local identity"" are endorsed or even implied. The text is focused on reasoning and argumentation, not on identity boundaries or local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does not engage with or endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity,"" none of the RL categories apply.

The author presents a subjective, emotionally charged, and habit-based perception of Beijing’s various districts, assigning symbolic meanings, cultural associations, and identity markers to each. The tone is informal and personal, yet it reflects a shared or at least individually internalized spatial cognition system. The descriptions imply a mental map of the city where each district has its own symbolic identity, often based on historical function, cultural stereotype, or habitual perception rather than administrative or economic criteria.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- District-specific symbolic labels: e.g., “East City: Art Museum, concentrated camp of Beijing historical sites,” “Haidian: computer repair, university camp,” “Chaoyang: my home, so big,” “Tongzhou: used to be Tong County,” “Shunyi:温泉 (hot spring), elementary school used to go there for picking gardens.”
- Cultural or historical associations: e.g., “Nanluoguxiang called China’s Akihabara (秋叶原),” “Tongzhou: Universal Studios.”
- Spatial perception and emotional distance: e.g., “Fangshan: so far……………………,” “Mentougou: so far……………………,” “Yanqing: only seen on weather forecast.”
- Identity markers: e.g., “Xicheng: academic camp,” “Haidian: computer repair,” “Huairou, Pinggu, Miyun: speak with accents, never been there.”

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The entire text functions as a personal, yet culturally resonant, spatial identity map. The author does not explicitly define who is “local,” but they do assign symbolic, historical, and habitual meanings to each area, implying that certain areas are more central or familiar (e.g., Chaoyang: “my home”), while others are peripheral or stereotyped (e.g., Mentougou: “so far”). These are not based on administrative boundaries, economic status, or linguistic criteria, but rather on shared or personal cultural perceptions of space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a **socially habitual, symbolic, and historical perception of spatial identity**. They use these habitual spatial labels to define how they perceive and categorize different areas of Beijing, which indirectly shapes who they might consider “local” based on familiarity or symbolic belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects the author’s use of shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories to define and symbolically distinguish areas of Beijing, often with cultural shorthand or emotional resonance.

密云，有密云水库，还有一些纪念馆，但是，交通就不太方便，就只有公交，你要是说北京应该就有地铁，说实话，我现在没见过只有公交，而且在镇上，你要去哪哪的也不方便，比如我要去快递驿站，我要骑一个小时的自行车才能去，骑回来，还要再一个小时其他的地方我就不知道了,RL5,"  
The author is describing their personal experience living in **Mi Yun (密云)**, highlighting the **lack of convenient transportation** (only buses, no subways), and the **inconvenience of daily life**—such as having to bike for an hour to reach a快递驿站 (express delivery station). While the area has some **natural and memorial resources (密云水库,纪念馆)**, the author is clearly **emphasizing the low functional convenience and poor environmental quality** of the area compared to what they consider a more ""standard"" or desirable urban living environment like Beijing proper.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Traffic is not very convenient, only buses""  
- ""In other places in Beijing there should be subways""  
- ""You have to bike for an hour to go and come back""  
- ""I've never seen a place with only buses""  
- Mentions of **Mi Yun** as a specific location with **low accessibility and inconvenient infrastructure**

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **comparing Mi Yun with the core urban areas of Beijing**, implicitly suggesting that **Mi Yun lacks the functional infrastructure (e.g., subway access)** that defines a ""real city"" or desirable urban living space. This implies that the **absence of such infrastructure affects how the author perceives the ""local"" quality or urban identity of the area**, and possibly who they consider a ""true local"" (e.g., those who live in more connected urban centers).

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is clearly **endorsing the idea that functional convenience (transportation, accessibility)** is an important standard for evaluating the **quality of a local area** and distinguishing it from less developed or peripheral areas. This goes beyond a mere complaint about inconvenience—it reflects a **hierarchical view of urban space**, where areas with better infrastructure are seen as more ""genuinely local"" or urban.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author is using **transportation infrastructure and convenience of daily life** as a **standard to evaluate the quality of a local area**, and by implication, what kind of place ""counts"" as a desirable or authentic part of the city in terms of local identity.

The author is listing various districts in Beijing and associating each with specific symbolic characteristics—such as high housing prices, good schools, trendy people, food, or natural resources. These associations reflect **habitual, symbolic perceptions** of each area, functioning as a kind of **cultural shorthand** for distinguishing between districts and shaping local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of symbolic district identities: “房价贵” (expensive housing), “学校多 教育好” (many schools, good education), “潮人多” (trendy people), “好吃的挺多” (a lot of good food), “有钱人多” (many rich people), “北京后花园” (Beijing's backyard), “桃子” (peaches), “水库” (reservoir), “冰灯” (ice lanterns).  
- These are **not** administrative definitions, family roots, language, or occupation-based evaluations, but rather **habitual, cultural, or symbolic associations** with each area.  
- The author does not explicitly define who is or isn't a ""local"" based on hukou, ancestry, or language, but rather implies that people identify with or are associated with certain areas based on **shared symbolic meanings**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text functions as a kind of **cultural map** of Beijing, where each district is assigned a symbolic identity. These symbolic identities are used to **differentiate between areas** and, by implication, the people who live in them. This supports a **socially habitual understanding** of local identity based on **shared perceptions and cultural shorthand**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is not resisting or questioning these symbolic identities—they are presenting them as **common knowledge** or **shared understandings**. Therefore, they are implicitly endorsing the **habitual, symbolic, and culturally shared spatial perceptions** used to define local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects **shared, habitual, and culturally sedimented perceptions of intra-city spatial categories**, used as **symbolic shorthand** for assigning evaluative or identity-relevant labels in relation to ""local identity.""

The author contrasts suburban and urban life, describing the suburbs as having beautiful natural scenery, friendly people, and a slow pace of life, while the city is portrayed as fast-paced, crowded, and convenient with facilities like the metro. Although the author objectively describes the characteristics of both areas, **they do not explicitly or implicitly use these features to define or judge who is or is not a ""local person.""**

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""郊区"" (suburbs), ""市里"" (city center):** Mention of spatial division, but not used to define local identity.
- **""山好水好，人实在，生活节奏慢"" (good mountains and water, honest people, slow pace of life):** Descriptions of environmental and lifestyle qualities of the suburbs.
- **""玩的东西多，生活节奏快，有地铁"" (many entertainment options, fast pace of life, has subways):** Descriptions of urban functional livability.
- **""地铁里全是人肉味儿"" (subway full of body odor):** A humorous critique of urban living conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The text is essentially a **comparison of lifestyle preferences and environmental qualities**, not an argument about **who qualifies as a ""local"" or what defines a ""local"" area**. The author does not use these descriptions to **draw boundaries of local identity**, nor do they suggest that people from one area are more ""local"" than others based on these characteristics.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author does **not endorse or imply any standard** (such as administrative belonging, family roots, linguistic features, etc.) **to define local identity**.
- The text is **purely descriptive and evaluative of living environments**, not prescriptive about who is or is not a ""local person.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not propose or imply any **identity-defining criteria** related to ""local people,"" **no RL category applies**.

The author presents a vivid, emotionally colored mental map of Beijing's districts, assigning each a distinct symbolic identity based on personal experience, cultural associations, and shared social perceptions. This reflects a form of **socially habitual spatial cognition**, where different districts are symbolically categorized and differentiated in terms of identity and belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The text repeatedly references specific districts (东城, 西城, 海淀, 朝阳, etc.) and links them to distinct symbolic identities or experiences.
- Phrases like “胡同多多的，是真京爷” (many hutongs, truly Beijingers), “学的我想死” (studying so hard I want to die), “副中心，环球影城” (sub-center, Universal Studios), and “国际学校多有钱人多” (many international schools, many rich people) all reflect **socially sedimented perceptions** of these areas.
- The author implicitly endorses these spatial distinctions by organizing the entire text around them and assigning evaluative or symbolic meanings to each district.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these spatial associations to construct a **symbolic geography** of Beijing, where certain areas are imbued with specific cultural meanings that influence how people from or in those areas are perceived. This contributes to a **shared, habitual understanding** of who belongs where, reinforcing the idea that identity is tied to district-specific characteristics.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and organizes the narrative around **habitual, symbolic, and socially shared understandings of intra-city spatial categories**. These are not administrative boundaries or functional qualities per se, but **emotional and cultural maps** that define ""localness"" in different parts of the city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses culturally embedded, emotionally charged, and socially habitual spatial categorizations to define and symbolize local identity across different parts of Beijing.

The author is listing a series of symbolic, habitual, and culturally embedded perceptions of different Beijing districts. These descriptions reflect a shared or expected understanding of each area’s identity, often involving historical background, cultural symbolism, lifestyle stereotypes, or emotional associations. This reflects a **socially shared cognitive map** of Beijing’s internal spatial structure, going beyond administrative boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **皇城根儿 (imperial palace area), 正黄旗 (Bannermen identity)** – historical and symbolic spatial identity for Xicheng.  
- **旅游景点 (tourist spots), 全是人 (crowded)** – symbolic identity of Dongcheng.  
- **潮 (trendy)** – lifestyle and cultural identity marker for Chaoyang.  
- **全是学霸 (full of top students)** – educational and functional identity for Haidian.  
- **西瓜好吃 (good watermelons), 买花买鱼 (buying flowers and fish), 环球影城 (Universal Studios), 水库 (reservoir), 有口音 (accent), 空气好 (good air), 猿人遗址 (Peking Man Site), 发大水 (flood), etc. – all reflect stereotypical or habitual understandings of the symbolic or functional identity of each district.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not making a personal identity claim but is **presenting a shared, habitual, and symbolic perception** of Beijing’s internal spatial structure. These are not administrative divisions, family histories, or personal experiences, but rather **cultural shorthand** used to define how different districts are perceived and differentiated in terms of identity and belonging within the broader ""Beijing"" local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and presents a **socially shared, habitual, and symbolic understanding of spatial identity** – not just describing places, but implying that these are **commonly accepted ways of categorizing and identifying districts**, which function as **cognitive boundaries** for local identity.

The author provides a summary of different Beijing districts, primarily commenting on their housing characteristics, functional features (e.g., schools, scenic spots, commercial centers), and spatial perception (e.g., ""far away""). While the tone is descriptive and evaluative, the key point is that the author implicitly defines **which areas are more central or desirable**, and which are ""suburban"" or ""far away,"" thus forming a **hierarchical spatial perception** of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Spatial evaluation phrases** such as “好远” (so far), “郊区” (suburbs), and the contrast with central landmarks like “西单” (Xidan), “朝阳：潮人and有钱人” (Chaoyang: trendy and rich people), “好玩的商场挺多” (many fun malls) indicate a **habitual spatial cognition** of which areas are central and which are peripheral.
- The author **does not** use administrative boundaries, family rootedness, language, occupation, or direct social or economic indicators to define ""local"" identity.
- The **focus is on socially shared perceptions of space**, such as what areas are ""central,"" ""desirable,"" or ""suburban,"" and which ones people go to for specific functions (e.g., vacation, dancing exams, barbecues).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly constructs a **symbolic spatial map** of Beijing, where certain districts (e.g., Dongcheng, Xicheng, Haidian, Chaoyang) are seen as more central or prestigious, while others (e.g., Fengtai, Shijingshan, Mentougou, etc.) are considered peripheral or only visited for specific purposes. This reflects a **socially habitual, non-administrative understanding** of urban space that influences how people perceive ""local"" areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and implicitly uses **habitual, symbolic spatial distinctions** to define which areas are considered ""local"" or core parts of Beijing and which are not. There is no explicit endorsement of administrative boundaries, family history, linguistic markers, functional livability standards, economic assets, or occupational typification as the basis for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses **socially shared, habitual perceptions of space**—such as ""far away,"" ""suburban,"" or ""central and trendy""—to define which areas are considered part of the ""real"" or central Beijing and which are not.

老师我家怀柔也想要地铁,(no output),"  
The author expresses a desire for the ""Huairou"" area to have a subway, implying that the current lack of one is a deficiency. However, the statement is brief and does not directly define or evaluate ""local people"" identity, nor does it propose or endorse any standard for distinguishing who is or isn't local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Huairou"" is a place name, potentially related to spatial cognition or administrative belonging.  
- ""Subway"" is a functional infrastructure element, potentially related to livability and area quality.  
- However, the text does not make any evaluative claims about local identity, belonging, or standards for defining ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no clear evaluative or definitional argument about ""local identity"" in the text. The statement is a simple expression of desire for improved infrastructure, not a claim about who counts as ""local"" or what makes an area ""genuinely local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not propose or endorse any criteria for defining ""local people"" or evaluating local areas in terms of identity. The mention of subway development is about preference or need, not about symbolic boundary-drawing or identity definition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not present any standard or logic for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating local areas in that context, **no RL category applies.**

The author is presenting a **habitual, symbolic, and culturally shared perception** of Beijing’s various districts. Each district is assigned a brief label or stereotype—some positive, some neutral, some even dismissive. These labels reflect **collective identity markers** and **implicit spatial hierarchies** that the author endorses or at least reproduces as part of a shared local understanding of where ""meaning"" resides in the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Districts are described using **symbolic shorthand**: “城里人” (urbanites), “钢！” (steel industry identity), “天通苑” (a large residential complex), “荟聚” (a well-known IKEA shopping center), etc.
- These descriptions imply **habitual or stereotypical understandings** of each area.
- The author is not giving administrative definitions or personal experiences, but **socially shared labels** that reflect how areas are culturally recognized and differentiated.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just listing locations or describing them objectively. They are using **socially sedimented, symbolic labels** to represent how each district is perceived within the broader Beijing identity framework. This implies that **local identity is shaped not just by geography, but by shared cultural memory, stereotypes, and emotional maps**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author is clearly reproducing and endorsing **habitual, socially shared spatial perceptions** of Beijing’s districts. These are not administrative, linguistic, or economic markers, but **symbolic and cultural labels** that define the emotional or identity-based geography of the city.

The author is listing various Beijing districts and their associated landmarks, cultural symbols, or stereotypical impressions. Each district is linked to a specific image or identity marker—such as iconic places (e.g., Forbidden City, Nanluoguxiang), cultural or lifestyle traits (e.g., ""口音好重""), or symbolic representations (e.g., ""别墅 有钱的多""). These associations reflect a shared or habitual perception of spatial identity within Beijing, where each district carries a distinct symbolic meaning in the collective imagination.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- District names (东城, 西城, 海淀, etc.) are used as spatial units of identity.
- Each district is associated with symbolic or stereotypical characteristics (e.g., ""通州太爱吹牛逼"", ""平谷口音好重"", ""顺义别墅 有钱的多"").
- These associations are not administrative, legal, or based on personal rootedness, but rather reflect **habitual, culturally shared perceptions** of what each area represents.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these symbolic spatial associations to reflect a **shared, habitual, and culturally sedimented understanding of Beijing’s intra-city geography**. These are not just descriptions of places, but **identity markers** that define how people perceive and talk about different parts of the city in terms of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses and reproduces a **socially shared spatial identity system**, where each district has a culturally recognized symbolic meaning that contributes to the sense of ""localness"" or differentiation among Beijing locals.

The author is listing and evaluating various districts in Beijing, describing their symbolic meanings, spatial perceptions, and stereotypical characteristics. The descriptions reflect a habitual, socially shared understanding of where ""core"" or ""central"" Beijing is, and where the more ""peripheral"" or ""less local"" areas are. These perceptions are not based on administrative boundaries or individual attributes, but on collective emotional or cultural maps of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:

- These are not descriptions of administrative status, family roots, language, or economic function, but rather **habitual, culturally shared perceptions** of which parts of the city are ""really Beijing"" and which are not.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing geography — they are constructing a **cultural map** of Beijing that reflects **who belongs and where ""true locals"" are located**. The repeated emphasis on certain areas being ""偏"" or ""not really Beijing"" implies that there is a **shared understanding of spatial legitimacy** in defining who is considered a local Beijing person.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Each of the RL categories is represented in the author’s discourse:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The symbolic labeling of areas like 南城 (southern Beijing), 远郊 (remote suburbs), and 村 (villages) reflects **habitual, culturally embedded spatial perceptions** used to distinguish ""local"" from ""non-local"" areas.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The mention of ID card numbers (身份证号) in 朝阳 directly ties to **official administrative identity** as a marker of local belonging.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** Birthplace (东城), preschool years and grandparents’ home (西城) are used to **establish deep personal and familial ties** to the city, implying a rooted ""local"" identity.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The repeated mention of strong accents (口音很重) in areas like 房山, 密云, and 延庆 implies that **language and cultural difference** are markers of being ""non-local"" or peripheral.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability):** Environmental quality (water in 大兴, air in 昌平/延庆), housing prices (延庆), and convenience are used to **evaluate the desirability and symbolic status of areas**, which in turn affects how ""local"" they are perceived to be.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The emphasis on educational resources (海淀), social networks, and community ties implies that **integration into local systems and networks** is a standard for evaluating local identity.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The mention of IT workers in 海淀 and the business district in 朝阳 reflects **occupational symbolism** as a way to define the character and status of local areas.

The author is listing and describing various Beijing districts, offering informal, often stereotypical or commonly accepted impressions of each. These descriptions include historical identity (e.g., mergers), cultural associations (e.g., universities, accents), economic or occupational imagery (e.g., ""rich,"" ""good jobs""), and spatial perceptions (e.g., ""used to be suburban""). These are **shared or habitual understandings** of the districts, often reflecting **symbolic meanings or social categorizations** that go beyond administrative facts.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Historical/identity changes:** ""Chongwen & Dongcheng merged,"" ""Xuanwu & Xicheng merged"" — implies a shared historical or social identity.  
- **Cultural stereotypes and symbolic meanings:**  
  - ""Haidian: many universities,"" ""Chaoyang: seems rich,"" ""Fengtai: used to be suburban,"" ""Shunyi:农家乐很多 (many rural resorts)"" — these are **cultural or social shorthand** for what each area represents.  
  - ""Pinggu: big peaches, has a local accent"" — combines **cultural-linguistic** and symbolic rural identity.  
- **Spatial perception:** ""Chengyuan (city people),"" ""Fengtai: used to be suburban,"" ""Changping: too far north"" — reflect **habitual or social spatial cognition** of what is ""central"" or ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not offering a formal or administrative breakdown, but rather a **socially shared map** of Beijing — one that reflects **habitual, symbolic, and historically sedimented understandings** of where different identities and lifestyles are located. These are **cultural shorthand** used to understand and communicate the **symbolic geography** of Beijing, not just physical or administrative facts.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not explicitly define who is or isn't a local person**, nor do they explicitly judge or exclude people based on these descriptions. However, the **descriptions themselves reflect widely accepted or habitual understandings of urban space**, which **function as symbolic markers** of local identity.  
The text **implies** that these **habitual spatial perceptions and symbolic meanings** are part of how people **cognitively organize and understand local identity** in Beijing.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text best matches **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because it reflects **habitual, socially shared understandings of intra-city spatial categories**, often rooted in historical or symbolic meanings, and used as **cultural shorthand** for local identity and belonging.

The author is sharing a conversation they overheard between an elderly person and others about historical conceptions of Beijing’s urban and suburban areas. The elderly person distinguishes between ""老北京"" (old Beijing) locals who identify with the original core urban districts (城八区), and those from areas that were later incorporated into Beijing (like the far suburbs). The author also supports this view by providing historical administrative changes to back up the idea that certain areas were ""not originally part of Beijing"" and are perceived as distant or peripheral.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""老北京的城八区"" (the original eight urban districts of old Beijing):** Refers to the historical, socially accepted understanding of which areas are considered the ""true"" or ""core"" local areas.  
- **""城里"" (the city proper) vs. ""近郊"" (near suburbs) vs. ""远郊"" (far suburbs):** Clear distinctions based on a habitual, socially shared perception of spatial hierarchy and local belonging.  
- **""后划进来的"" (later incorporated):** Refers to areas administratively added to Beijing but not traditionally seen as part of the local core.  
- **Historical references to Beijing's administrative divisions before and after 1949:** Used to support the idea that some areas are more authentically ""local"" than others.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the elderly person’s narrative and corroborates it with historical facts to reinforce a **socially habitual and historically rooted understanding of which areas ""count"" as truly local**. This supports a **symbolic and spatial hierarchy of local identity**, where being from the original urban core is seen as more authentically ""Beijing"" than being from areas that were later incorporated.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and validates the **socially shared spatial perception** that distinguishes between the ""true local"" urban core and later-added suburban or peripheral areas. This is not just administrative history—it's used to **construct a standard of local identity** based on spatial belonging and historical rootedness.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text strongly aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perception** of which areas are considered the core of ""local"" identity in Beijing, and which are seen as peripheral or newly incorporated and thus less authentically ""local.""

The author is strongly asserting their local identity as a Fangshan person and is defending a specific understanding of Beijing’s local identity based on historical and administrative changes. They emphasize that certain areas (like Yanqing) were once part of Hebei and thus have different characteristics (e.g., heavier accents), while others (like Fangshan) have always been “Beijing’s inherent territory.” The author uses historical records (like county annals) and administrative legitimacy to define what makes someone truly “local” to Beijing.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""Fangshan person""**, **""Yanqing""**, **""Hebei""**, **""Beijing""** — references to specific regions and their historical-administrative affiliations.
- **""County annals""** — implies reliance on historical documentation to support claims about local identity.
- **""Because of some reasons, it was placed under Hebei’s administration temporarily""**, **""河北就管了几年，然后又划回来了""** — references to administrative changes over time.
- **""Why Yanqing has a heavy accent""** — links accent (linguistic-cultural recognition) to historical-administrative background.
- **""You should know what 'temporary' means""** — emphasizes the non-permanence of certain administrative statuses.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is constructing a layered argument:
- **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2):** They argue that true “Beijing local” identity depends on whether a region was historically and continuously under Beijing’s administration (vs. being temporarily under Hebei).
- **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1):** They also imply a social perception that some areas (like Yanqing) are “less local” to Beijing due to their history and cultural markers (like accent), while others (like Fangshan) are core “native” areas.
- **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4):** The author links the heavier accent in Yanqing to its historical administrative background, implying that accent reflects deeper questions of local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
All three elements — administrative continuity (RL2), historical-spatial perception (RL1), and linguistic-cultural traits (RL4) — are **explicitly used by the author** to define who is “truly local” to Beijing and who is not. The author is not merely describing historical facts or linguistic differences; they are using these to **construct a boundary of local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author uses historical and social perceptions of which areas have always “belonged” to Beijing to define local identity.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author explicitly uses administrative history — temporary vs. permanent affiliation — as a core criterion for defining who counts as a “true” local.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author links Yanqing’s accent to its outsider status, implying that speech patterns are a marker of local identity.

The author is pushing back against what they perceive as outdated or narrow views of Beijing’s spatial identity. They argue that **all 16 districts of Beijing**—including both the core ""city six districts"" (东西海朝石丰) and the 10 suburban districts—should be considered part of Beijing. They also refute the idea that areas beyond the Third Ring Road are still ""rural,"" emphasizing that even areas within the Sixth Ring are now well-developed and integral to the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""思想别那么传统 / 封建"" (Don’t be so traditional/feudal) — implies disagreement with old ways of spatial thinking.
- ""北京16个区，一个区也不能少"" (All 16 districts of Beijing must be included) — indicates a broad, inclusive view of Beijing’s spatial identity.
- ""六环里，现在六环建设也不差啊"" (Even the Sixth Ring is well-developed now) — reflects updated perceptions of urban development.
- ""城六区...郊区...一个也不能少"" (City six districts and the 10 suburbs, none can be missing) — clearly divides and includes different spatial categories as part of the whole ""Beijing"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **redefining or expanding the spatial cognition of what counts as “Beijing”** in terms of local identity. They reject traditional or narrow views (such as equating ""Beijing"" only with the urban core or the Third Ring), and instead advocate for a broader, more inclusive understanding of Beijing’s territory as a unified local identity. This is not about administrative boundaries per se, but about **shared or evolving social perception of which areas “count” as part of the local city identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a **new or evolving collective spatial perception** of Beijing that includes both traditional urban and suburban areas. They reject the idea that only certain areas are “real” Beijing, and instead promote a **shared, updated vernacular understanding** of Beijing’s spatial identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is advocating for a **shared, socially constructed understanding of which areas “count” as part of the local city identity**, rejecting outdated or narrow views and promoting a broader, inclusive perception of Beijing’s spatial identity.

The author is correcting a historical narrative, emphasizing the administrative and spatial evolution of Beijing. They argue that modern Beijing originates from the Ming dynasty, not the Jin dynasty, and that its administrative boundaries were significantly altered during the Republican era (especially in 1928), with gradual restoration after建国 (the founding of the PRC). The author clearly distinguishes between historical periods and insists on a specific administrative and spatial legitimacy for defining what ""counts"" as Beijing or its local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- Rejection of Jin dynasty as relevant to modern Beijing (""金国北京和现在北京没用一点关系"")
- Emphasis on Ming dynasty as the beginning of modern Beijing (""现在北京始于明代"")
- Discussion of administrative boundary changes, especially in 1928 and post-1949, including being ""直辖"" (placed directly under central government) and ""划给河北"" (transferred to Hebei)
- Reference to 1958 as the formation of today’s Beijing
- Mention of 民国 (Republican era), 肢解 (fragmentation), 划给 (transferred to), 留住 (retain), 直辖 (directly administered), etc., all indicating a strong focus on administrative legitimacy and historical transformation

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses historical and administrative changes—especially the reorganization of Beijing’s jurisdictional boundaries during the Republican era and after 1949—as the basis for asserting what constitutes the ""real"" or ""legitimate"" Beijing in terms of local identity. They explicitly reject the idea that the Jin dynasty has any relevance to modern Beijing’s local identity, instead anchoring it in Ming origins and post-1949 administrative consolidation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining what counts as Beijing and, by implication, who counts as a ""local"" in that space. They reject historical continuity from earlier dynasties (e.g., Jin), instead grounding legitimacy in Ming-era formation and post-1949 administrative restoration.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects the **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** category, as the author uses jurisdictional history and administrative boundary changes to define the scope and authenticity of ""local"" Beijing identity.

82年生人，小时候东西城是北京城，崇文宣武是城里破落户，朝海丰是近郊，其他都是远郊县城，二环是城乡分界线，三环就是荒地了。,RL1,"  
The author is describing a historically sedimented, socially conventional spatial认知 of Beijing from their childhood experience — specifically how different districts and ring roads were symbolically categorized in terms of urban identity. This reflects a shared emotional and symbolic mapping of urban space that defines who is considered ""central"" or ""local"" within Beijing’s urban fabric.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""东西城是北京城"" (Dongcheng and Xicheng are *the* Beijing) implies a core urban identity.  
- ""崇文宣武是城里破落户"" (Chongwen and Xuanwu are rundown urban areas) suggests a secondary or degraded urban identity.  
- ""朝海丰是近郊"" (Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai are suburbs) indicates a spatial hierarchy.  
- ""二环是城乡分界线"" (the Second Ring Road is the urban-rural boundary) and ""三环就是荒地"" (the Third Ring Road is wilderness) demarcate symbolic spatial boundaries.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not describing administrative boundaries or personal preferences, but rather a habitual, symbolic spatial认知 shared among Beijing residents — a kind of emotional or cultural map that defines who or where is considered ""truly Beijing"" versus peripheral. This is used to express a conventional understanding of which areas ""count"" as the city core and thus are associated with authentic local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses this spatial认知 as a legitimate or commonly accepted way of understanding local identity in Beijing — it is not something they are critiquing or merely describing as used by others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is expressing a shared, habitual, and historically rooted perception of intra-city spatial categories that define who or where is considered central or peripheral to the local identity of Beijing.

对 小时候管去东西城天安门叫进北京城，出去了就都叫郊区，这么一看北京发展还是挺快的，怪不得国外都以为中国还是农村,RL1,"  
The author is reflecting on how Beijing has expanded significantly over time. They mention that in the past, going to the Dongcheng or Xicheng districts or Tiananmen was considered ""entering Beijing,"" while areas outside were called suburbs. Now, by comparison, the city has grown so much that foreigners might still think China is largely rural. This expresses a perception of spatial identity based on historical and evolving social understandings of what constitutes the ""core"" of the city versus the periphery.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""管去东西城天安门叫进北京城"" (called going to Dongcheng/Xicheng/Tiananmen 'entering Beijing') reflects a historically sedimented, socially shared understanding of where ""Beijing"" begins.
- ""出去了就都叫郊区"" (everything outside was called the suburbs) shows a symbolic boundary based on collective perception, not administrative or functional criteria.
- ""北京发展还是挺快的"" (Beijing has developed quite fast) provides context but does not directly define local identity.
- ""国外都以为中国还是农村"" (foreigners think China is still rural) contrasts outside perception with the author’s insider view but is not directly used to define local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key point is the author’s invocation of a **shared, historically rooted understanding of urban space**, where certain areas (like Dongcheng, Xicheng, Tiananmen) are symbolically central, and others are peripheral. This reflects a **socially habitual and symbolic spatial cognition** that defines what counts as the ""real"" or ""core"" Beijing in local perception.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that certain areas have symbolic centrality in defining what is ""Beijing"" and what is not, based on **collective memory and habitual usage** rather than administrative or functional criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author refers to a shared, habitual understanding of spatial boundaries and symbolic meanings (e.g., ""entering Beijing"") that reflect **local emotional maps and identity distinctions**, not official administrative lines.

门头沟挺好的本地人占大部份 生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多 就是逛街啥的不太行小时候总觉得城里方便 年纪越大越不爱回东边了,RL5,"  
The author expresses a positive view of Mentougou as a place where most residents are ""local,"" life is pleasant, the environment is good, and it's not crowded. They contrast this with the city (""城里"") which they felt was more convenient when they were younger, but now, as they've aged, they are less inclined to go back to the eastern part (""东边""). This implies a shift in preference and a sense of rootedness in Mentougou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本地人占大部份"" (locals make up the majority) — indicates a sense of local identity and belonging.
- ""生活挺惬意，环境好人也不多"" (life is pleasant, the environment is good, and it's not crowded) — reflects quality of life and environmental perception.
- ""逛街啥的不太行"" (not great for shopping) — reflects a functional limitation.
- ""小时候总觉得城里方便"" (used to think the city was more convenient as a kid) — implies past spatial perception.
- ""年纪越大越不爱回东边了"" (the older I get, the less I want to go back east) — implies a change in spatial identification and emotional attachment.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates Mentougou as a desirable living area based on its livability, environment, and non-crowdedness. The phrase ""本地人占大部份"" suggests a sense of belonging and local identity. However, the core argument revolves around how the author perceives Mentougou as a comfortable and preferable place to live — especially in contrast to the city — and this perception is tied to its environmental and functional qualities.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author endorses Mentougou as a high-quality local area based on its livability (pleasant life, good environment, not crowded).
- The mention of ""本地人占大部份"" is more descriptive than a standard the author uses to define ""local identity.""
- The author's shift in spatial identification (from preferring the city as a child to now preferring Mentougou) is based on environmental and lifestyle qualities, not administrative, linguistic, or occupational criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses environmental quality, lifestyle comfort, and low population density as key criteria to define Mentougou as a desirable local area — a standard that informs their sense of place and local identity. This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the area not just for its amenities, but as a marker of where ""local"" life is most suitable or desirable.

The author is emphasizing a historically rooted, culturally habitual way of understanding spatial boundaries and identity within the Beijing context. They argue that there is a long-standing and deeply embedded spatial cognition — that ""Beijing"" as a local identity refers specifically to the urban core (北京城), not the entire administrative area including places like Miyun. The author sees this as a historically grounded and linguistically ingrained perception, not just an administrative fact.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of ""京兆地区"" (Jingzhao region), ""天子脚下"" (under the emperor's feet), ""长城内的人"" (people within the Great Wall) suggest a historically sedimented and culturally symbolic understanding of what ""counts"" as Beijing.
- The distinction between ""去北京"" (go to Beijing) and ""去密云"" (go to Miyun) is framed as a matter of habitual spatial cognition, not administrative boundary.
- The phrase ""语言系统"" (language system) is used to support the idea that this is a shared, culturally embedded perception, not just personal opinion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not arguing based on administrative boundaries (RL2), family history (RL3), language use (RL4), or economic/social status (RL5/RL6). Instead, they are defending a **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perception** of what constitutes the core area of Beijing — a symbolic spatial boundary that persists despite administrative changes. This is used to define who or what counts as ""local"" in a symbolic or identity sense.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that ""Beijing"" in a local identity sense refers to a historically and culturally recognized core area, not the current administrative whole. This reflects a **socially shared, habitual spatial认知** that defines who is considered ""local"" based on symbolic geography.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, which refers to shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories — not based on official administrative boundaries but on collective emotional maps or cultural shorthand for assigning evaluative or symbolic labels relevant to ""local identity.""

Output: RL1"
房山柿子不行，房山最大的特产是跨区打工人,RL7,"  
The author is making a humorous but evaluative statement about房山 (Fangshan), suggesting that its most notable ""product"" is not a traditional agricultural or local specialty like persimmons, but rather 外区打工人 (""cross-district migrant workers""). This implies that the area is associated with people who commute from the suburbs to work in other districts, positioning Fangshan as a residential base for laborers rather than a culturally or economically central ""local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""跨区打工人"" (cross-district migrant workers): A specific occupational group, used to typify the population of the area.
- Implied contrast between traditional local products and the actual social identity of the area's residents.
- The author uses occupational identity to symbolically represent the character of the area and its people.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the occupational identity of ""migrant worker"" to redefine or mock the symbolic identity of Fangshan. Rather than being defined by its local produce or administrative status, the area is characterized by the type of people who live there — specifically, those who work elsewhere but reside locally. This serves as a boundary marker for what kind of ""local"" identity Fangshan has — one defined by labor mobility and peripheral urban positioning.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that the dominant occupational type in Fangshan — cross-district migrant workers — reflects the area's identity and, by extension, the kind of ""local"" people who reside there. This is not a neutral description but a symbolic typification of the area's residents.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL7: Occupational Typification**, where the author uses a specific occupational group (""cross-district migrant workers"") to symbolically define the local identity of Fangshan and its residents.

The author is describing their residential environment and lifestyle habits, comparing them to other areas like崇文门 (Chongwenmen) and望京 (Wangjing). They emphasize that where one lives affects the availability of amenities and quality of life. Although they personally appreciate the quietness, they also note that areas like Wangjing lack commercial vibrancy compared to central districts like Xidan or Financial Street. This implies a spatial hierarchy in terms of urban livability and possibly ""localness.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical references:** ""西北二环外"" (just outside the Second Ring Road in the northwest), ""西直门"" (Xizhimen), ""金融街西单"" (Financial Street/Xidan), ""王府井金宝街"" (Wangfujing/Jinbao Street), ""崇文门"" (Chongwenmen), ""望京"" (Wangjing) — these are all spatial identifiers that suggest different levels of urban centrality and symbolic meaning.
- **Functional livability references:** ""晚上七点除了几个遛弯儿的基本就没什么人了"" (very quiet at 7 p.m.), ""吃饭要不西直门，要不金融街西单"" (have to go elsewhere for dining), ""周围的批发市场全关了...购物和娱乐活动欠缺"" (lack of shopping/entertainment) — these describe the functional limitations of the area.
- **Personal evaluation:** ""清清静静的也挺好"" (quiet is nice) — reflects a subjective but still spatially grounded view of livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly evaluates the quality of different areas based on their spatial location and functional attributes. While they personally enjoy the quietness of living just outside the Second Ring Road, they acknowledge that this area lacks in amenities compared to central districts. This implies a belief that **urban centrality and access to services are key to defining what is a ""desirable"" or ""genuine"" local urban area**, and by extension, who counts as a ""local"" of such an area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author does **not** endorse **administrative boundaries**, **family rootedness**, **linguistic markers**, **occupational symbolism**, or **social embeddedness** as criteria for defining local identity.
- The author **does** imply that **spatial centrality** (e.g., being inside vs. just outside the Second Ring Road) and **functional livability** (amenities, vibrancy, accessibility) are important for evaluating the quality of a local area and possibly the identity of its residents.
- The author's **personal preference** for quietness does not negate the broader implication that **central areas with better amenities are more ""local"" in a functional or symbolic sense**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)** because the author evaluates different areas based on their **accessibility, amenities, and overall urban quality**, and by doing so, implicitly defines what kind of place is considered a **""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area**.

The author is describing a perception—held by ""你公公"" (your husband's father), who is characterized as a ""纯老北京"" (pure old Beijinger)—that **only the area within the Second Ring Road is truly considered ""Beijing""**, and that **the Third Ring Road is already suburban**. This reflects a **socially habitual and historically sedimented perception of intra-city spatial categories**, not based on administrative boundaries, but rooted in **local emotional maps and symbolic meanings**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环内才是北京"" (only within the Second Ring Road is truly Beijing) — spatial boundary definition.
- ""三环就是郊区了"" (the Third Ring Road is already the suburbs) — spatial perception and symbolic labeling.
- ""纯老北京"" (pure old Beijinger) — implies this perception is rooted in long-standing local consciousness or identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not expressing their own view directly, but **relaying and implicitly validating** a perspective held by a symbolic ""true local"" figure — a ""纯老北京."" This perspective **defines the scope of ""local"" (i.e., ""real Beijing"")** based on **habitual, symbolic spatial cognition**, not administrative or functional criteria. The author's use of this figure and the spatial boundary claim together **endorse a conventional local understanding** of who and where counts as ""truly local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not resist or question** this perception. Instead, they present it as a **representative or authoritative local viewpoint**, suggesting **implicit endorsement** of the spatial cognition it reflects — that is, a **shared, habitual perception of intra-city spatial categories** used to define ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses or endorses a **shared, habitual, and historically rooted perception of spatial boundaries** (Second Ring Road as core, Third Ring Road as suburban) to define what counts as ""Beijing"" and who counts as ""local.""

在北京待了5，6年吧，其实一开始并不喜欢北京，到后来慢慢习惯这里，再到现在喜欢这里，举个最新鲜的例子，我爸前几天来北京玩儿住了一个多星期，他是脑梗偏瘫，二级残疾，右手右胳膊动不了，可以走路，但行动不便，右腿拐着的，每次带他出去说实话我都提心掉胆尤其上地铁（贫困家庭出行真没法次次打车，而且北京真的很堵，晕车也很难受）让我感受最深的是主动让座的都是北京大爷大妈（年轻人似乎就只有一次让座难道真的是因为上班族怨气太重了吗）而且是我爸一上车他们就看出来有问题，立马让他去座那种，我真的，心里真的万分感激，嘴里也不停的在说谢谢,N/A,"  
The author shares a personal story about how their perception of Beijing evolved over time—from initial dislike to eventual acceptance and appreciation. The turning point in their emotional connection to Beijing is rooted in a specific experience: the kindness and attentiveness of older Beijing residents (Beijing大爷大妈) toward the author's disabled father during public transportation use. This experience made the author feel accepted and cared for in Beijing, contributing to their sense of belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""在北京待了5，6年吧"" – indicates a moderate length of residence, not yet rooted across generations (RL3 not fully triggered).
- ""慢慢习惯这里，再到现在喜欢这里"" – emotional attachment and adaptation to the city, but not necessarily tied to criteria the author uses to define ""local people.""
- ""主动让座的都是北京大爷大妈"" – highlights a behavioral and cultural trait associated with a specific local group.
- ""我爸一上车他们就看出来有问题"" – implies cultural or social perceptiveness and a shared sense of local empathy or social awareness.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, language, family history, or property.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author's emotional shift toward Beijing is based on the behavior and cultural traits of a specific local group (Beijing大爷大妈), which contributes to the author's sense of belonging. However, the author does **not** propose or endorse a specific **criterion for defining who is or is not a local**—they are describing a **cultural or behavioral experience** that influenced their personal feelings, not a **definition or standard** of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
While the text describes a meaningful cultural experience involving local people (RL4 might be tempting), the author **does not** use this to **define** who is or is not a ""local."" Instead, the text is focused on **emotional change** and **personal experience**, not on **criteria for local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
No RL category applies because the author does not propose or endorse any explicit or strongly implied **standard for defining ""local people""** identity or local area boundaries.

Output:"
北京地铁对坐轮椅的、盲人全程服务特别好,(none),"  
The author is expressing appreciation for the high-quality service provided by Beijing's subway system for people with disabilities, specifically those in wheelchairs and blind individuals. The statement highlights the accessibility and inclusiveness of the city's public transportation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of ""subway"" relate to functional livability (infrastructure accessibility).
- However, there is no mention of how this affects definitions of ""local people"" or local identity.
- There is no reference to administrative boundaries, family history, linguistic markers, social networks, or occupational types in relation to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is commenting on the quality of public services in Beijing, particularly regarding accessibility. While this reflects positively on the city's livability, it does not serve as a standard for defining ""local identity"" or distinguishing locals from non-locals.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL criteria are used by the author to define or evaluate ""local people"" identity or to establish boundaries of local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text discusses functional livability (RL5) in terms of public transportation accessibility, but it does **not** link this to any standard for defining ""local identity."" Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

The author shares their personal life experience and transformation in lifestyle and identity perception: from working in **Chaoyang** (a new urban district) to eventually returning to **Xicheng** (a traditional urban core), where they now enjoy a more convenient, peaceful, and livable life. They express a strong sense of **belonging and comfort** in Xicheng, in contrast to their earlier dissatisfaction with it. This shift is tied to their **current living conditions and environment**, not just administrative status, family history, or occupation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical reference**: Mentions of **Xicheng** (where they grew up and returned to) and **Chaoyang** (where they worked), indicating a contrast in spatial identity.  
- **Lifestyle features**: ""Bike to Beihai Park,"" ""walk to see a doctor,"" ""no need to drive,"" ""no traffic jams or restrictions"" — all reflect **functional convenience and environmental quality**.  
- **Evaluation of life quality**: ""Happiness index rises sharply,"" ""no longer go 'out of the city' to Chaoyang,"" ""how could I have endured so many years of congestion and restlessness in Chaoyang"" — these are strong **value judgments** about what makes a place a better ""local"" living space.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly **contrasts two types of urban spaces** — one they associate with convenience, peace, and livability (Xicheng), and another with congestion and stress (Chaoyang). They **endorse the idea** that a place qualifies as a desirable or authentic ""local"" living area **based on its livability and functional convenience**. The author's **identity transformation and sense of belonging** are rooted in this contrast.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the **functional livability** (convenience, environment, lifestyle) of Xicheng as a reason for returning and identifying with it.
- They **implicitly reject** the idea that working in a new urban district (Chaoyang) equates to being ""local"" in a meaningful or desirable way.
- This is **not** about administrative identity (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), or cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4), as these are not mentioned or implied as criteria for defining local identity.
- While social connections (e.g., living near amenities, small courtyard life) are present, they are framed as **aspects of functional livability**, not as standalone social networks or economic status (RL6).
- No occupational typification (RL7) is present.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author’s **core standard for defining a desirable or authentic ""local"" identity and space** is **functional livability and environmental quality**, which directly corresponds to **RL5**.

西村，44公里？？？？我只是看了地铁时长,RL5,"  
The author is responding to a mention of ""44 kilometers"" with confusion or skepticism, and clarifies that they base their judgment on **subway travel time**, not physical distance. This implies a focus on **transportation convenience** as a key factor in perceiving spatial relationships and evaluating the livability or accessibility of an area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""地铁时长"" (subway travel time) clearly points to **functional convenience** and **accessibility**.
- The author dismisses the relevance of ""44 kilometers"" (a measure of physical distance), suggesting that **administrative or physical geography is less important** than actual commuting experience.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, cultural identity, or economic/social networks.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses **transportation convenience (via subway)** as a **criterion for evaluating the practical ""localness"" or accessibility of a place**, suggesting that what matters is not how far something is in kilometers, but how easily it can be reached via public transport.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses subway travel time** as a **relevant standard for judging spatial relationships and, by implication, whether a place feels ""local"" or not**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author uses **transportation convenience**—a component of urban infrastructure and livability—as a **criterion to evaluate or define the accessibility and thus the perceived ""local"" quality of a place**.

Output: RL5"
我是外地来的牛马感觉都一样，反正天天住城中村挤地铁天天上班挨叼,** None,"  
The author expresses a sense of alienation and hardship as a non-local migrant worker (""外地来的牛马""), describing their daily life as monotonous and oppressive—living in a village in the city, commuting via crowded subways, and enduring harsh treatment at work (""挨叼""). The tone is one of resignation and self-identification as an outsider, but there is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any criteria for defining ""local identity."" The author is not articulating a standard by which someone is or isn't ""local""; rather, they are venting about their own marginalized status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""外地来的"" (from outside) – could imply origin or migration, but not used as a standard by the author for defining local identity.
- ""住城中村"" (live in a village within the city), ""挤地铁"" (crowded subway), ""上班挨叼"" (endure abuse at work) – describe living and working conditions, not identity criteria.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, cultural language, generational rootedness, or social embeddedness as a basis for defining ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument or endorsement of a standard for defining ""local identity."" The author is not drawing boundaries, proposing criteria, or even criticizing others for doing so—they are expressing personal hardship and a feeling of being treated as an outsider.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author does not propose or endorse any standard for defining ""local people,"" none of the RL categories apply. The text does not go beyond describing marginalization or hardship to define or evaluate local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
No RL category applies because the author does not present or endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity."" The text is a lament about social and economic conditions, not a statement on who counts as ""local"" or why.

最大的区别就是西边景色好，空气好，有山有水，不闹腾，宜居。东边各种污染严重，交通拥堵，不宜居。,RL5,"  
The author is making a **quality-of-place** comparison between the western and eastern parts of a city (or region), emphasizing that the **west is more livable** due to better scenery, air quality, natural features (mountains and water), and a quieter, more peaceful environment. In contrast, the **east is described as polluted, congested, and less suitable for living**. This suggests an evaluative standard for what constitutes a ""desirable"" or ""genuine"" local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""景色好，空气好，有山有水"" (good scenery, good air quality, with mountains and water) – environmental quality.  
- ""不闹腾，宜居"" (not noisy, livable) – quality of life and residential comfort.  
- ""污染严重，交通拥堵，不宜居"" (serious pollution, traffic congestion, not livable) – negative evaluation of environmental and infrastructural conditions.  
- The comparison implies that **livability and environmental quality** are used to judge the value and desirability of different parts of the city in relation to being ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing physical or environmental differences; they are **evaluating and ranking** areas based on **functional livability and environmental quality**, suggesting that the **west is more representative of a ""true"" or ""desirable"" local area** due to its superior living conditions.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **environmental quality and livability** are important in evaluating which parts of a city are more ""local"" or desirable for living. This aligns with a standard of **RL5**, where **functional livability is used as a marker of local identity or area legitimacy**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text uses **functional livability and environmental quality cognition** to define what the author considers a desirable or authentic local area. This matches **RL5**, which includes evaluating areas based on their **material infrastructure, environmental quality, and livability**, and using that evaluation to **define or rank what counts as a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area**.

The author is describing their personal spatial experience and perception of urban areas. They grew up in the eastern part of the city, rarely go to the west, and find the western area ""older"" in style. The mention of a long-absent chain store (仙踪林) reappearing in the west reinforces the sense of the west being more ""old-school"" or ""outdated"" compared to the east. This implies a habitual, culturally sedimented spatial perception of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从小在东边，真的很少去西边"" (grew up in the east, rarely go to the west) reflects habitual spatial orientation and identity.
- ""明显感觉比东边老派"" (clearly feels more old-fashioned than the east) shows a symbolic evaluation of space based on perceived modernity or development.
- ""仙踪林"" (a once-familiar chain store from childhood) serves as a nostalgic symbol of the old city center, reappearing in the west, reinforcing the idea that the west retains older urban characteristics.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their own lived experience and spatial familiarity to draw a distinction between the ""east"" (modern, familiar) and the ""west"" (old-fashioned, unfamiliar). This reflects a socially shared, habitual understanding of urban space — a kind of emotional or symbolic map of the city that informs their sense of where feels more or less ""local"" or part of the modern city core.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a habitual, symbolic spatial distinction — that the east is more central/modern/local and the west is more peripheral/old-fashioned/non-core. This is not administrative, linguistic, or economic, but a culturally sedimented spatial cognition.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author draws on personal experience and shared urban perceptions to define what parts of the city are symbolically or emotionally ""local"" or not.

开车都要这么久……那要是坐地铁不更远……是不是经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便啊，以后也发展不起来了吗,RL5,"  
The author is expressing concern about the inconvenience of commuting from延庆 (Yanqing) to the市区 (urban core), implying that its distance makes it unsuitable or undesirable as a residential area for those working in the city. The rhetorical question “是不是经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便啊，以后也发展不起来了吗” (Isn’t it inconvenient for people who work in the city center to live in Yanqing? Will it never develop in the future?) reflects an evaluation of the area’s livability and potential for development.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “开车都要这么久……那要是坐地铁不更远……” (It takes so long to drive… then wouldn’t taking the subway be even longer…): Indicates transportation inconvenience.
- “是不是经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便啊” (Isn’t it inconvenient for people who often work in the city center to live in Yanqing): Links inconvenience of location to residential choice and work-life integration.
- “以后也发展不起来了吗” (Will it never develop in the future): Implies a judgment on the area’s developmental potential, likely tied to its accessibility and livability.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates Yanqing as inconvenient for city-center workers and expresses doubt about its future development. This implies that proximity to the urban core, transportation convenience, and functional accessibility are used as standards to judge the desirability and developmental potential of a local area — criteria that are linked to how the author defines or imagines a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local living space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses accessibility and functional livability (especially in relation to commuting and integration with the urban core) as important standards for evaluating local areas and, by extension, what kind of area can be considered part of the desirable ""local"" space.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author is using criteria related to transportation convenience, commuting time, and the area’s perceived developmental potential to evaluate and implicitly define what constitutes a desirable or ""real"" local area.

Output: RL5"
延庆没有地铁只有长途公交，坐车的话3h打底了。在市区工作一定不要住延庆啊,RL5,"  
The author is advising against living in Yanqing due to its inconvenient transportation, emphasizing that it is connected to the city only by long-distance buses and takes at least 3 hours to commute. This implies a judgment about the livability and urban integration of the area, indirectly affecting its status as a desirable or ""true"" local residential area for those working in the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""No metro, only long-distance bus"" indicates a lack of convenient public transportation.  
- ""3 hours at minimum"" highlights the time burden of commuting.  
- ""Don't live in Yanqing if working in the city center"" is a direct evaluation of the area's functional livability and its incompatibility with urban lifestyles.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses transportation inconvenience and long commute times to argue that Yanqing is not a suitable place for people who work in the city center. This implies a standard for evaluating what kind of area qualifies as functionally integrated into the city — and by extension, what kind of residential area is appropriate for urban dwellers. This reflects a **functional livability-based** judgment of the area's ""local"" quality or desirability.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that inconvenient transportation and long commute times make Yanqing unsuitable for city workers. This reflects a **functional and livability-based** standard for defining what kind of area is considered ""genuinely local"" or appropriate for urban life.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, as the author evaluates Yanqing negatively based on transportation and commuting convenience — factors that affect the functional integration and livability of the area — and uses that to advise against considering it a viable or desirable local residential area.

The author contrasts two areas—**Chaoyang** (east) and the **Cuiwei area** (west)—and reflects on how each is socially and culturally perceived. They describe Chaoyang as ""fashionable"" and dominated by the private sector, while the west is seen as ""rustic"" but ""low-key,"" suggesting that these differences are tied to social identity and mutual perceptions of superiority/inferiority.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""住在朝阳，社会关系大多在翠微周边""** (""Live in Chaoyang, most social connections are around Cuiwei""): Indicates **social embeddedness** and **local social networks**.
- **""西边的确有点土""** (""The west is indeed a bit rustic"") and **""朝阳洋气不老少""** (""Chaoyang is quite fashionable""): Reflect **cultural-linguistic recognition** and **symbolic meanings** tied to areas.

- **""低调""** (""low-key"") vs. **""洋气""** (""fashionable"") and **""你看不上我，我看不上你""** (""you look down on me, I look down on you""): Highlight **symbolic spatial authority**, **identity boundaries**, and **habitual perceptions** of different areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **habitual spatial perceptions** (east vs. west), **social networks and local embeddedness**, **occupational symbolism**, and **cultural distinctions** to construct a layered understanding of local identity. These elements are not just descriptive—they are evaluative and used to **draw boundaries of belonging and superiority**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and expresses the idea that:
- There are **habitual, symbolic spatial distinctions** (east/west) used to define **who is considered ""local"" and how they are perceived**.
- **Occupational identity** (private sector vs. traditional sectors) and **economic structure** are used to **judge or rank local identities**.
- **Social embeddedness** (where one lives and has connections) plays a role in **defining local belonging**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author uses habitual, symbolic distinctions between areas (east vs. west) to define identity and belonging.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author emphasizes social networks and local connections as markers of identity.
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** The author highlights occupational and economic structure (private enterprise vs. traditional sectors) as a basis for identity ranking.

The author is comparing different urban districts (Haidian, Xicheng, Chaoyang) in terms of property value, lifestyle, and investment potential. They emphasize that Haidian has been home to multiple generations of families (""几代人都在海淀""), suggest that Haidian and Xicheng have more stable, high-value real estate (""优质房产保值度高""), and contrast this with Chaoyang’s more volatile property market and larger but less prestigious housing options.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""几代人都在海淀"" (several generations have lived in Haidian) → points to **family historical rootedness** (RL3).  
- Mention of ""房产保值度高"" (property maintains value well), ""能买3.500平的明星小区"" (can buy a 3,500 sqm celebrity compound), and contrasting housing options across districts → relates to **functional livability** and **social embeddedness**, but only if explicitly used to define ""local"" identity.  
- The distinction between districts and their symbolic status (e.g., ""fashion black hole"" for Haidian, implying self-awareness of local identity despite outsider perceptions) → may touch on **vernacular spatial cognition** (RL1), but not the main focus.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s strongest and most explicit endorsement lies in the idea that **multi-generational settlement in a district like Haidian confers a kind of ""true local"" status**. This is reinforced by the contrast with Chaoyang, which is associated with newer, less rooted residents who can afford larger houses but lack the generational legitimacy. While property value and district prestige are discussed, they are framed as **symptoms or outcomes** of deeper rootedness, not the **criteria** for defining local identity themselves.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is explicitly endorsed as the **core standard** for defining ""local identity"" in this passage.  
- **RL5 (Functional Livability)** is referenced (housing size, property value), but not explicitly used by the author as a standard for judging who is ""local.""  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is partially implied (property as a form of social capital), but not the main evaluative logic.  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is touched on (district reputations), but not used by the author as a **defining** criterion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author clearly uses **multi-generational family settlement** in a district (Haidian) as the **key standard** for defining ""true local"" identity, distinguishing it from newer residents or those living in less historically embedded areas like Chaoyang.

The author shares their personal residential history and expresses a clear preference for **living in Wangjing** over **Haidian**, particularly for young people. They describe Wangjing as more suitable for young people's lifestyles, offering convenience, leisure, and modernity, while Haidian is portrayed as run-down and desirable to leave once schooling is complete. This reflects a **subjective evaluation of urban areas based on functional livability** and how that affects the author’s perception of where is more ""genuinely local"" for certain lifestyles.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Geographical references:** Haidian, Wangjing — both are sub-districts within Beijing, used to distinguish different local experiences.
- **Functional livability terms:** “休闲自在啥都有” (has everything for leisure and convenience), “啥啥都破破的” (everything is run-down), “适合年轻人生活” (suitable for young people’s lifestyle) — these indicate the author is evaluating areas based on lifestyle quality.
- **Personal residential history and aspirations:** The author lived in both areas and expresses a strong desire to move back to Wangjing after returning to Haidian for schooling, showing how functional qualities influence their sense of place and belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly **using functional livability** — such as availability of amenities, lifestyle environment, and urban condition — to evaluate and compare different parts of Beijing. They imply that **Wangjing is a more desirable and ""local"" place for certain life stages or identities**, especially for young people. While they mention their personal history, the **core standard of judgment is not rootedness or family history (RL3), but rather the quality of the living environment and urban function (RL5)**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **Wangjing is better for young people due to its livability**, and **Haidian is undesirable beyond educational purposes**.
- This reflects a **subjective but clear standard of evaluating which areas are more ""local"" in terms of lifestyle and urban function**, not just personal taste.
- There is **no mention of administrative boundaries (RL2), language (RL4), occupation (RL7), or family history (RL3)** as defining criteria in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author is **using the material and lifestyle qualities of the urban environment** to define which areas are more ""genuinely local"" or desirable for specific social groups (e.g., young people).

我住东二环 我爸妈住东四环 上班在西四环 我每天上班我感觉像出国 再赶上西四环交通管制 （海关排队,RL1,"  
The author is expressing frustration about the spatial separation between where they live (eastern Second Ring Road), where their parents live (eastern Fourth Ring Road), and where they work (western Fourth Ring Road). The phrase ""每天上班我感觉像出国"" (going to work feels like going abroad) metaphorically conveys a sense of significant spatial and possibly cultural or identity-related distance. The mention of traffic control and ""海关排队"" (customs-style queuing) reinforces this metaphor, implying a sense of crossing into a different domain.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我住东二环"" (I live on the eastern Second Ring Road)  
- ""我爸妈住东四环"" (My parents live on the eastern Fourth Ring Road)  
- ""上班在西四环"" (Work is on the western Fourth Ring Road)  
- ""每天上班我感觉像出国"" (Going to work feels like going abroad)  
- ""再赶上西四环交通管制"" (Especially with traffic control on the western Fourth Ring Road)  
- ""海关排队"" (Customs-style queuing)  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key idea is the **sense of spatial separation and identity difference** implied by the author. The phrase “感觉像出国” (feels like going abroad) metaphorically constructs a boundary between areas, suggesting that moving from one ring road to another is akin to crossing a border. This implies an **implicit spatial identity logic** — certain areas are perceived as so distinct that they feel foreign, reinforcing a sense of ""us vs. them"" or insider/outsider.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not explicitly define who is or isn’t a local person, nor do they directly endorse a specific criterion for local identity. However, the metaphor of ""feeling like going abroad"" implies an **implicit endorsement of spatial boundaries as identity markers**, rooted in **habitual or socially accepted spatial perceptions**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author implicitly endorses a **socially shared perception of spatial boundaries** that differentiate areas not just physically, but also in terms of identity or belonging. The metaphor of crossing a border and customs-style traffic queues reflects a **symbolic understanding of urban space** that supports the idea of distinct local identity zones.

The author uses humor (""哈哈哈"") to express a sense of spatial separation between ""east"" and ""west,"" comparing it to ""different cities."" They mention the difficulty of driving to the east and their dislike of taking the subway, indirectly highlighting the inconvenience of cross-area mobility.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""东和西真的就像异地一样"" (The east and west really feel like different cities) implies a habitual spatial perception or emotional distance between areas.  
- ""开车去东边太难了"" (Driving to the east is too hard) and ""不爱坐地铁"" (don't like taking the subway) describe functional inconvenience but are not directly used to define ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase ""east and west feel like different cities"" reflects a socially shared perception of spatial division, suggesting an implicit boundary in local identity cognition. The transportation-related comments serve more as background explanation rather than the core standard for defining ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a habitual or emotional spatial boundary between east and west, treating them as distinct local identities or zones. This is not about administrative boundaries, family roots, or occupation, but rather about shared social perception of space.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author uses a shared perception of spatial division (""east"" and ""west as different"") to express a sense of local identity or belonging.

内片确实是一坨，房价原来挺低的，房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾,RL5,"  
The author expresses a negative evaluation of the ""neipian"" (inland/local area), criticizing it for having low housing prices in the past and implying that this low price leads to undesirable social elements (""容易滋生垃圾"" – ""prone to breeding trash""). This suggests a belief that housing price levels are tied to the quality of residents and the environment, and thus used as a standard to judge the value or desirability of a local area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""房价原来挺低的"" (housing prices used to be quite low)  
- ""房价低就有个坏处"" (low housing prices have a downside)  
- ""容易滋生垃圾"" (prone to breeding trash) – a derogatory term implying undesirable people or social conditions  
- The overall sentiment is that the area is undesirable due to its low housing prices and associated social environment  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses housing price levels as a proxy to judge the quality of a residential area and its residents, implying that areas with low housing prices are of lower status and not truly representative of a ""desirable"" or ""genuine"" local area. This reflects a standard for evaluating what kind of area counts as ""genuinely local"" or worthy of being considered part of the local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that housing price levels are linked to the quality of the area and its people, and thus uses this as a standard to evaluate the local area's desirability and status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author implicitly uses housing price and its associated living environment as a standard to judge the quality and legitimacy of a local area — suggesting that areas with low housing prices are not truly ""local"" in a desirable or accepted sense.

不算吧~最早那边是一大片荒地~小时候去石景山游乐园时下了地铁还要走好远才到~边上只有荒地什么都没有~后来慢慢建了小区~,RL1,"  
The author is expressing that the area being discussed was originally undeveloped (""a large expanse of wasteland"") and that it required a long walk from the subway to reach the only notable facility at the time (the Shijingshan Amusement Park). They then note that residential complexes were gradually built over time. This reflects a **change in spatial perception**—from an undeveloped area to one that is now likely seen as part of the urban fabric.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""A large expanse of wasteland"" indicates the area was not previously seen as a developed or habituated part of the city.
- ""Had to walk a long way from the subway"" implies it was spatially and functionally peripheral.
- ""Later slowly built residential complexes"" shows a transformation in the area’s status and spatial perception over time.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on how the area used to be perceived (as undeveloped and peripheral) and by implication, how such perceptions may have influenced whether people considered it part of the ""real"" or ""core"" local area. This supports the idea that **local identity is tied to shared or evolving spatial perceptions**—what areas are habitually or emotionally recognized as ""the city"" or ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly acknowledges that **habitual or historically sedimented perceptions of space** (i.e., which areas were seen as part of the city and which were not) play a role in defining what counts as ""local."" They do not explicitly endorse or reject this as a standard for local identity, but they **describe it as a common understanding**, which is sufficient for annotation since it reflects a **shared spatial认知**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it discusses how certain areas were historically seen as undeveloped or peripheral, and how this perception changed over time, influencing people's habitual understanding of which areas ""count"" as part of the city or local identity.

你不会说反了吧海淀新区的大马路对着大山，心情一下就开朗了,None,"  
The author is expressing a positive emotional response to the spatial layout and natural scenery of ""Haidian New District"" — specifically, how the wide roads face the mountains, creating a sense of openness and relief in mood. There is no mention of identity, belonging, or criteria for defining ""local people."" The focus is purely on aesthetic or emotional experience tied to the environment.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Haidian New District"" (海淀新区): a place name, but used descriptively, not evaluatively in terms of local identity.  
- ""Big roads facing the mountains"" and ""mood suddenly becomes cheerful"": relate to environmental perception and emotional reaction, not to identity or boundary-making.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument or evaluation regarding who counts as ""local"" or what defines local identity. The text simply conveys a positive emotional response to the physical environment of a place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL categories apply because the author is not making any claim about how ""local people"" are defined, nor are they endorsing any standard related to space, language, family, occupation, etc., in relation to identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
No RL category is applicable because the text does not engage with criteria for defining ""local identity.""

The author, identifying as a ""city-born Beijing native"" (城里土生土长的北京人), expresses a long-standing, habitual perception of Beijing’s spatial boundaries and identity. They draw symbolic spatial boundaries that distinguish the ""urban core"" from ""rural"" areas. These boundaries are not administrative but reflect a socially shared, historically rooted emotional and cognitive map of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Self-identification as a ""city-born Beijing native"" (城里土生土长的北京人) implies rootedness and local identity.
- Multiple spatial demarcations are drawn: ""东边过了东大桥就是农村"", ""西边过了官园就是农村"", etc., showing a habitual cognitive map of urban vs. rural.
- Mentions of past practices such as needing ""郊直费"" (suburban direct-call fees) and traveling to places like Yanqing requiring a train reflect historical and symbolic distinctions.
- Place names like Tongzhou (通县), Shunyi, and Yanqing are described with a sense of distance and rural othering.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses these spatial demarcations to construct a symbolic boundary system that defines what areas are considered ""truly urban"" or ""local"" in contrast to those seen as ""rural"" or ""outside."" This reflects a **socially shared, habitual understanding of space** that contributes to the definition of ""local people"" identity—those who live within these cognitive urban boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and expresses a habitual, symbolic understanding of spatial boundaries as a way to define ""local"" identity. This is not administrative (RL2), not based on family history (RL3), nor linguistic (RL4), but rather a **socially sedimented cognitive map** of the city.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author defines local identity based on shared, habitual, and historically sedimented perceptions of urban space, not official administrative lines.

老北京话里的东富西贵指的是二环以里，没朝阳什么事。而且是真正的二环城圈儿里，就是地铁2号线以里。朝阳那时候还农村呢，压根不在这个老话指的范围内。,RL1,"  
The author is explaining a historically rooted, culturally embedded perception of Beijing’s spatial hierarchy — that the saying ""东富西贵"" (the east is rich, the west is noble) refers specifically to the area **within the Second Ring Road**, i.e., the traditional urban core, and **not** to areas like Chaoyang. They further clarify that Chaoyang was still rural and not included in this traditional conceptualization. This reflects a **socially habitual and symbolic understanding of urban space**, used to define what counts as the ""local"" or ""true"" Beijing core.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老北京话"" (old Beijing dialect saying) indicates culturally embedded spatial cognition.  
- ""东富西贵"" is a symbolic spatial classification rooted in historical perception.  
- ""指的是二环以里"" and ""地铁2号线以里"" define a specific geographical boundary based on **habitual, traditional understanding**, not administrative status.  
- ""朝阳那时候还农村呢"" emphasizes that Chaoyang was not part of this traditional symbolic core.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a distinction between areas that are **symbolically and historically recognized as part of the ""true"" Beijing** and those that are not. This is not about administrative boundaries, economic function, or personal preference — it's about **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented understandings of urban space** that define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **traditional, culturally embedded spatial perceptions** (like which areas are included in the saying ""东富西贵"") define the symbolic core of Beijing and, by extension, who counts as a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author explains that older generations do not strongly identify with district-level administrative divisions, likely due to frequent administrative boundary changes over time. Instead, they emphasize identifying with more localized, specific place names (e.g., 凤山门, 望江门, 四牌楼, etc.), which correspond to street or village-level locations. These names represent a habitual, culturally embedded spatial认知 that reflects local identity. The author implies that these vernacular place names—not administrative districts—are the true markers of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific local place names (凤山门, 望江门, 四牌楼, etc.) indicate habitual or historical spatial认知.  
- The author contrasts these with administrative districts, which are only used when communicating with outsiders who don’t know the local geography.  
- The phrase “本地人只会说自己待的这个地方的地名” shows that local people use these vernacular names as the basis for expressing identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly argues that local identity is defined not by administrative boundaries but by shared, habitual, and historically rooted perceptions of space—represented by specific local place names. These names function as cultural shorthand for local belonging and reflect a social consensus about what constitutes ""local"" space.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of historically sedimented, socially shared local place names as the standard for expressing and identifying local identity, rather than administrative districts.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, which refers to shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories used as cultural shorthand for assigning evaluative or symbolic labels relevant to ""local identity.""

The author shares a personal experience of being corrected by so-called ""local"" Hangzhou people for identifying as a Hangzhou resident, only to be told that because they are from Yuhang (a district outside the core urban area), they are not ""real"" Hangzhou people. This reflects a social hierarchy in defining ""local identity"" based on **habitual spatial cognition**—i.e., the belief that certain areas (like the urban core) are more authentically ""Hangzhou"" than others (like Yuhang), and that this spatial identity should determine who can claim to be a ""real"" local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""老余杭"" (old Yuhang): Refers to a specific area outside the core urban zone, used as a habitual label for non-core locals.
- ""市区没房子"" (no property in the urban district): Implies that living in the core urban area is a marker of legitimacy.
- ""不要说自己是杭州人"" (don't say you're from Hangzhou): A boundary-drawing behavior that excludes non-core area residents from the ""local"" identity.
- ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin): A derogatory term used to distinguish urban core locals from those in peripheral areas.
- ""小时候不理解...后来有点理解了"" (didn't understand before... now somewhat understand): Shows the author has internalized the social logic that spatial origin (specifically, being from the urban core) is a key criterion for claiming ""local"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is recounting how they were socially corrected for identifying as Hangzhou due to being from Yuhang, and now they understand that the **habitual spatial boundary**—between urban core and suburban/peripheral areas—plays a central role in defining who is considered a ""real"" local. This reflects a **socially sedimented perception of intra-city spatial categories**, not based on administrative boundaries or family history, but on **shared cultural understanding** of which areas are seen as the ""real"" city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
Although the author was on the receiving end of exclusion, they **now accept the logic** that calling oneself Hangzhou should depend on being from the urban core, not just any area under the Hangzhou administrative umbrella. The author now self-identifies as ""Yuhang"" or ""Hangzhou suburban"" rather than simply ""Hangzhou,"" indicating they have internalized this spatial boundary as a legitimate standard for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author's understanding of local identity is based on **habitual, socially shared perceptions of spatial hierarchy within the city**, not on administrative boundaries or family history.

真的是这样，我也是余杭的，一直都说是“去杭州”，而不是去“市区”，说实在的，我们没归属感，人家也不当我们是自己人,RL1,"  
The author, identifying as from Yuhang, expresses a sense of **lack of belonging** both internally (""we don't feel a sense of belonging"") and externally (""others don't treat us as one of their own""). They highlight a habitual way of speaking — referring to going to Hangzhou as “去杭州” (going to Hangzhou), not “去市区” (going to the urban core) — which reflects a **socially accepted spatial perception** that distinguishes Yuhang from the perceived core of Hangzhou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “我也是余杭的” (I’m also from Yuhang) – identity tied to a specific area.  
- “去杭州” instead of “市区” – reflects a **symbolic spatial perception** of Hangzhou’s core vs. periphery.  
- “没归属感” and “人家也不当我们是自己人” – indicates **lack of emotional or social integration**, possibly due to spatial or administrative identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing geography or administrative boundaries, but is expressing a **shared perception** that Yuhang is not seen as part of the core Hangzhou identity — both by locals from Yuhang and by others. This reflects a **socially habitual spatial cognition**, not just administrative or physical distance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **habitual spatial perception** (not just administrative classification) defines who is considered part of the local group. They do not resist this view but present it as a lived reality.

The author is challenging the definition of ""rural"" or ""countryside"" (""乡下"") and questioning the criteria others might use to label a place or person as such. They argue that many areas have people with **urban hukou**, parents who are **workers or public servants**, and **no rural land ties**, yet are still called ""countryside."" The author resists the idea that such areas should be considered rural, implying that the label is being misapplied.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""出生就是城镇户口"" (born with urban hukou) → **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**
- ""父母都是工人或者事业单位公务员"" (parents are workers or public servants) → **RL7: Occupational Typification**
- ""家里没有土地"" (no family land) → contrasts with rural/family rootedness markers, but not directly RL3 unless used as a standard for defining local identity
- The author's challenge to the label of ""乡下"" (rural) suggests they reject an implicit standard being used by others to judge ""local"" status

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **rejecting** a standard (likely based on outdated or inaccurate assumptions) that labels certain places or people as rural. They use **administrative status (hukou)** **occupational background**, and **absence of rural land ties** to argue that such places should not be considered rural.  
However, since the author is **not endorsing** these as their own criteria, but rather **refuting others' criteria**, we must be cautious in annotation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **does not endorse** rural labeling based on outdated or inaccurate standards.
- They **do not propose a new standard** of their own but **reject** the idea that certain areas are rural based on others' logic.
- However, the **logic they use to reject** that label includes **urban hukou** and **non-agricultural occupations**, which are **RL2 and RL7** markers.
- Since the author uses these to **argue against being considered rural**, it implies they **do endorse** these as relevant criteria in defining urban/local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author uses **urban hukou (RL2)** and **non-agricultural occupations (RL7)** to argue that certain people or places should not be labeled as rural. These are **endorsed by the author** as **valid markers of local/urban identity**, even if framed in a challenge to others' views.

The author expresses frustration and resistance toward being labeled as ""country bumpkins"" despite having lived and studied in the area (e.g., Yuhang) for a long time. They argue that the original scope of Hangzhou was very small and has expanded by incorporating surrounding areas. This implies a critique of how ""real Hangzhou people"" are defined and a defense of their own local identity based on long-term residence and the changing spatial boundaries of the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Read a university in Hangzhou"" / ""Yuhang read 12 years of school""** – indicates long-term educational and residential history in the area.  
- **""Hard to stick Hangzhou"" / ""Old Hangzhou"" / ""Original Hangzhou"" / ""Swallowed up so much""** – references to changing administrative and spatial boundaries, and the speaker’s resistance to being excluded from the local identity despite being part of the newly incorporated areas.  
- **""Discrimination against rural people"" / 'no sense of belonging'** – reflects tension between administrative belonging and social/cultural recognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author challenges the legitimacy of exclusion based on outdated notions of where ""real"" Hangzhou people come from. They emphasize their own rootedness (long-term residence and education) and the historical fact that Hangzhou has expanded by absorbing surrounding areas. This implies that both **family rootedness (RL3)** and **vernacular spatial cognition (RL1)** should be the basis for defining local identity, rather than exclusionary cultural or social practices.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that long-term settlement and education in the area (Yuhang) qualify them as ""local,"" aligning with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
- The author **implicitly endorses** a broader, historically grounded perception of Hangzhou’s spatial identity, resisting narrow or traditional definitions of the city, aligning with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.  
- Although discrimination and cultural identity (e.g., accents, stereotypes) are mentioned, the author **resists** these as criteria and does **not endorse** them as valid standards for defining local identity — thus **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** does **not** apply.  
- The author also critiques the changing administrative boundaries but focuses more on **social perceptions** and **historical evolution of spatial identity**, not administrative legitimacy per se — so **RL2** is **not emphasized**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author humorously describes a process where correctly identifying a specific local area in Hangzhou (e.g., ""Wulinmen,"" ""Caihe,"" ""Cuiyuan,"" ""Chaohui"") acts like a ""password"" to trigger a switch to speaking **Hangzhou dialect**, specifically the old urban area version. This implies that knowing and using these local place names, along with speaking the local dialect, is a symbolic marker of being a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Correctly answering Hangzhou-specific place names** (e.g., Wulinmen, Caihe) — indicates familiarity with local spatial cognition.
- **Switching to Hangzhou dialect (老市区范围的杭州话)** — indicates linguistic-cultural recognition.
- **Awareness of dialect differences over short distances** — reinforces the idea that accent and dialect are identity markers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **local place name recognition** and **dialect switching** as symbolic indicators of local identity. These are not just preferences or observations but are framed as **shared cultural codes** that distinguish insiders from outsiders. The text implies that these cultural and linguistic markers are **actively used by locals to identify one another** and exclude others.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses:
- **Knowledge of local place names** (which are part of the shared spatial cognition of the city — RL1).
- **Use of the local dialect** (Hangzhouhua, especially the old urban variant — RL4).

These are **endorsed and used to define ""local people"" identity** in the context of social interaction.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The correct identification of local neighborhoods (like Wulinmen, Caihe) reflects shared, habitual spatial knowledge that distinguishes locals from non-locals.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The switch to Hangzhou dialect — especially the old urban version — is portrayed as a cultural boundary marker that confirms local identity.

Both criteria are used by the author to define who counts as a local in a social interaction context.

别说其他区了，我是西湖区三墩的浙大紫金港这边，小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州。对外都说自己三墩乡下人。,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a historically ingrained, habitual perception of spatial identity within Hangzhou. They describe how growing up in the San Dun area of Xihu District, going to Longxiang Bridge was seen as ""going to Hangzhou,"" implying that San Dun was not symbolically or socially perceived as the core of Hangzhou. The self-identification as ""三墩乡下人"" (""countryside person from San Dun"") reflects an internalized understanding of spatial hierarchy and social perception of which areas are considered ""central"" or ""local"" within the city.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""西湖区三墩"" (San Dun, Xihu District) — a specific intra-city location.
- ""小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州"" — going to Longxiang Bridge was described as ""going to Hangzhou,"" indicating a perceived boundary between ""Hangzhou"" and ""not quite Hangzhou.""
- ""对外都说自己三墩乡下人"" — self-identification as ""countryside"" reflects a socially habitual spatial hierarchy and self-positioning within it.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not denying this perception but rather reflecting it as part of their lived experience. This indicates that they accept, at least implicitly, the conventional understanding that certain parts of the city (like San Dun) are socially perceived as peripheral or not fully part of the symbolic core of ""Hangzhou."" This reflects a shared, habitual perception of spatial categories — a form of **vernacular spatial authority**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that there are **symbolic boundaries** within the city — that some areas (like Longxiang Bridge) are seen as the ""real"" Hangzhou, while others (like San Dun) are not. This is not administrative, not based on family history, and not about language or culture, but rather a **socially shared perception of spatial hierarchy**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author reflects a socially habitual understanding of which areas ""count"" as the local core and which are symbolically peripheral.

不一定因为杭州市区的瞧不起周边的又因为杭州政府做的不地道很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感，问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了,None,"  
The author challenges the idea of a unified ""local"" identity centered on the urban core of Hangzhou. They suggest that many people in surrounding areas do not feel a sense of belonging to Hangzhou, partly due to perceived unfair treatment by the Hangzhou government and social hierarchies where the市区 (urban core) looks down on the periphery. The author emphasizes that when someone is asked ""where are you from,"" it's really a question of personal identification — not administrative, cultural, or generational criteria.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""杭州市区的瞧不起周边的"" (urban residents look down on those from the periphery): may relate to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) or RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), but the author **does not endorse** this view — they are describing a social dynamic they are critical of.  
- ""杭州政府做的不地道"" (Hangzhou government acted improperly): relates to governance or policy, but not directly to defining ""local identity.""  
- ""很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感"" (many district residents don't feel a sense of belonging to Hangzhou): speaks to emotional or psychological identification, but not a standard the author **uses** to define ""local people.""  
- ""问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了"" (asking where you're from is just asking how you personally identify): this is the **core endorsed view** — the author believes that local identity is a matter of personal self-identification, not based on external criteria like geography, culture, or family.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author explicitly **rejects** the idea that ""local identity"" should be defined by administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic traits, or spatial hierarchies. They argue instead that it's a matter of **personal identification**. None of the RL categories reflect this view, as they all focus on **external, socially constructed criteria** used to define ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria. They **reject** the use of spatial, administrative, cultural, or historical criteria for defining ""local people."" Their stance is that identity is subjective and personal.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author self-identifies as a ""Hangzhou countryside person"" from the Sandun Town in Xihu District, and points out that their way of speaking differs from that of ""city people."" This indicates a self-awareness of being socially or culturally distinct from the urban core, partly due to dialect or speech habits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""西湖区三墩镇"" (Sandun Town, Xihu District) indicates a specific local area outside the perceived urban core.  
- ""杭州乡下人"" (Hangzhou countryside person) implies a self-identification that contrasts with the ""city people.""  
- ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" (""the way we speak is different from them city people"") highlights linguistic distinction as a marker of identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses linguistic differences—specifically the way they speak—as a boundary marker between themselves and urban residents. This implies that language plays a role in how ""local identity"" is perceived or defined, especially in contrast to the urban core.

会啊，城里的就不太看得起我们这种乡下的，虽然钱还没我们多，像我们西湖区都是乡下地方，讲的都是老余杭的话，跟他们上城下城都是讲杭州话的，还是有点差别，哈哈哈啊,"RL1, RL4","  
The author acknowledges a sense of social and cultural distinction between ""city people"" and ""countryside people,"" noting that despite having more financial resources, people from rural areas like Xihu District are still looked down upon. The author also highlights linguistic differences—using ""old Yuhang dialect"" versus the ""Hangzhou dialect"" spoken in urban areas—as a key marker of identity. This reflects both cultural-linguistic recognition and a sense of spatial social hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""城里的就不太看得起我们这种乡下的"" (city people look down on us country folks): reflects social perception and possibly social rootedness or cultural distinction.  
- ""西湖区都是乡下地方"" (Xihu District is a rural area): reflects habitual spatial cognition—how areas are socially categorized.  
- ""讲的都是老余杭的话"" (speak old Yuhang dialect) and ""上城下城都是讲杭州话"" (urban areas speak Hangzhou dialect): reflects linguistic-cultural identity markers.  
- The overall tone is humorous but self-aware, implicitly accepting that these factors are used by society to distinguish ""local"" or ""urban"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts that both spatial categorization (urban vs. rural areas) and linguistic-cultural recognition (dialects) are used as criteria for judging who is considered a ""real local"" or ""urban"" person. These are not resisted but rather acknowledged as existing social standards.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses both habitual spatial cognition (urban vs. rural area perception) and linguistic-cultural recognition (dialect differences) as standards used to define ""local"" or ""urban"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author treats Xihu District as a ""rural"" area and distinguishes it from ""urban"" areas like Shangcheng and Xiacheng, reflecting habitual social spatial cognition.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** The author contrasts ""old Yuhang dialect"" with ""Hangzhou dialect"" as a cultural boundary marker, used to distinguish insiders and outsiders.

Output: RL1, RL4"
你同学说错了，西湖区也是乡下，因为我们这讲的都是余杭话，其他几个区讲的都是杭州话,RL4,"  
The author is correcting their classmate's statement, asserting that the Xihu District should also be considered ""countryside"" or non-core area, based on the linguistic distinction that people there speak Yuhang dialect, whereas other districts speak Hangzhou dialect. This implies that **language variation** is being used as a marker to distinguish between ""local"" (core urban) and ""non-local"" (peripheral/countryside) identities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""西湖区也是乡下"" (Xihu District is also the countryside) – suggests a **spatial evaluation**.
- ""我们这讲的都是余杭话"" (We speak Yuhang dialect here) – points to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.
- ""其他几个区讲的都是杭州话"" (Other districts speak Hangzhou dialect) – contrasts the author’s area with others linguistically.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **linguistic difference** (Yuhang dialect vs. Hangzhou dialect) to **redefine spatial identity boundaries**, arguing that despite being an urban district, Xihu is still culturally and linguistically aligned with the countryside. This reflects a **cultural-linguistic boundary** used to define who counts as ""local"" Hangzhou people.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically dialect differences) as a standard for judging local identity and distinguishing between ""core locals"" and ""peripheral locals"" or ""non-locals"".

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses dialect differences to define local identity and spatial belonging.

那你是杭州市区的吧，我是富阳的，以前是独立的市，前几年才划进杭州的,RL2,"  
The author contrasts their own identity as someone from Fuyang — which used to be an independent city — with someone from ""Hangzhou proper"" (the urban core), pointing out that Fuyang was only recently incorporated into Hangzhou administratively. This implies that **administrative boundary changes** have an impact on how ""local"" identity is perceived and categorized.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""以前是独立的市"" (used to be an independent city) — indicates a historical administrative status.  
- ""前几年才划进杭州的"" (was only incorporated into Hangzhou in recent years) — highlights a recent administrative change.  
- The distinction between ""Hangzhou urban area"" and ""Fuyang"" reflects a boundary-based understanding of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **administrative incorporation** as the key criterion to differentiate between types of ""local"" identity — implying that being ""from Hangzhou"" is not the same as being from a newly incorporated district like Fuyang. This reflects the **legitimacy or perception of local identity based on administrative boundaries**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly sees administrative incorporation (划进) as a defining factor in how local identity is constructed and perceived, and they present this as a factual and meaningful distinction — not something they oppose or merely describe as others believe.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses the logic of administrative boundary changes and jurisdictional incorporation to define or differentiate ""local"" identity.

你猜怎么着，你划的滨江萧山这边本地人，平时去市区都会说：去杭州玩，还有东边划得都到七堡了，我那边的同学可不认为他是市中心的你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗,RL1,"  
The author is criticizing the way certain areas (e.g., Binjiang and Xiaoshan) are administratively or symbolically included within the broader ""Hangzhou"" urban identity. They argue that even though these areas may now be officially incorporated into Hangzhou, the people living there still do not perceive themselves as part of the ""city center"" or ""Hangzhou proper."" The author implies that this redefinition of boundaries is more about self-inclusion than shared identity or perception.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""你划的滨江萧山这边本地人"" (you划的 as in ""you define"" or ""you include"") — implies a boundary-drawing or administrative logic.  
- ""去杭州玩"" (go to Hangzhou to play) — shows a symbolic distinction between ""here"" and ""Hangzhou,"" indicating that the speaker does not see their area as part of the core city.  
- ""我那边的同学可不认为他是市中心的"" (my classmates don’t consider it the city center) — reflects a socially shared perception of spatial identity.  
- ""你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗"" (you划 in your own home first) — critiques the subjective and self-serving nature of boundary-drawing, suggesting that the speaker sees this as a symbolic or administrative move rather than a reflection of real local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that **administrative redistricting or symbolic boundary expansion does not equate to genuine local identity**. The real test of being ""local"" or part of the city center is **social perception and habitual understanding of space**, not just being within a newly drawn boundary.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they support the **habitual, socially shared understanding of space (RL1)** — that people still see themselves as separate from the city center even if administratively included.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** category. The author emphasizes that **local identity is defined by shared, habitual spatial perceptions**, not by official redistricting. The idea that people still say “go to Hangzhou to play” and that “my classmates don’t think they are in the city center” supports the idea that **socially sedimented spatial cognition, not administrative change, defines local identity**.

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,"RL3, RL1","  
The author recalls a former colleague who is a ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (born and raised Hangzhou local), and emphasizes that this person only knows three specific streets: where her parents live (Jiefang Road), where she lives after marriage (Fengqi Road), and where she works (Qingchun Road). The author uses this anecdote to illustrate a certain kind of localized, deeply rooted urban experience that defines what it means to be a ""local"" in Hangzhou — not through broad knowledge of the city, but through long-term, intimate connections to a few core locations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (born and raised Hangzhou local) — directly references family rootedness and long-term local upbringing.
- The colleague only knows three streets — suggests a habitual, localized spatial perception and identity.
- These streets are not just physical locations but symbolic of family, residence, and work — implying a habitual and emotional connection to specific parts of the city.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author uses the concept of being ""born and raised"" in Hangzhou as the foundation for defining ""local identity."" The limited spatial awareness (only three streets) is not seen as a deficit, but rather as a sign of deep, habitual connection to a localized part of the city — reinforcing the idea that being a local is not about geographic breadth, but depth of rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author clearly endorses **family rootedness** and **long-term upbringing** in the city as the basis for local identity.
- There is also an implicit endorsement of **habitual spatial cognition** — knowing a few key streets well is enough to be considered a local.
- However, the **core standard** emphasized is the **long-term, generational rootedness** in the city, which is used to affirm the colleague's local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The phrase ""土生土长"" directly matches this category, as it emphasizes being born and raised in the area as the foundation for being considered a ""true local.""
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The limited but deep spatial knowledge (only three streets) reflects a habitual, emotional, and symbolic understanding of the city — a form of local spatial cognition that defines who belongs.

你都划到萧山了，就把我最顶上的大塘栖也划进去呗，让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验,RL2,"  
The author is expressing a desire or mild complaint about administrative boundary changes—specifically, that although ""Xiaoshan"" has already been incorporated into the urban administrative division, the author's location (""Dang Tangqi"") has not. The author wishes to be included in the ""urban"" category to experience what it's like to ""live in the city."" This implies that the author believes administrative designation carries symbolic or experiential value in defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""划到"" (incorporated into) indicates administrative redistricting.
- ""萧山"" (Xiaoshan) is used as a place that has been administratively incorporated.
- ""大塘栖"" (Dang Tangqi) is the author's location, currently not considered part of the ""city.""
- ""住在市区"" (living in the city) reflects the author's desire to be seen as a ""city local"" through administrative designation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is commenting on how administrative boundaries shape identity and the experience of being ""local."" Although the author may not be explicitly stating that administrative legitimacy *should* be the standard for defining local identity, they are clearly implying that being administratively included in the city would change their status or experience, which indicates an implicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy as a defining factor.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts that administrative designation (e.g., being ""划进"" or incorporated into the city) defines who is considered a ""city local"" and expresses a desire to be included in that category. This aligns with RL2.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author's belief that administrative boundaries are used to determine who is considered a ""local city resident,"" and expresses a wish to be included in that category. This aligns with RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.

杭州人至少要说杭州话，萧山话杭州人都听不懂，硬划进杭州市区，别说杭州人了，问问萧山人干吗？,RL4,"  
The author is arguing that speaking Hangzhou dialect is a necessary condition for being considered a ""true"" Hangzhou person. They point out that Xiaoshan dialect is so different that even Hangzhou people cannot understand it, suggesting that administrative incorporation into Hangzhou does not automatically make Xiaoshan residents ""Hangzhou people."" The author is clearly resisting the idea that administrative legitimacy alone defines local identity and instead emphasizes linguistic-cultural recognition.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Hangzhou people at least should speak Hangzhou dialect"" directly ties local identity to linguistic recognition.  
- ""Xiaoshan dialect is incomprehensible to Hangzhou people"" highlights linguistic differences as a boundary marker.  
- ""Forcibly incorporated into Hangzhou's urban area"" refers to administrative boundaries but is explicitly rejected as a defining standard.  
- The rhetorical question ""Ask the Xiaoshan people themselves!"" implies that even Xiaoshan residents may not identify as Hangzhou people, reinforcing identity based on cultural and linguistic factors rather than administrative status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses linguistic difference as the core criterion to define who is truly a ""Hangzhou person."" They reject administrative legitimacy (RL2) as sufficient for local identity and instead assert that shared dialect and cultural understanding are essential.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **linguistic-cultural recognition** (ability to speak Hangzhou dialect) as the standard for defining local identity, and implicitly rejects administrative legitimacy (RL2) as insufficient.

"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。
 那么任嚣城又有怎样深厚的历史故事呢？它和现在的广州又有怎样的密切联系呢？感兴趣的朋友请看下期小明的讲解哦",RL1,"  
The author aims to clarify the distinction between the **historical concept of ""Guangzhou city""** and the **modern administrative and urban concept of ""Guangzhou城区 (urban area)""**. They emphasize that **local people (especially native Cantonese speakers and广府 people)** have a different, more historically rooted understanding of what constitutes the ""true"" Guangzhou urban area—centered around the ""老四区"" (old four districts), especially越秀老城区 (Yuexiu old urban area). This reflects a **socially habitual and historically sedimented perception of urban space**, used to distinguish authentic ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""Old four districts"" (老四区: 越秀, 东山, 荔湾不含芳村, 河南)** – specific spatial categories used by locals to define the core area of Guangzhou.  
- **Historical references** like ""任嚣城"", ""番禺城"", and the evolution of urban boundaries – indicating long-standing spatial cognition.  
- **Contrast between外地人 (non-locals) and本地人 (locals/locals themselves)** in how they perceive Guangzhou’s urban core – non-locals associate modern landmarks (e.g., 珠江新城, 广州塔) with Guangzhou, while locals identify with the older, more historically rooted areas.  
- **""河南"" refers only to certain parts of Haizhu District** – showing that even within an administrative district, locals make fine-grained distinctions based on traditional spatial understanding.  
- **Discussion of historical settlement patterns** – e.g., 桂花岗, 环市北 were once farmland, implying that current urban areas were not always considered ""Guangzhou proper.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a **local spatial identity** based on **habitual, historical, and socially shared perceptions of where ""real Guangzhou"" is located**. This is used to distinguish between **superficial or tourist-based understandings of the city** and **deep-rooted, local-based understandings rooted in history and tradition**. The author clearly endorses the **local habitual understanding** of the city’s spatial identity and implies that it is more authentic.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that the true Guangzhou urban area is defined by **historically sedimented, socially shared spatial understandings**, especially among locals. This includes:
- Distinguishing between modern landmarks and traditional core areas.
- Emphasizing the ""old four districts"" as the true urban core.
- Making fine-grained spatial distinctions (e.g., ""河南"" ≠ all of Haizhu).
- Highlighting the historical continuity from 任嚣城 to modern Yuexiu.

These are **not administrative boundaries (RL2)**, **not about family history (RL3)**, **not about language (RL4)**, **not about property or social status (RL6)**, and **not about occupation (RL7)**.

The author presents a historical overview of the administrative and naming changes of ""花都"" (Huadu), tracing its evolution from ancient times to its current status as a district of Guangzhou. This timeline emphasizes the **administrative legitimacy** and **jurisdictional changes** that have defined the area’s status over time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Repeated references to administrative changes: “属番禺管辖” (under the jurisdiction of Panyu), “划为广州市属县” (designated as a county under Guangzhou), “撤市设区” (abolished city status to become a district), etc.  
- These indicate a clear focus on **administrative boundaries and legal归属 (affiliation)** as the key framework for understanding the region’s identity.  
- No mention of language, culture, family roots, or social networks is made in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author constructs a narrative that defines the identity and status of Huadu through **official administrative changes** over time. There is a strong emphasis on **jurisdictional legitimacy** rather than cultural or familial rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is delineating which areas should or should not be considered part of the ""local"" core, specifically in the context of administrative changes. They point out that certain areas (like the areas of Yuexiu District that had not yet been merged into Dongshan, as well as newly merged areas like Kuangquan Street and Guihuagang) are excluded from what they consider the authentic ""local"" area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific areas not being ""included"" or considered part of the local core despite administrative integration.
- Focus on historical and current administrative boundaries as a way to distinguish ""true local"" areas.
- The phrase “不算进去” (not counted as part of it) indicates a boundary of local identity that does not strictly follow administrative expansion.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not relying on current administrative boundaries to define local identity. Instead, they are using a shared or habitual perception of which areas ""really count"" as part of the local space, even if they have since been administratively merged. This reflects a habitual, culturally recognized spatial boundary rather than a legal or administrative one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author describes their upbringing in Henan and their possession of a rural accent from Panyu Shunde, indicating a self-awareness of being perceived as an outsider due to their linguistic and regional background. This implies a belief that speaking local dialects or accents is a key criterion for being seen as a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我小时候一直在河南住"" (I grew up in Henan) indicates the author's non-local origin.  
- ""满口番禺顺德乡下口音"" (speaking with a rural accent from Panyu Shunde) highlights linguistic-cultural recognition as a marker of identity.  
- ""乡下仔来的"" (from the countryside) adds a layer of social perception but does not serve as the main criterion for local identity in this context.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly accepts that their accent—specifically not matching the local speech norms—marks them as non-local. This shows that the author sees linguistic-cultural recognition (specifically accent) as a key factor in how they are judged or perceived by others in terms of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The phrase ""从来没有怀疑过自己"" (""never doubted myself"") reinforces the author's confidence in their local identity, grounded in these social and material foundations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **祠堂 (ancestral hall):** Symbolizes deep family and cultural roots in the area.  
- **分红 (dividends):** Indicates participation in local economic or community systems, implying embeddedness in the local social structure.  
- **有地 (owning land):** Represents material and legal connection to the land, often associated with long-term local belonging.  
- **从来没怀疑过自己 (never doubted myself):** Shows the author's internal certainty about their local identity, supported by the above factors.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements together illustrate the author's belief that having deep social, economic, and familial integration into the local community—such as through ancestral heritage, land ownership, and participation in local benefits like dividends—forms the foundation of a stable and unquestionable local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author expresses a strong sense of local belonging and identity rooted in community-based resources and traditions. They mention ""yearly dividends"" and ""ancestral halls (祠堂)""—both of which indicate long-standing ties to a local collective, such as a village or community with shared lineage or land rights. The fact that they ""sometimes have to go to the ancestral hall to eat"" further emphasizes embeddedness in local customs and social structures.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Yearly dividends"" (年年有分红) suggests economic integration and entitlement within a local community, likely tied to land or collective ownership.
- ""Ancestral hall"" (祠堂) is a strong cultural and familial symbol, indicating generational rootedness and a shared local tradition.
- The habitual nature of these practices (""sometimes have to go"") implies a stable, embedded local identity rather than a transient or external one.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements collectively convey a sense of deep social and economic integration within a local community. The author uses these as indicators of belonging, not just as background information, but as evidence of their stable and recognized position within the local social structure.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and implicitly defines ""local identity"" through long-term integration into local social networks, entitlement to local resources (dividends), and participation in traditional local institutions (ancestral hall).

我战友台山阿伯，十几岁才入户大石那边，但是也一样有分红，不知道他们家怎么操作的,RL6,"  
The author is expressing mild surprise or curiosity about a specific case — a comrade's family (台山阿伯) who only officially registered (入户) in the Dashi area in their teens but still enjoys local benefits such as dividends. This implies an implicit recognition that **such benefits are typically tied to deeper local social or administrative inclusion**, and the author seems to acknowledge this as a meaningful or notable standard for local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""十几岁才入户"" (registered户口 at teenage age) — indicates relatively late administrative integration, but still accepted.
- ""一样有分红"" (still gets dividends) — points to local economic or community benefits tied to social embeddedness.
- ""不知道他们家怎么操作的"" (don’t know how their family managed it) — suggests that such inclusion is not automatic and usually requires certain conditions or connections.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that **dividends or community benefits** are a marker of local embeddedness or recognition, and their surprise at this case suggests that such inclusion is **not automatic**, but rather dependent on certain criteria like local registration, social connections, or community acceptance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses or at least recognizes **dividends and local benefits** as indicators of local social embeddedness and legitimacy, even in cases of relatively late integration.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is expressing a clear view on what defines being ""Guangzhou"" (老广) versus being considered ""Chinese"" (and thus, not truly ""local Guangzhou"") based on language ability. Despite being born and raised in Guangzhou, the author feels their children are not ""Guangzhou people"" because they don't speak Cantonese (""白话""). Meanwhile, the author considers their Zhejiang-born spouse, who learned to speak standard Cantonese and lived in Guangzhou for over 20 years, to be a ""老广."" This reflects a strong emphasis on **linguistic-cultural recognition** as the key standard for defining local identity.

- ""我先生...一口标准白话...已经系老广"" (""my husband... speaks standard Cantonese... is already a 老广"") — reinforces language as the decisive factor.  
- Birthplace and upbringing are mentioned but are **not** treated as decisive criteria by the author.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **explicitly** uses **language proficiency in Cantonese** as the **primary and decisive** standard for determining whether someone is considered a ""Guangzhou person"" or not. This overrides birthplace and upbringing, which are treated as secondary or irrelevant. The author is clearly endorsing this standard and using it to define local identity boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **Birth and upbringing in Guangzhou** are **not endorsed** by the author as sufficient for being considered a ""Guangzhou person.""  
- **Speaking Cantonese (白话)** is **explicitly endorsed** as the **core criterion** for being considered ""local"" (老广).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author defines ""local identity"" based on the ability to speak the local dialect (Cantonese), and uses this to distinguish between who is and is not considered a ""true"" local.

一直系屋企都讲，但自从两个仔上托儿所之后，他们就不讲白话了，宜家最多识听唔识讲，呢个现象我身边几个广州朋友都深受其害,RL4,"  
The author is expressing concern about a language shift in their family and among their Guangzhou friends — specifically, that children no longer speak Cantonese (白话) after entering daycare. While the children may still understand it, they no longer actively speak it. This reflects a weakening of linguistic-cultural continuity and a loss of Cantonese as a marker of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""一直系屋企都讲"" (We always speak Cantonese at home) — indicates an effort to maintain linguistic-cultural identity in the private sphere.  
- ""两个仔上托儿所之后，他们就不讲白话了"" (After the kids started daycare, they stopped speaking Cantonese) — implies that external environments are influencing linguistic shift.  
- ""宜家最多识听唔识讲"" (Now they can understand but can't speak) — shows a partial loss of the language.  
- ""呢个现象我身边几个广州朋友都深受其害"" (Several Guangzhou friends are deeply affected by this phenomenon) — suggests this is a broader issue among locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is highlighting the decline of Cantonese usage among the younger generation, even within families that use it at home. This implies that linguistic-cultural recognition — the ability to speak and transmit the local dialect — is a key component of being a ""local"" person in Guangzhou. The author seems to view this shift as a loss or threat to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the importance of speaking Cantonese as a marker of local identity and expresses concern over its decline. Although the author does not explicitly say ""Cantonese defines who is local,"" the tone and framing strongly suggest that the erosion of the language affects the preservation of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author is emphasizing the role of dialect (Cantonese) in defining and maintaining local identity, and expressing concern over its weakening transmission.

Output: RL4"
真系讲白话，好滴，吹水都方便好多割，普通话少小小味道，哈哈哈哈,RL4,"  
The author expresses a clear preference for speaking Cantonese (""讲白话""), indicating that it facilitates casual conversation (""吹水"") and implies that using Putonghua (Mandarin) carries a slight sense of being ""less authentic"" or less familiar. The tone is informal and rooted in local linguistic identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""讲白话"" (speaking Cantonese) is the central linguistic feature.
- ""普通话少小小味道"" (Mandarin lacks a bit of flavor) implies a cultural or emotional preference for Cantonese.
- The overall sentiment reflects linguistic-cultural recognition as a marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses language preference—specifically the use of local dialect—as a marker of cultural closeness and local identity. The tone suggests that speaking Cantonese enhances a sense of belonging and ease of interaction, which is central to defining ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of Cantonese as a marker of local identity and implies that this linguistic feature contributes to a sense of being ""local"" or culturally rooted.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses dialect preference and cultural speech habits as implicit criteria for defining local identity.

我屋企坚持讲白话。虽然我个囡白话都唔多好，起码我哋坚持要距讲，无人迁就距，所以距一直都係同我哋用白话沟通。,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that their family insists on speaking Cantonese (""白话"") at home. Even though their daughter's Cantonese is not very good, the family does not make accommodations and insists on using Cantonese in communication. This reflects the author's belief that speaking the local dialect is an important marker of local identity and should be actively maintained.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""坚持讲白话"" (insist on speaking Cantonese) indicates a deliberate effort to maintain a linguistic trait.
- ""囡白话都唔多好"" (daughter's Cantonese not very good) shows that fluency is not the main point—**consistent use** of the dialect is.
- ""无人迁就距"" (no one accommodates her) emphasizes the importance of maintaining the linguistic norm.
- ""一直都係同我哋用白话沟通"" (has always communicated with us in Cantonese) shows that linguistic practice is central to family and identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a strong statement about **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a boundary marker of identity. The insistence on speaking Cantonese—even when inconvenient or imperfect—shows that the author sees this as essential to being part of the local cultural group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses** the use of local dialect as a standard for maintaining and transmitting local identity. This is not just a descriptive statement—it is a **prescriptive** one about how local identity should be preserved through language.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author explicitly uses the **use of local dialect** as a defining criterion for maintaining local identity within the family.

Output: RL4"
外地人大把会讲白话呀，特别是广西老表和湖南老表最多人,(none),"  
The author acknowledges that many non-local people (外地人) can speak Cantonese (白话), especially people from Guangxi (广西老表) and Hunan (湖南老表). While the tone is descriptive, the underlying implication is that speaking the local dialect is not exclusive to ""locals"" and therefore may not be a reliable criterion for distinguishing ""true locals.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""会讲白话"" (can speak Cantonese) directly relates to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- ""外地人"" (non-locals) indicates a boundary between ""us"" and ""them"" in terms of local identity.  
- Mention of specific regional groups (""Guangxi laobiao"" and ""Hunan laobiao"") adds a layer of social categorization.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not affirming the use of dialect as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they are **challenging** or **undermining** the idea that speaking the local dialect (Cantonese) equates to being a local, by pointing out that many non-locals also speak it fluently.  
This implies a **rejection** of RL4 as a valid or sufficient criterion for defining ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) is mentioned, the author **does not endorse** it as a valid standard for defining local identity. Instead, they use it to illustrate that dialect is not a reliable marker of local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **does not endorse** any RL category as a standard for defining ""local identity"" in this text, and is in fact **questioning** one (RL4), **no RL label should be assigned**.

Output: (none)"
我觉得唔紧要啊，起码人地真的学起来了，不是现在很多不友好的外地人，你一说白话，对方就一副妹仔大过主人婆的样子叫你讲普通话,RL4,"  
The author expresses a positive attitude toward people making the effort to learn and use the local dialect (Cantonese/白话). They contrast this with the behavior of some ""unfriendly non-locals"" who, upon hearing the local dialect, demand that others switch to Mandarin (普通话), often in a condescending manner. The author implicitly criticizes this behavior and values the willingness to use the local language as a sign of respect and integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""人地真的学起来了"" (others are really starting to learn) shows appreciation for efforts to integrate linguistically.  
- ""你一说白话，对方就一副妹仔大过主人婆的样子叫你讲普通话"" (when you speak Cantonese, others act condescendingly and tell you to speak Mandarin) highlights linguistic conflict and the use of language as a boundary marker.  
- The author implies that speaking the local dialect is a marker of local belonging, and that being open to it is a positive trait.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is advocating for linguistic-cultural recognition as a meaningful way to define who belongs locally. They criticize those who reject local language use and suggest that learning and using the local dialect is a better path to coexistence.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of local dialect (Cantonese) as a positive cultural-linguistic trait and implicitly rejects the idea that Mandarin should be enforced in local settings. This aligns with using linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for local belonging.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses language (specifically, the use or willingness to use the local dialect) as a key criterion for defining local identity and evaluating social behavior.

Output: RL4"
祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的，跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系。你逻辑都搞不清楚,RL3,"  
The author is emphasizing a clear standard for defining who is a ""true"" Guangzhou person — having one's name recorded in the ancestral hall (祠堂). This is presented as the **fundamental** criterion, overriding other actions like visiting a cultural site (陈家祠). The tone is assertive and evaluative, indicating the author strongly endorses this standard.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祠堂有你的名字"" (having your name in the ancestral hall) — implies generational family ties and rootedness.  
- ""才算是广州人"" (only then are you considered a Guangzhou person) — directly defines local identity through family-rooted cultural practice.  
- ""跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系"" (has nothing to do with whether you visit a cultural site) — contrasts symbolic cultural participation with actual rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses ancestral hall inclusion as a **definitive boundary** for local identity — not just cultural participation or administrative status. This reflects a deep-rooted, lineage-based logic for defining who belongs as a ""real local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** family-rootedness (specifically, having one's name in the ancestral hall) as the **basic** standard for being considered a Guangzhou person.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, which defines local identity based on generational depth of family settlement, lineage, or long-term familial ties to the area.

陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,RL6**,"  
The author uses colloquial Cantonese to express that one's involvement or concern with **Chen Clan Ancestral Hall (陈家祠)** — a culturally and historically significant local site — depends on whether one has **tangible social or economic stakes**, such as **dividends (分红)** or ancestral ties. If one does not benefit materially or relationally from it, then it is irrelevant to them (""冇就过主啦"" — if not, then move on).  

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""分红"" (dividends):** Implies economic or social stake rooted in local community structures (e.g., village collectives, ancestral clans).  
- **""关你事"" (has to do with you):** Suggests a standard of relevance or belonging that hinges on embedded local assets or relationships.  
- **Implicit reference to lineage or clan membership:** Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is historically tied to kinship and ancestral heritage.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not merely describing economic status or indifference**, but is **defining who counts as having a legitimate connection to the local cultural institution** based on **tangible local social or economic embeddedness** — such as clan membership or entitlement to dividends. This reflects a **criterion for local belonging or identity**, not just property or convenience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **possession of local social assets (like clan ties or dividend rights)** determines whether something is relevant to one's local identity or not. This is not a critique but a **cultural observation or norm** accepted by the speaker.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author uses **local economic or social stakes (e.g., clan dividends)** as a **criterion for defining relevance and belonging to the local cultural space**, which is integral to local identity.

The author is expressing skepticism or detachment from traditional family-rootedness markers such as ancestral graves, clan genealogies (族谱), and ancestral halls (祠堂). They point out that their family no longer actively participates in these traditions, noting that most族谱 were recompiled after reforms and that their ancestors, though from the same surname group in a village, do not share a祠堂 or祭祀 tradition beyond a few generations. This reflects a weakening or rejection of traditional lineage-based definitions of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""我们家早不搞这些了"" (Our family no longer does these things) indicates a break from traditional family-rooted practices.
- ""族谱都是改革后再集资重修的"" (genealogies were mostly recompiled after reforms) implies that the continuity of family history has been disrupted.
- ""阿公阿婆那边以前还算地主"" (my paternal grandparents were once landlords) and ""恨不得断绝关系"" (tried to cut ties) show a historical break in family identification for survival reasons.
- ""祠堂又不是我们家这边的"" (the ancestral hall doesn’t belong to our branch) and ""拜山都只拜到太公那代"" (we only pay respects up to the great-grandfather generation) indicate a limited ancestral lineage.
- ""不是大宗族哪里来的祠堂"" (without being a major clan, where would there be a祠堂) further emphasizes the author's view that their family does not belong to a long-standing, cohesive ancestral group.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is essentially **rejecting** the idea that long-term family rootedness or ancestral continuity defines local identity. They emphasize historical and social disruptions to traditional lineage, and the lack of institutional or ritual continuity (e.g., no祠堂, limited genealogical memory), which implies that family-rootedness is not a viable or meaningful standard for defining ""local"" identity in their view.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- The author **does not endorse** RL3 (Family Rootedness) as a valid or meaningful standard for defining local identity.
- They **reject or downplay** the relevance of generational continuity, ancestral memory, and clan identity.
- Therefore, **RL3 is not applicable** in this case because the author is **not using** family rootedness to define ""local people"" — instead, they are arguing against its relevance.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The text does not support any RL category as the author is **not endorsing any standard** to define ""local identity."" They are **disengaging from traditional lineage-based identity markers**, and no RL element is being used to affirm or construct a local identity standard.

错了，广州城系西至西门口，东至东山口，北至小北，南至南关，加上西关东山三元里河南四区。大部分有分红的村都唔系广州。,RL1,"  
The author is correcting a geographical misunderstanding, defining the ""real"" or ""core"" Guangzhou city area using traditional spatial boundaries—西门口 (West Gate), 东山口 (Dongshankou), 小北 (Xiaobei), 南关 (Nanguan), and key districts like 西关 (Xiguan), 东山 (Dongshan), 三元里 (Sanyuanli), and 河南 (Hedong). The author also implies that many villages with dividend rights are **not** considered part of ""true"" Guangzhou, suggesting a symbolic spatial boundary that differs from administrative or economic definitions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Use of historically recognized landmarks and districts to define the ""core"" Guangzhou area.  
- Reference to ""分红的村"" (villages with dividends) to contrast with what the author considers ""true"" Guangzhou.  
- Emphasis on traditional, socially accepted spatial definitions rather than administrative or economic ones.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is asserting a **socially habitual and historically sedimented** understanding of what constitutes the ""real"" Guangzhou—based not on administrative boundaries or economic benefits, but on **shared, traditional spatial认知** (cognition). This reflects a **symbolic map of local identity**, where certain areas are culturally recognized as the heart of Guangzhou, and others—despite administrative or economic status—are not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a **traditional, socially shared spatial认知** as the standard for defining who or what counts as ""true"" Guangzhou or ""local"" Guangzhou identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author uses **historically sedimented, socially habitual spatial认知** to define the boundaries of ""local"" identity in Guangzhou.

The author challenges traditional notions of ""local identity"" in Guangzhou. They argue that while historically villagers were seen as ""country people"" by old Cantonese residents, the process of suburban urbanization has reversed this dynamic — villagers now often enjoy higher living standards than old urban residents. The author suggests that speaking Cantonese is now the main practical criterion for being accepted as a ""Guangzhou person."" They also reject more restrictive definitions of local identity that emphasize ancestral lineage (e.g., ancestral halls) or residence in the old three districts, pointing out that very few people actually meet those criteria.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""村民"" (villagers), ""郊区城镇化"" (suburban urbanization), ""生活水平"" (living standards)** – suggest a shift in economic status and social rootedness.  
- **""会粤语"" (can speak Cantonese)** – linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- **""祠堂分红"" (ancestral hall and dividends)** – implies family rootedness and social embeddedness.  
- **""老三区"" (old three districts)** – reflects vernacular spatial authority and historical prestige.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** the use of RL3 (family rootedness), RL6 (social embeddedness via community assets like ancestral halls and dividends), and RL1 (historical prestige of the old urban core) as valid or realistic criteria for defining ""local identity"" in contemporary Guangzhou. Instead, they **endorse** the use of **RL4 (linguistic-cultural recognition)** — specifically, **Cantonese fluency** — as the **main practical marker** of being considered a ""Guangzhou person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly **rejects** RL1, RL3, and RL6 as outdated or unrealistic standards.  
They **endorse** the use of **RL4** — language ability (speaking Cantonese) — as the **main criterion** for local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the **RL4** logic: the author believes that **speaking Cantonese** is now the **most widely accepted standard** for being considered a ""Guangzhou person,"" replacing older, more restrictive criteria.

The author is expressing confusion or mild criticism about a common perception: that only people who have **village dividends** and **ancestral halls (祠堂)** can be considered ""true locals"" or ""土著"" (indigenous/local people). They mention a classmate from Chigang village whose hometown is in Sanshui, and they seem to question the logic behind using such criteria to define who is a ""real local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""赤岗d村民"" (a villager from Chigang) – geographical identity.
- ""乡下系三水"" (hometown is in Sanshui) – ancestral/family rootedness.
- ""有分红"" (has dividends) – economic/social embeddedness.
- ""祠堂"" (ancestral hall) – cultural/family rootedness.
- The author is **questioning** the idea that these factors are necessary to be considered ""土著"" (a true local).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is **not endorsing** the criteria of having dividends or ancestral halls to define local identity. Instead, they are **questioning or resisting** this logic. The text reflects a **rejection** of certain RL6 (social embeddedness) criteria that others use to define ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author does **not endorse** the criteria of ""having dividends"" or ""having an ancestral hall"" as valid standards for defining local identity. They are **critical or doubtful** of this logic. Therefore, **no RL category should be annotated**, because the author is not using any of the criteria to define local identity themselves — they are pointing out the strangeness of others' views.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
Although the text mentions elements related to RL3 (family rootedness) and RL6 (social embeddedness), these are part of a belief system that the author is **questioning**, not endorsing. Since the task only annotates criteria **endorsed by the author**, and none are present here, **no RL label applies**.

The author expresses confusion and irony about being judged as ""not a real Guangzhou person"" due to the absence of a clan ancestral hall (""祠堂""). They list several criteria that they believe should qualify them as a local Guangzhou person: long family history in Guangzhou (at least known for several generations), hukou (ID code 4401), speaking Cantonese, living in a village with dividend rights, and being part of a local rural community. The author mocks the idea that a single symbolic cultural marker — having a clan ancestral hall — should override all these other indicators.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** ""我屋企对上几代都系广州"" (my family for several generations has been in Guangzhou) — generational family history.  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** ""身份证4401"" (ID number starting with 4401, indicating Guangzhou hukou) — legal-administrative belonging.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** ""一直都系讲粤语"" (always speak Cantonese) — linguistic-cultural identity.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** ""住村度有分红"" (live in a village and receive dividends) — local social-economic integration.  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** ""成村都冇祠堂"" (the whole village doesn’t have a clan hall) — shared local spatial identity that contradicts outsider judgment.  
- **RL7 (Occupational Typification):** Not present.  
- **RL5 (Functional Livability):** Not present.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author lists multiple criteria they personally meet — family history, administrative belonging, linguistic-cultural practice, and social-economic integration — to argue that they should be considered a local. The author is responding to an external standard (RL1-based or symbolic cultural marker — having a clan hall) that excludes them and their entire village. The author implicitly resists this external standard but still acknowledges its social prevalence in defining ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** and **uses to define their own local identity** the following standards:  
- Family rootedness (RL3)  
- Administrative legitimacy (RL2)  
- Linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)  
- Social embeddedness (RL6)  

The author also **mentions** a vernacular spatial identity (RL1) — that their whole village lacks ancestral halls — but this is used more to show the absurdity of an external standard, not to affirm a local identity standard they personally endorse.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author clearly endorses multiple standards for defining local identity:  
- **RL2:** ID number shows administrative belonging.  
- **RL3:** Family history of several generations in Guangzhou.

The author is asserting their identity as a ""Guangzhou person"" based on having been ""born and raised here"" (土生土长), even though they came to Guangzhou as an infant. They explicitly express pride in identifying as a Guangzhou person, emphasizing that long-term upbringing and life experience in the city are sufficient to establish local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) – indicates deep personal rootedness in the area.  
- ""刚满月就随父母来广州定居"" (settled in Guangzhou right after one month old) – emphasizes early and long-term presence in the city.  
- ""在广州长大几十年"" (grew up in Guangzhou for decades) – reinforces the personal history and integration into the local environment.  
- ""自豪地是说自己是广州人"" (proudly call myself a Guangzhou person) – affirms self-identification based on lived experience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending their claim to local identity based on having lived in Guangzhou for their entire life, even if not born there. They are emphasizing that long-term upbringing and integration into the city's social fabric are sufficient to be considered a ""local person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised"" in a place (or arriving at a very young age and growing up there) is a valid and sufficient basis for claiming local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author uses their long-term personal history and upbringing in Guangzhou (even if not born there) as the basis for claiming local identity. The phrase ""土生土长"" and the emphasis on growing up in Guangzhou strongly point to this category.

They distinguish between ""true Guangzhou people"" (三代以内), ""new Guangzhou people"" (二代以内), ""Guangzhou immigrants"" (一代开荒牛), and even ""Guangzhou people from other provinces"" (三代都不讲广州话), based on **family lineage** and **language use across generations**. The core argument is that **family rootedness over multiple generations** determines the authenticity and depth of local identity.

- ""二代以内"" (within two generations)  
- ""一代开荒牛"" (first-generation pioneers)

These all point to **family historical rootedness** as the key standard for defining ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **generational depth** of family settlement to establish a hierarchy of local belonging—from ""true"" to ""immigrant"" to ""externally rooted."" This reflects a belief that **long-term family presence in the area** is the foundational criterion for being considered ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is caught between **administrative criteria** (hukou determines official local status) and **cultural/familial criteria** (growing up in Guangzhou, speaking the language, and being recognized as such by family). The author implicitly questions the legitimacy of using administrative boundaries alone to define ""local people"" and seems to lean toward endorsing the cultural and historical rootedness standards. Their personal narrative supports the idea that upbringing, language, and family perception are valid or even more authentic ways to define local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses:
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** They were born and raised in Guangzhou.
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** They speak fluent Cantonese.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** Mentioned, but the author seems to resist this as the **sole** determinant of local identity.

Since the task is to annotate **only the criteria the author endorses** (not those they resist or question), we exclude RL2. The author's narrative affirms identity through upbringing and language.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3:** The author grew up in Guangzhou, which forms the basis of their emotional and experiential connection to the city.
- **RL4:** The author speaks fluent Cantonese, which is a cultural marker of being ""local"" in Guangzhou.

Output: RL3, RL4"
首先你会讲白话吗？,RL4,"  
The author is asking whether the person being addressed speaks Cantonese (白话), which implies that speaking the local dialect is a relevant criterion for determining whether someone is considered a local. Although this is a question rather than a full statement, the underlying assumption is that language proficiency is a standard for defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""讲白话"" (speak Cantonese) directly relates to linguistic-cultural recognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The question implies that speaking the local dialect is a prerequisite or important marker for being considered a local. This aligns with the idea that linguistic-cultural traits are used to distinguish insiders from outsiders.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is asking a question rather than making a full assertion, the question itself reflects an implicit assumption that speaking the local language is a relevant standard for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL4, as it uses linguistic-cultural recognition—specifically, speaking the local dialect—as a potential criterion for defining ""local identity.""

Output: RL4"
广州本地人指的是:1，村里有祠堂（族谱） 2，有分红,"RL3, RL6","  
The author explicitly defines what it means to be a ""Guangzhou native"" according to two specific criteria: (1) having ancestral roots in a village, indicated by the presence of a clan hall and family genealogy, and (2) receiving village dividends. These are presented as **standards for defining local identity**, not just background information or personal opinion.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""村里有祠堂（族谱）"" (has a clan hall and genealogy in the village): This indicates **family historical rootedness** and long-standing ties to the local area.  
- ""有分红"" (receives village dividends): This reflects **embedded local social and economic status**, such as access to collective village resources, which often implies recognized local belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Both criteria serve as **objective markers** used by the author to define who qualifies as a ""true local"" in Guangzhou.  
- The clan hall and genealogy establish **ancestral legitimacy** and generational continuity.  
- Receiving dividends implies **formal recognition and integration into local social and economic systems**, such as rural collective ownership structures.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** both family rootedness and social-economic embeddedness as **standards for defining local identity**. These are not described as others' opinions or criticized; they are directly presented as the criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly applicable due to the emphasis on ancestral lineage, clan halls, and genealogy as the basis for local identity.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is also applicable because the author includes village dividends—a form of local social and economic integration—as a standard for being considered ""local.""

Output: RL3, RL6"
我认为的，如果户口是那就是啊 广州居民，不是老广（老广指村里有分红的）；新广就是买房定居广州（新入户广州的）,RL2,"  
The author clearly expresses their view on what defines a ""Guangzhou resident"" — it is based on **hukou (household registration)**. They distinguish between ""老广"" (old Guangzhou people, who have village dividends and generational roots), and ""新广"" (new Guangzhou people, who have recently moved in and bought property), using administrative legitimacy as the key criterion.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""如果户口是那就是啊"" (If the hukou is there, then that's it) — clearly points to **administrative legitimacy**.
- ""老广"" — refers to those with generational roots and local benefits (RL3 and RL6), but the author **explicitly distinguishes** themselves from this definition.
- ""新广就是买房定居广州（新入户广州的）"" — refers to people who have newly moved in and registered their **hukou** in Guangzhou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **explicitly rejects** lineage, property ownership, or cultural integration as the core standard for being considered a Guangzhou resident. Instead, they **endorse hukou registration** as the **definitive criterion** for defining ""local people"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only **hukou-based legitimacy** is endorsed by the author as the standard for defining local identity in this statement.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author explicitly uses hukou registration as the defining standard for who counts as a ""Guangzhou resident.""

错了，广州城系西至西门口，东至东山口，北至小北，南至南关，加上西关东山三元里河南四区。大部分有分红的村都唔系广州。,RL1,"  
The author is correcting a geographical misconception by defining the ""real"" or ""core"" area of Guangzhou based on traditional spatial boundaries—using landmarks like 西门口, 东山口, 小北, 南关, and mentioning the historically recognized districts of 西关, 东山, 三元里, and 河南. The author also implies that many villages with dividend rights (often rural administrative villages) are not considered part of the ""true"" Guangzhou, likely because they fall outside this symbolic core area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Use of traditional landmarks and historical districts to define the ""true"" Guangzhou: 西门口, 东山口, 小北, 南关, 西关, 东山, 三元里, 河南.  
- Reference to villages with dividend rights (分红的村) being excluded from the author's definition of ""Guangzhou.""  
- Implied social consensus on what constitutes the core urban area versus peripheral or rural areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a historically sedimented, socially shared perception of Guangzhou’s core spatial boundaries to define who or what belongs to ""real Guangzhou."" The exclusion of villages with dividend rights further reinforces this boundary based on cultural and spatial cognition rather than administrative or economic criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a socially habitual and historically rooted understanding of urban spatial boundaries to define local identity. This is not based on administrative lines (RL2), economic function (RL5), or social networks (RL6), but on shared cultural geography.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, where the author uses traditional, socially accepted spatial definitions to determine who or what counts as part of the ""local"" city.

Output: RL1"
边个话你知老广就有分红，有分红都是村镇的，老广是住市区的,RL6,"  
The author is making a distinction between different types of ""老广"" (Guangzhou locals), arguing that those who receive **dividends** are typically from **villages or towns**, whereas **true urban Guangzhou locals** (老广) live in the **city center**. This reflects a **hierarchical distinction** within ""local identity"" based on **social embeddedness**, particularly **economic benefits tied to local land or community membership**, and **residential location**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有分红"" (receive dividends) – refers to economic benefits often tied to rural or village collectives, indicating embeddedness in a local economic structure.  
- ""村镇"" (villages and towns) – contrasts with urban areas, suggesting different types of local belonging.  
- ""老广是住市区的"" (real Guangzhou locals live in the city center) – defines local identity through **urban residential location** and possibly **urban lifestyle**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **distinguishing between different levels or types of ""local"" identity**, using **economic embeddedness** (dividends) and **urban residency** as markers of **authentic or superior local identity**. This implies that **genuine local status** is not just about ancestry or language, but also about **integration into the urban economic and social structure**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that **living in the city center** and **not receiving rural dividends** is a marker of being a **true urban local**, thus using **social embeddedness** in the urban core as a defining standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as the author uses **economic and residential integration into the urban core** as a standard to distinguish between different types of ""local people,"" particularly emphasizing that **true locals are embedded in the city's social and residential fabric**.

Output: RL6"
我是爷爷南下干部过来的，虽然白话习惯都一样，但内心里没有归属感,RL3,"  
The author shares a family migration history—specifically, that their grandfather was a cadre who moved south (""南下干部""). Despite having the same dialect and cultural habits as locals, the author states they still lack a sense of belonging. This reveals a self-awareness of not being perceived (or not perceiving oneself) as ""local"" due to family origin, even in the absence of cultural or linguistic differences.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""爷爷南下干部过来的"" (My grandfather was a cadre who came down from the north) — indicates a family migration history, not rooted in the local area.
- ""白话习惯都一样"" (Same dialect and habits) — implies cultural-linguistic recognition should be present.
- ""内心里没有归属感"" (No inner sense of belonging) — reflects a self-perceived lack of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the author shares the same linguistic and cultural traits as locals (RL4), they feel a lack of belonging, pointing to deeper criteria—specifically, family-rootedness (RL3). The author implicitly endorses the idea that being a ""local"" involves more than just cultural assimilation; it also requires deep generational ties to the place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly conveys that family history and generational rootedness (not just cultural assimilation) are important for feeling like a ""local."" This is not explicitly resisted and is central to the expression of identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author reflects on how family migration history affects their sense of local belonging, even when cultural and linguistic integration is complete.

Output: RL3"
是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗，反正你又没分红,RL6,"  
The author is questioning the significance of the distinction between ""local"" and ""non-local"" identity, pointing out that the listener does not have access to local dividends — a tangible benefit often tied to local social rootedness or collective assets. This implies that the author sees access to such resources as a meaningful marker of local status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) directly refers to material or communal economic benefits typically linked to local community membership.
- The rhetorical question structure implies that the author believes such material benefits are a key component of what is often used to define ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is critiquing or questioning the relevance of ""local"" identity if one does not have access to embedded local resources like dividends. This implies that such resources are a standard others may use to define local belonging, even if the author is skeptical of its importance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is questioning the value of the distinction, they are not denying that ""having dividends"" is a commonly used standard to judge local identity. The author is acknowledging its functional role in defining local belonging, even if they are not personally endorsing it as the only or most important standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as it references ""dividends"" — a form of embedded local asset or social benefit — as a marker of local identity.

Output: RL6"
想是就是，看自己的归属感,(no label),"  
The author expresses a subjective and personal view that ""local identity"" is determined by one's own sense of belonging. The phrase ""想是就是，看自己的归属感"" (If you think you are, then you are; it depends on your own sense of belonging) clearly conveys the idea that the definition of being ""local"" is internal, psychological, and based on personal identification rather than external criteria like geography, administrative status, or family history.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- No explicit reference to geography, administrative boundaries, family roots, language, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupation is made.
- The emphasis is entirely on **self-perception** and **internal sense of belonging**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author rejects external, objective standards for defining ""local identity"" and instead proposes that it is a matter of personal belief and inner identification. This implies a **non-objective, subjective** basis for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL1–RL7 categories are based on internal perception or self-identification alone. All RL categories involve **external, socially or materially grounded criteria** (e.g., administrative status, family history, dialect, etc.). The author’s view goes beyond all these and proposes a **purely psychological or self-defined** standard, which is **not captured by any of the RL categories**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author’s definition of ""local identity"" is entirely subjective and not based on any of the RL criteria, **no RL label applies**.

算啦，是不是本地的重要吗？ 现在粤语都没人讲了，分红也只有村民有,N/A,"  
The author questions the importance of being ""local"" in the current context, pointing out two key observations: the decline of Cantonese usage and the exclusivity of dividends to villagers. These points suggest that traditional cultural-linguistic markers (RL4) and social-economic rootedness (RL6) — both commonly used to distinguish ""local"" identity — are either fading or restricted in relevance. The author implies that these criteria no longer effectively define or reflect ""local"" status in a meaningful or inclusive way.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""粤语都没人讲了"" (""nobody speaks Cantonese anymore"") relates to **linguistic-cultural recognition** (RL4), as language is a key boundary marker for local identity.  
- ""分红也只有村民有"" (""only villagers get dividends"") relates to **social embeddedness** (RL6), as it refers to access to local economic benefits (e.g., village collective dividends), which are often tied to deep-rooted local status or hukou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing these criteria but rather **highlighting their limitations** in contemporary society. The fading use of Cantonese suggests that linguistic identity is no longer a strong or widely applicable standard for defining localness. Meanwhile, the restriction of dividends to villagers implies that social-economic rootedness is becoming more exclusive rather than inclusive, and thus not a reliable or fair standard for defining broader ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author mentions both RL4 and RL6, they are not **endorsing** them as valid standards for defining ""local identity."" Instead, the author seems to **question or resist** their continued relevance or fairness.  
Therefore, **neither RL4 nor RL6 should be annotated**, as the author is not using them to define who is or isn't local, but rather commenting on their decline or exclusivity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text does not present any **endorsed criteria** for defining ""local identity."" The author is **critical or skeptical** of traditional markers like language and village-based economic benefits. Thus, **no RL category applies**.

Output:"
你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。,RL6,"  
The author is expressing that having access to **community dividends** is a key marker of being considered a ""local"" person. The phrase implies a probabilistic but strong link between **economic entitlements rooted in local community membership** and local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""你有分红就是"" (""if you have dividends, then you are"")  
- ""没分红就…有概率不是"" (""if you don't have dividends, then… you might not be"")  
This centers on **dividend rights** as a criterion for determining whether someone is considered a ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing a social phenomenon, but is **endorsing** the idea that **possession of local economic benefits or rights** (such as dividends) functions as a standard for judging local identity. This reflects **embeddedness in local social and economic structures** as a marker of belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **dividend rights** as a standard for defining who is or is not a ""local"" person.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author, as a third-generation family member born and raised in Guangzhou, has always identified as a ""local indigenous person"" (土著). However, they were challenged by villagers with ancestral祠堂 (ancestral halls) who claimed they are not true locals, which caused the author to doubt their own identity. The author reflects on this by mentioning their grandfather's generation as the first to move to Guangzhou for work and settle down, and that their hukou (户口本) still shows a rural address rather than a Guangzhou one, making it hard to refute the claim.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “土生土长的家族第三代” (third-generation family member born and raised here) → RL3 (Family Rootedness)  
- “祠堂的本地村民” (local villagers with ancestral halls) → RL6 (Social Embeddedness / lineage and community roots)  
- “户口本依然显示乡下地名” (hukou still shows a rural address) → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)  
- “自我认同喺广州本地土著” (self-identify as a local indigenous person) → contrasts with others' criteria, implying identity is not just personal but socially and institutionally negotiated

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is grappling with their local identity in the face of competing criteria:  
- They believe their long-term family presence and upbringing in Guangzhou (RL3) qualify them as locals.  
- However, others (villagers with ancestral ties) use deeper social and ancestral embeddedness (RL6) as the standard.  
- The author also acknowledges that administrative hukou status (RL2) does not reflect their self-perceived local identity, further complicating the issue.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **family rootedness** (RL3) as a basis for self-identification as a local.  
They **do not endorse** administrative hukou (RL2) or ancestral village ties (RL6) as the correct standard, but they are **forced to confront** these as external criteria used by others to define ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's **own view** centers on being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here across generations), which clearly aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
Although other RLs are mentioned (RL2 and RL6), they are **not endorsed by the author** as the standard they personally use to define ""local identity."" Instead, they are presented as **external challenges** to the author's self-identity.

The author challenges a narrow definition of ""Guangzhou person"" based solely on administrative or economic criteria (e.g., ""dividends""). Instead, they advocate for a broader, more inclusive understanding of local identity rooted in cultural认同 (recognizing Guangzhou culture) and linguistic competence (speaking Cantonese). They also emphasize family rootedness, noting that many ""urban"" Guangzhou people have been in the city for three generations, even if their ancestral roots are from surrounding cities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""认可广州文化会讲广州话"" (recognizing Guangzhou culture and speaking Cantonese) points to **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- ""三代在广州"" (three generations in Guangzhou) points to **family historical rootedness**.  
- ""分红"" (dividends) is mentioned but **explicitly rejected** by the author as the standard for defining local identity.  
- The author implies a **contrast between traditional administrative or economic definitions** and **cultural/family-based definitions**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a **more inclusive, culturally and historically grounded definition of ""local identity""**. They argue that:
- Speaking the local language and identifying with local culture is sufficient for being considered a local.
- Generational settlement in the city (even if not originally from the urban core) further solidifies local identity.
- Administrative or economic privileges (like dividends) are **not necessary** and **should not be the standard** for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses**:
- Linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4):认同 through language and culture.
- Family historical rootedness (RL3): Generational presence in the city as a basis for local identity.

They **explicitly reject** using economic or administrative criteria (like dividends) to define local identity, so RL6 and RL2 are **not endorsed**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author clearly articulates their personal view on what constitutes being a ""Guangzhou person."" They argue that **hukou (household registration)** in Guangzhou and the **ability to speak Cantonese (白话)**, combined with **cultural identification**, are the key criteria for being considered a Guangzhou native. They also share their family history, indicating that despite ancestral roots in Maoming, they no longer feel connected to that place. The author implicitly rejects the idea that ancestral origin (RL3) or current administrative affiliation (RL2) alone defines local identity, instead emphasizing **cultural-linguistic belonging (RL4)** and **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the endorsed criteria.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **户口在广州** (""hukou in Guangzhou"") – clearly refers to **administrative legitimacy (RL2)**.
- **会讲白话** (""can speak Cantonese"") – points to **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)**.
- **有文化认同** (""have cultural identification"") – reinforces the **cultural dimension** of local identity.
- **祖籍茂名**, **祖上因为打地主走过来**, **已经同茂名那边几乎冇关系** – describes **family rootedness (RL3)** but the author **explicitly rejects** this as defining their identity.

The author is reflecting on their own ""local identity"" as a Guangzhou person. They emphasize that their maternal family is ""世代广州人"" (generations of Guangzhou people), indicating deep family roots in the area. However, due to historical changes (seizure of property, loss of land and village status), they now lack formal or material indicators of local belonging such as ""分红"" (dividends), ""地"" (land), or ""屋"" (house). Despite this, they still personally identify as a Guangzhou person.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""世代广州人"" (generations of Guangzhou people) — indicates long family rootedness.
- ""被没收财产"" (property confiscated), ""无地唔系村民"" (no land, not a villager), ""无分红无地无屋"" (no dividends, land, or house) — indicates loss of material and social assets tied to local belonging.
- ""我爷在广州出世"" (my grandfather was born in Guangzhou) — suggests generational continuity.
- ""我觉得我系"" (I think I am [a Guangzhou person]) — shows personal identification despite lacking formal or material markers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author clearly believes that their family's generational presence in Guangzhou is the core basis for their identification as a ""Guangzhou person."" Although they lack material or administrative markers of local belonging (such as land, housing, or village dividends), they still assert their identity based on ancestral continuity. This shows that family historical rootedness remains the dominant standard in their self-definition of local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** Strongly endorsed. The author explicitly appeals to multi-generational family history in Guangzhou as the basis for their local identity.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** Although the text mentions lacking dividends, land, and housing, the author does **not** endorse these as necessary for being considered local — in fact, they reject this standard by asserting their identity despite lacking them. Therefore, **RL6 is not endorsed** by the author in this context.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The text centers on the idea that multi-generational family continuity in a place is sufficient for defining local identity, even in the absence of material or administrative ties. This aligns clearly with **RL3: Family Rootedness**.

有没有祠堂？有没有地？有没有分红？,RL6,"  
The author is posing a series of rhetorical questions focusing on the presence of ancestral halls, land ownership, and dividend rights. These elements are typically associated with deep social and familial roots within a local community. The tone implies that these factors are important markers of local legitimacy and identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""有没有祠堂？"" (Do you have an ancestral hall?)** — Indicates family historical rootedness and cultural continuity.  
- **""有没有地？"" (Do you have land?)** — Refers to property ownership, often symbolizing long-term local presence and economic integration.  
- **""有没有分红？"" (Do you have dividend rights?)** — Points to embedded social and economic rights within a local community, such as from village collectives or local enterprises.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These questions collectively serve as a checklist or standard for determining whether someone truly belongs to the local community. The author implies that without these elements—ancestral heritage, land, and economic rights—one cannot be considered a ""real local."" These are not just material assets but symbols of deep social embeddedness and local legitimacy.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and invokes these elements as criteria for defining ""local identity."" There is no indication of resistance or criticism toward using these standards; rather, the rhetorical tone suggests agreement with their relevance.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is describing their family's residential and administrative status in relation to Guangzhou. They explain that because their mother is not originally from Guangzhou, they must first register under her household before being able to move to Guangzhou. They also mention living in a祖屋 (ancestral home) on宅基地 (homestead land), participating in village traditions like dragon boat racing, and not receiving village dividends due to their grandfather's work status (converted to urban residency). These details collectively suggest that **hukou (household registration) status, lineage, and village-based social or economic rights** are criteria used to define who is considered a ""local"" in this context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""身份证唔系44010"" (ID number not starting with 44010) – refers to administrative hukou legitimacy.  
- ""阿妈吾系广州宜边"" (mother not originally from Guangzhou) – implies family-rootedness and administrative dependency for local status.  
- ""有村，冇分红"" (has village ties but no dividends) – reflects social embeddedness and economic rights within the local system.  
- ""住祖屋宅基地"" (live in ancestral home on homestead land) – reflects rootedness and land-based connection.  
- ""年年爬龙船"" (dragon boat racing annually) – indicates cultural participation and local identity.  
- ""老豆打啊爷工，要转居民"" (father worked like grandfather, had to become an urban resident) – refers to occupational and administrative changes over time affecting local status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is describing how their family history, administrative status (hukou), and village-based rights (e.g., dividends) affect whether they are considered “locals” with full local legitimacy. While they live in a祖屋 and participate in local customs (dragon boat racing), they are excluded from full local status due to lacking administrative recognition and economic rights.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author implies that **administrative legitimacy (hukou)** and **family rootedness** are key criteria used by the system to define local identity.  
- They also show that **social embeddedness (e.g., dividends, land use rights)** matters for full local recognition.  
- Although cultural participation (dragon boat racing) is present, it's not sufficient for full local status in the author’s view.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The ID number and need to register under the mother’s household reflect administrative hukou-based definitions of local belonging.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author describes family history, ancestral home, and generational shifts in status, which are used to assess local legitimacy.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author emphasizes the importance of village dividends and land rights as markers of full local status, which they lack.

对啊我也想知道我们家在从化的村里有个几百年的祠堂，肯定算从化土著了。但是一几年并入广州之后身份证变了，不知道算不算广州土著。,"RL2, RL3","  
The author is expressing uncertainty about their local identity status after an administrative change. They emphasize that their family has a centuries-old ancestral hall in Conghua village, suggesting a deep family-rootedness. However, after Conghua was incorporated into Guangzhou, they question whether they are now considered ""Guangzhou natives"" or still just ""Conghua natives."" The author is seeking to define their ""local identity"" based on historical family ties and administrative changes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""几百年的祠堂"" (centuries-old ancestral hall) indicates deep family historical roots.
- ""从化土著"" (Conghua native) reflects identity based on family rootedness.
- ""并入广州之后身份证变了"" (after being incorporated into Guangzhou, ID changed) refers to administrative legitimacy.
- ""不知道算不算广州土著"" (don't know if we count as Guangzhou natives) shows the author is evaluating identity change based on both family history and administrative boundary change.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is weighing two standards simultaneously:  
- **Family rootedness** (RL3): The centuries-old ancestral hall implies generational settlement and a strong claim to being ""native.""
- **Administrative legitimacy** (RL2): The change in hukou and ID number after incorporation into Guangzhou raises the question of whether this administrative change alters their local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not reject either standard but is actively questioning how both **family historical rootedness** and **administrative incorporation** affect their local identity. Therefore, both are endorsed as relevant to the definition of ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** applies because the author uses the centuries-old ancestral hall to assert their claim as ""natives.""
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** applies because the author is considering whether the administrative incorporation and resulting ID change redefine their local identity.

Output: RL2, RL3"
这么说吧，广州前段时间村里分分红，你家有吗？没就不算,RL6,"  
The author is using the example of village dividends as a **criterion to judge whether someone truly belongs to the local community**. The rhetorical tone (""你家有吗？没就不算"" — ""Did your family get any dividends? If not, you don't count"") implies that **participation in local economic benefits or community-based resources** is a standard for defining who is considered a ""local person.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""村里分分红"" (village distributes dividends): refers to community-based economic benefits.  
- ""你家有吗？没就不算"" (Did your family get any? If not, you don't count): implies a **socially recognized boundary** of local belonging based on access to such benefits.  
- The logic is that **only those with deep local roots or official status in the community receive such dividends**, and thus are considered ""real locals.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing a phenomenon, but **endorsing the idea that receiving village dividends is a legitimate standard for judging local identity**. This reflects a belief that local identity is not just about residence or birth, but also about **integration into the local social and economic system**, especially in the context of collectively owned resources.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **possession of local social and economic rights or assets (like village dividends)** is a valid standard for defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which includes **community-based resources like dividends**, **local economic rights**, and **social networks** as indicators of deep local integration and identity.

Output: RL6"
我住德政中，无村无分红,RL6,"  
The author states that they live in ""Dezheng Zhong"" (德政中, likely part of Dezheng Road), and emphasizes that they ""have no village, no dividends."" This implies that they are not part of a traditional village collective or community with associated economic benefits (such as rural collective dividends). This self-identification suggests a contrast with people who do have such social or economic ties, possibly to affirm their own status as urban residents or non-villagers.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我住德政中"" (I live in Dezheng Zhong): Indicates residential location, possibly urban.  
- ""无村无分红"" (no village, no dividends): Suggests lack of affiliation with rural collectives or village-based economic structures, which often provide material or symbolic benefits (e.g., dividends, social networks).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the absence of rural collective affiliation and associated benefits to distinguish themselves from those who do have such ties. This implies a boundary being drawn between urban and rural identities, with the author positioning themselves as urban or non-local in terms of rural collective belonging. The statement may also reflect a sense of pride or self-identification with a more ""modern"" or ""urban"" identity, defined in contrast to village-based rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that not having rural collective ties (no village, no dividends) is a defining feature of their identity, possibly in contrast to others who do. This reflects a view that social embeddedness in the form of rural collective affiliation or its absence plays a role in defining local or urban identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author contrasts their lack of rural collective ties (no village, no dividends) with those who have them, suggesting that such embeddedness or its absence can be a marker of identity or belonging.

Output: RL6"
只有广州农村人才算广州人吗我们公司主管是土生土长的广州人，但是一直住在靠近市区，家里也没有分红,RL3,"  
The author is questioning the criteria for being considered a ""Guangzhou person."" They challenge the idea that only rural residents qualify, by pointing out that their supervisor is a ""土生土长的 Guangzhou person"" (born and raised in Guangzhou), even though they live near the city area and their family does not receive dividends. This implies that the author does **not** endorse criteria such as rural residency or economic/social embeddedness (e.g., dividends) as necessary for being considered local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""Only rural people count as Guangzhou people?"" — questions the relevance of rural residency or RL6-type social rootedness.
- ""Born and raised here"" (土生土长) — points to family rootedness or long-term personal growth history.
- ""Always lived near the city area"" — suggests that urban residency is compatible with being a ""true"" local.
- ""Family has no dividends"" — questions whether RL6-type economic/social embeddedness is necessary for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **refuting** the idea that rural residency or economic/social embeddedness (such as receiving dividends) are necessary for being considered a ""true"" Guangzhou person. Instead, they imply that being born and raised in Guangzhou (RL3) is sufficient for being considered local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that being ""born and raised in Guangzhou"" (土生土长) is sufficient to qualify as a ""Guangzhou person,"" regardless of current residence or economic status. They **reject** the idea that RL6 indicators (e.g., rural residency, dividends) are necessary.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3: Family Rootedness, as the author uses the concept of being ""born and raised here"" as the key criterion for defining ""local identity.""

Output: RL3"
有祠堂有族谱没分红，阴公,RL6,"  
The author uses the phrase ""有祠堂有族谱没分红"" (has a clan hall and genealogy but no dividends) to express a sense of irony or dissatisfaction — implying that despite having traditional family roots and historical ties to a place (symbolized by clan structures), the lack of economic or social benefits (such as dividends) negates or diminishes the practical value of that rootedness. The phrase ""阴公"" is a colloquial expression often used to convey a sense of injustice or being wronged.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祠堂"" (clan hall) and ""族谱"" (genealogy) point to **family historical rootedness** (RL3).  
- ""分红"" (dividends) refers to **local social or economic benefits tied to community membership**, which relates to **social embeddedness** (RL6).  
- The contrast between cultural/familial legitimacy and the absence of material benefits highlights the **importance of embedded local assets or rights** in defining who truly benefits from or belongs to the local community.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author contrasts **symbolic markers of local identity** (clan hall, genealogy) with **tangible local benefits** (dividends), implying that **true local belonging may require both cultural legitimacy and material inclusion**. The tone suggests that the absence of the latter undermines the former in practical terms.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **having access to local benefits like dividends** (a form of social embeddedness) is a meaningful criterion for evaluating one's real or practical status as a ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While family roots are mentioned, the author’s emphasis is on **lack of access to local economic benefits** as a key factor in defining or experiencing marginalization from ""local"" status. This aligns most closely with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which includes **local dividends** and **community-based resources** as indicators of belonging and local legitimacy.

The author is negotiating their own ""local identity"" positioning. While they acknowledge that they may not be considered ""authentic locals"" in the most traditional sense, they emphasize that their family has been in Foshan for at least one generation (their grandparents' time), and they personally identify strongly as a ""Foshan person"" or ""local only child."" They also mention traditional practices like returning to the countryside for Qingming, but note that there are no relatives left there, and they personally feel no attachment to the rural hometown.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我爷奶那代已经在佛山"" (my grandparents' generation were already in Foshan) → generational rootedness.  
- ""清明会翻乡下拜山"" (return to the countryside for Qingming rituals) → cultural practice, but not necessarily tied to current identity.  
- ""乡下已经无亲戚"" / ""我对乡下无归属感"" (no relatives left in the countryside / no sense of belonging there) → weakens rural ties.  
- ""我只会认为我是佛山人佛山本地独生女"" (I only consider myself a Foshan person, a local only child in Foshan) → strong self-identification as local.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's argument centers on the idea that although they may not be ""pure-blood"" locals (perhaps due to rural origins or not enough generational depth in the city), they still claim a ""new local"" identity. The key criteria they use are:  
- The presence of **family rootedness across generations in Foshan** (grandparents' generation onwards).  
- A **clear self-identification as a ""Foshan person""** despite weak rural ties.  
- The **absence of rural attachment** reinforces their urban/local identity in Foshan.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses **family historical rootedness in the city** (RL3) as a basis for claiming local identity.  
They also imply a **habitual or socially accepted understanding of who counts as ""local"" in Foshan**, which includes people like themselves—those with generational presence in the city and strong self-identification—even if not ""authentic"" in the most traditional sense. This may also touch on **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**, as the author is negotiating their identity within the symbolic space of Foshan and distinguishing it from rural areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author explicitly mentions that their grandparents' generation was already in Foshan, which they use as a foundation for claiming a ""new local"" identity.  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** Though not explicitly stated, the author's self-identification as a ""Foshan person"" and rejection of rural belonging implies a shared understanding of what areas (urban Foshan) are considered ""local"" and who belongs to that group.

The author is clearly defining what it means to be a ""local person"" in Guangzhou. According to the author, being a local is not about ancestry or generational settlement, but rather about **inner cultural认同 (cultural认同), emotional attachment, and the absence of identity confusion**. Someone who instinctively considers Guangzhou their ""hometown"" when asked, who doesn't feel a need to mentally trace their roots elsewhere, and who embraces local customs (e.g., food, dialect) is considered a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""You consider Guangzhou your hometown in your heart"" → emotional-cultural认同  
- ""Cultural认同"" → explicit mention of cultural认同 as a standard  
- ""Speak the hometown dialect of your grandfather's place"" → implies linguistic-cultural boundary marker  
- ""Don't have doubts about where you're from"" → internal认同 as a marker  
- ""认同 local culture and food"" → cultural认同 and lifestyle integration  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **explicitly rejects** generational rootedness (e.g., mentioning that even someone who speaks their grandfather's dialect and visits their ancestral hometown is *not* considered a local) and instead **centers cultural认同** — especially emotional and psychological认同 of local customs, food, and dialect — as the **core standard** for defining a ""local person."" The author is constructing a model of local identity that is **internally felt and culturally based**, not administratively, linguistically, or ancestrally defined.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses cultural认同** — specifically emotional, psychological, and lifestyle认同 with Guangzhou culture — as the **primary standard** for defining ""local people."" While language is mentioned, it is not the **core** standard in this argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text **best matches RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, though it emphasizes **cultural认同** more broadly (including emotional and lifestyle认同), which is consistent with the broader spirit of RL4 as the boundary marker of ""local"" identity. Although the author **rejects RL3 (family rootedness)** and **RL1 (spatial cognition)**, they **clearly endorse cultural认同**, including emotional identification with local culture, as the standard for being a ""local person.""

判断是否广州本地人，就一个标准，有分红有祠堂有地,RL6,"  
The author clearly presents a standard for judging ""local people"" identity—specifically, whether someone has **dividends**, **ancestral halls**, and **land**. These are not just economic or cultural features, but symbolic markers of deep-rooted social and familial integration into the local community.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有分红"" (has dividends): Indicates access to local collective economic benefits, often tied to village or community membership.  
- ""有祠堂"" (has an ancestral hall): Reflects generational family rootedness and cultural continuity.  
- ""有地"" (has land): Suggests long-term property ownership or rights, often linked to local social status and belonging.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These three elements together represent **deep social embeddedness**—not only in terms of economic participation (dividends, land), but also cultural and ancestral integration (ancestral hall). The author uses them as **key indicators of genuine local belonging**, implying that only those with these local assets and heritage are truly considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses these three indicators as **the** standard for defining ""local people"" identity. They are not just describing phenomena or listing features, but directly proposing a **definition framework** for who counts as a local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text best matches **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author defines local identity based on deep integration into local social structures—through community dividends, ancestral ties (祠堂), and land rights. These are not just economic assets but **symbolic markers of belonging and legitimacy** within the local context.

Output: RL6"
有没有租收？年底有没有分红？,RL6,"  
The author is asking whether there is rental income (""有没有租收？"") and whether there is a year-end dividend (""年底有没有分红？""). These questions center around economic benefits derived from local social assets—specifically, whether the person or family is embedded in a local community that provides such benefits. The implication is that having access to these benefits is relevant to one's local status or integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""租收"" (rental income) suggests property ownership or control, which may indicate local asset integration.  
- ""分红"" (dividends) implies inclusion in a local economic or community structure that distributes collective benefits, often tied to village collectives, community shares, or local economic organizations.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using the presence of rental income and dividends as indicators of whether someone is integrated into the local economic and social structure. These are markers of **social embeddedness**, particularly in contexts where such benefits are only available to those with long-standing local ties, property, or community status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implies that these economic indicators are relevant to judging someone's local identity or integration. They are not just asking about income preference but about whether the person has access to embedded local resources—key markers of being a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as it involves using local economic integration—such as access to rental income and dividends—as a standard for evaluating local identity or belonging.

Output: RL6"
有分红就算吧,RL6,"  
The phrase ""有分红就算吧"" (if there's a dividend, then they count) implies that the author uses the presence of a local economic benefit — specifically, receiving community dividends — as a criterion for recognizing someone as part of the local group. This suggests a belief that access to or participation in local economic privileges defines or confirms one's ""local"" status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红"" (dividends) indicates a form of local economic benefit or right, often tied to rural collectives or urban village communities.
- The phrase implies that such economic participation is a marker of inclusion in the local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the receipt of dividends — a form of embedded local asset or benefit — to determine whether someone is recognized as a legitimate local. This reflects a logic in which local identity is not just cultural or spatial, but also tied to tangible, institutionalized social and economic rights.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that access to local economic benefits (such as dividends) is a standard for defining ""local people"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness), which includes criteria such as community-based resources (e.g., dividend rights), and uses them as a standard to evaluate who is a ""true"" or ""established"" local.

你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞,RL4,"  
The author is emphasizing that the ability (or inability) to speak Cantonese (白话) determines one's status as a ""local"" or outsider. The phrase ""你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞"" roughly translates to ""if you can't speak Cantonese, you can only be considered a local at best in name."" This implies that speaking the local dialect is a key criterion for being truly recognized as a local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""唔识得讲白话"" (can't speak Cantonese) — linguistic marker.
- ""本地捞"" (local at best) — a diminished or contested form of local identity.
- The core idea is that language (specifically, speaking Cantonese) is being used as a boundary marker for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly using linguistic ability — specifically, speaking Cantonese — as the standard by which one's local identity is judged or evaluated. The inability to speak the local dialect results in a lower or incomplete status as a ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that speaking the local dialect (Cantonese) is a key criterion for determining whether someone is truly a local. This is not a resisted or criticized standard — it is presented as a given or norm.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, where dialect or accent is used as a boundary marker for local identity. The author treats the ability to speak the local language as a key determinant of whether someone is genuinely local.

Output: RL4"
咁你识5识讲广州话啊？ 识讲，又无口音咪喺广州人啰,RL4,"  
The author is making a point that speaking Cantonese without a noticeable accent is a key marker of being considered a ""true"" Guangzhou person. The rhetorical question format implies that language fluency and lack of accent are central to local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""识讲广州话啊？"" (Do you speak Cantonese?) — highlights linguistic ability.  
- ""又无口音咪喺广州人啰"" (If you speak it without an accent, then you're a Guangzhou person) — explicitly links accent (or lack thereof) to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using linguistic criteria — specifically, speaking Cantonese fluently and without a non-local accent — as the basis for determining whether someone is considered a ""real"" local. This is not just about communication but about symbolic inclusion or exclusion from the local identity group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses linguistic-cultural recognition — particularly accent and fluency in the local dialect — as the standard for defining ""local people"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author strongly asserts that speaking Cantonese (广州话) is the **essential criterion** for being considered a ""true"" Guangzhou person (广州人). They reject the idea that place of residence, administrative status (e.g., ""new Guangzhou person""), or even local ancestry (e.g., ""native with dividends"") alone is sufficient. The author's tone is **insistent and exclusionary**, using language as the **definitive boundary** for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""我系广州话忠实拥趸""** (""I'm a loyal fan of Cantonese"") — shows strong identification with the language.  
- **""只有识讲广州话既才能算系广州人""** (""Only those who can speak Cantonese can be considered Guangzhou people"") — **explicitly defines** local identity by linguistic ability.  
- **""如果连广州话都吾识讲，仲点好意思话自己系广州人？""** (""If you can't even speak Cantonese, how can you have the nerve to say you're a Guangzhou person?"") — **strongly excludes** non-speakers from local identity.  
- **""应该讲自己系中国人""** (""You should just say you're Chinese"") — contrasts local identity (Guangzhou person) with national identity (Chinese), reinforcing that language is what distinguishes the two.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Language (specifically Cantonese) is the **central and exclusive** standard the author uses to define who counts as a ""true"" Guangzhou person. Other factors like residency, administrative status, or even being a local native with material benefits (e.g., dividends) are **explicitly dismissed** by the author as insufficient. The author **strongly endorses** linguistic-cultural recognition as the **sole valid** criterion for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly rejects** other potential standards (e.g., administrative belonging, family rootedness, etc.).  
- The author **explicitly endorses** and **strongly emphasizes** the **use of Cantonese** as the **key marker of Guangzhou local identity**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text **clearly aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author **explicitly defines** who is a ""Guangzhou person"" based on **language use (Cantonese)**. The author **strongly links** linguistic ability to the **exclusive boundary of local identity**, which is the **core identification feature** of RL4.

The author is questioning the definition of ""local identity"" (specifically, whether their son and their friend's daughter are considered ""Foshan people""). They emphasize indicators such as **having dividends**, **having a clan genealogy and ancestral hall**, and **administrative affiliation (hukou)**, while also contrasting this with **actual place of residence and family lifestyle**. This reflects the author's uncertainty about which criteria should be used to define ""local people.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""我老公是佛山本地人，有分红，有族谱，祠堂几百年历史""** (""My husband is a local Foshan person, has dividends, a family genealogy, and ancestral halls with centuries of history"") reflects **RL3: Family Rootedness** (generational ties, clan history) and **RL6: Social Embeddedness** (dividends, social assets).
- **""户口跟我，在我那边出生""** (""My son's hukou is with me, born in my place"") and **""女儿户口在佛山""** (""The daughter's hukou is in Foshan"") refer to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** (hukou as a marker of local identity).
- **""全家回去我们那边生活""** (""The whole family has moved back to our place to live"") introduces a contrast between **actual place of residence** and **hukou-based identity**, but the author does **not explicitly endorse** this as a standard for defining ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author presents multiple standards—**family lineage and clan ties**, **social assets (dividends)**, and **hukou registration**—but questions whether these are sufficient or necessary to define someone as a ""Foshan person."" They do not clearly endorse one standard over another but are **exploring how these elements function in defining local identity**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not clearly endorse** any one standard; rather, they **question the relative importance** of each. However, they **do present** RL2 (hukou), RL3 (family rootedness), and RL6 (dividends and clan assets) as **being used in the broader social context** to define ""local identity."" Since the author does not resist or negate these standards and is actively engaging with them as relevant to the question of local identity, they qualify for annotation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author discusses hukou registration as a potential determinant of whether someone is considered a ""Foshan person.""
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author emphasizes generational ties, clan genealogy, and ancestral halls to indicate deep family roots in Foshan.

However, they also mention having a strong accent from a specific village in Baiyun, which marks them as coming from a particular local background. This reflects both **family rootedness** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** in defining local identity.

- ""从小土生土长"" (born and raised here since childhood) → points to **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
- ""会说流利白话"" (speaks fluent Cantonese) → points to **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.  
- ""很浓的白云某村口音白话"" (speaks with a strong Baiyun village accent) → also points to **RL4**, as it emphasizes accent as a marker of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is explaining what makes someone ""count"" as a local — being born and raised in the area and speaking the local dialect fluently. However, their own strong village-specific accent marks them as a local of a specific type, revealing that both **long-term local upbringing** and **language use** are criteria they endorse for defining ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Both **RL3** and **RL4** are endorsed by the author as standards used to define ""local identity."" There is no explicit resistance to either.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)**, as the author endorses being born and raised locally and speaking the local dialect (with specific accent markers) as part of defining who is a ""local.""

不算，我也是爷爷那一辈来广州定居，父亲和自己都是土生土长的，但是祖宗坟茔和宗祠都在老家。年年都要预留时间回老家扫墓。然后因为是在大院长大，跟本地人的圈子也融不进去，即使自己讲着一口广州话但是就是觉得差了这么一点可能真的只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同。,RL3,"  
The author reflects on their complex relationship with Guangzhou identity. Despite being ""born and raised"" (土生土长) in Guangzhou for two generations, they feel a sense of incomplete local belonging due to the absence of ancestral roots (祖宗坟茔 and 宗祠 remain in the hometown). They also mention difficulties integrating into local social circles and a perceived cultural gap, even though they speak Cantonese fluently. The author implies that true Guangzhou identity requires ancestral rootedness — that only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou can fully possess a ""Guangzhou person"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""爷爷那一辈来广州定居"" (settled in Guangzhou from the grandfather’s generation) → indicates a migration history.  
- ""父亲和自己都是土生土长的"" → personal rootedness in Guangzhou.  
- ""祖宗坟茔 and 宗祠都在老家"" → family historical rootedness elsewhere.  
- ""年年都要回老家扫墓"" → continued ancestral connection and obligation.  
- ""在大院长大，跟本地人的圈子融不进去"" → limited social embeddedness.  
- ""即使讲着一口广州话，但就是觉得差了这么一点"" → linguistic fluency without full cultural认同.  
- ""只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同"" → explicit belief that only those with generational family roots in Guangzhou can truly identify as Guangzhou people.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes that **true local identity (in this case, being a ""real"" Guangzhou person)** depends not just on personal rootedness (being born and raised there), nor even on linguistic-cultural recognition (speaking Cantonese), but on **family historical rootedness** — specifically, having ancestors who were born in Guangzhou and whose graves and ancestral halls are located there. This implies that **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is the author’s endorsed standard for defining ""local identity,"" even though other RL elements are present.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly endorsed: the author believes that only those with ancestral roots in Guangzhou (not just personal upbringing) can truly form a Guangzhou identity.  
- **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** is mentioned but not endorsed as the standard — the author speaks Cantonese but still feels excluded.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is referenced (difficulty integrating into local circles), but the author does not frame it as the **basis** for defining local identity — rather, it is a **consequence** of lacking ancestral roots.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text primarily reflects the author’s belief that **local identity (being a true Guangzhou person)** is defined by **family historical rootedness in the area across multiple generations**, which aligns with **RL3**.

你说我是不是广州人？我爷东莞人，抗日时期跑到广州来定居，我妈是广州农村，然后我户口跟我妈，我妈户口一直在村里，所以我有村分红，但是在村里属于外姓人,"RL2, RL3, RL6","  
The author is questioning their own ""local identity"" — specifically whether they are considered a ""Guangzhou person."" They provide a detailed background: their grandfather was from Dongguan, migrated to Guangzhou during the Anti-Japanese War, their mother is from the rural part of Guangzhou, and the author's hukou (household registration) is with their mother's rural village household. They receive village dividends but are still considered an ""outsider"" (外姓人) in the village.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""我爷东莞人"" (my grandfather was from Dongguan) — indicates family migration history.
- ""我妈是广州农村"" (my mother is from rural Guangzhou) — indicates local rural roots on the maternal side.
- ""我户口跟我妈"" (my hukou follows my mother) — indicates administrative belonging.
- ""我妈户口一直在村里"" (my mother's hukou has always been in the village) — reinforces administrative and social belonging.
- ""所以我有村分红"" (so I get village dividends) — indicates embedded economic rights and social rootedness.
- ""但是在村里属于外姓人"" (but in the village, I'm considered an outsider/外姓人) — indicates a contrast between formal belonging (hukou, dividends) and informal social exclusion (not a local by lineage or clan).

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is exploring the boundaries of ""local identity"" by presenting a complex personal background. They have strong administrative and economic ties to the village (RL2 and RL6), and their family has lived in Guangzhou for multiple generations (RL3). However, they are still excluded from full local identity due to clan or lineage reasons. Despite this exclusion, the author does not explicitly resist or negate the criteria used to define local identity; rather, they seem to accept and reflect on them.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author accepts that hukou (户口) is an important marker of local identity.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author implies generational settlement (grandfather migrated long ago), suggesting a belief that long-term family presence in the area contributes to local identity.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** The author mentions receiving village dividends, indicating a form of embeddedness in the local social-economic system.
- **Exclusion of RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):** Although the author may have local linguistic or cultural traits, these are not mentioned or used as part of their self-identity argument.
- **Exclusion of RL7 (Occupational Typification):** No occupational criteria are used in this argument.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The author implicitly accepts multiple criteria — administrative belonging (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), and social-economic embeddedness (RL6) — as relevant to defining ""local identity."" These are not explicitly resisted and are used in the author's own reflection on whether they are ""truly"" a Guangzhou person.

听讲话无祠堂，非农户口，都有分红,"RL2, RL6","  
The author is describing a person or group who does not belong to a traditional lineage-based community (indicated by ""无祠堂"" – no ancestral hall), holds a non-agricultural hukou (household registration), and yet still receives community dividends. This implies a redefinition or loosening of the traditional criteria for belonging to a local community, especially one where lineage and rural household status once mattered.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""听讲话"" (from the way one speaks): linguistic identification, possibly implying localness through speech habits.  
- ""无祠堂"" (no ancestral hall): suggests lack of traditional family roots or lineage-based belonging.  
- ""非农户口"" (non-agricultural hukou): an administrative classification, indicating urban household status.  
- ""都有分红"" (receives dividends): implies integration into local community economic benefits, suggesting social embeddedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is contrasting traditional markers of local belonging (ancestral halls, rural hukou) with newer, more inclusive markers (non-agricultural status, participation in community economic benefits). The author implicitly accepts that people without traditional roots can still be considered part of the local community if they have administrative recognition and economic integration.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author endorses **non-agricultural hukou** as a valid form of local belonging (RL2: Administrative Legitimacy).  
- The author endorses **dividends** (community economic participation) as a valid form of local belonging (RL6: Social Embeddedness).  
- Although ""听讲话"" (speech) is mentioned, it is not clearly used as a boundary marker for local identity in this context, but rather as an observational tool.  
- ""无祠堂"" is used to highlight deviation from traditional family rootedness, but not as a standard the author endorses for exclusion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author supports the idea that **administrative status** (non-agricultural hukou) and **economic integration** (dividends) are valid criteria for defining who is considered ""local,"" even in the absence of traditional family roots. These align with RL2 and RL6.

无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎。而且广州旧中心城区（清朝时起的城墙位置内）几百年前就无村噶啦。,"RL1, RL2","  
The author is emphasizing that without a city **hukou** (household registration), one does not receive **dividends**—likely referring to collective economic benefits or village-based distributions. Additionally, they point out that the old urban core of Guangzhou (within the ancient city walls dating back to the Qing dynasty or earlier) has not had rural villages for hundreds of years, implying a long-standing urban identity that contrasts with rural or village-based status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎"" (no city hukou means no dividends) points to **administrative legitimacy** and **hukou status** as a defining boundary for access to local benefits and identity.  
- ""广州旧中心城区……几百年前就无村噶啦"" (the old Guangzhou core has had no villages for centuries) implies a **historical and spatial distinction** between urban and rural, reinforcing a sense of **urban rootedness** and **administrative continuity**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a clear boundary between those who are considered part of the **urban local community** (via hukou and historical urban status), and those who are not. The lack of a city hukou excludes one from local benefits and, by implication, from being fully recognized as a ""true local."" The historical note about the absence of villages reinforces that this area has long been defined as urban, and thus has a more ""legitimate"" claim to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **hukou status** as a key standard for defining local identity and access to local benefits. They also reinforce the **historical administrative and spatial legitimacy** of the old urban core as a contrast to rural or village-based status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy (行政归属合法性)** is clearly present — the author defines local belonging through hukou and links it directly to access to local benefits (dividends).  
- **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority (社会习惯性区域认知)** is also present — the author references the historical understanding that the old urban core has long been distinct from rural areas, suggesting a socially accepted boundary of ""urban local"" identity.

我就前几日听一个认识几年噶网友讲话有噶 话距地有一段时间全部农转居，但是都仲有分红。唔记得距系越秀定荔湾了。我都奇怪，因为我地番禺是农户先有分红,RL6,"  
The author is describing a conversation with someone who mentioned that in a certain area (possibly Yuexiu or Liwan), many people who were originally rural residents (""农转居"") still receive community dividends. The author contrasts this with their own experience in Panyu, where only ""农户"" (registered rural households) receive dividends. This implies that the author sees a connection between local social structure, residency status, and access to embedded economic benefits such as dividends.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""农转居"" (rural to urban household conversion) — refers to a change in residency status, which may affect local identity.
- ""分红"" (dividends) — indicates access to local economic benefits tied to social or residential status.
- Mention of specific districts (越秀 Yuexiu, 荔湾 Liwan, 番禺 Panyu) — geographical areas with different local policies or social structures.
- Implied contrast between ""农户"" (rural households) and others in terms of access to local benefits — suggests a hierarchy in local belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is comparing different localities and their treatment of residents in terms of access to social and economic benefits. The core idea is that ""localness"" affects whether one receives community dividends — even those who were once rural residents may retain benefits after conversion, while in other areas (like Panyu), only those with rural household registration originally receive them. This implies that the author sees local identity as tied to access to these embedded resources and social structures.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that access to community dividends and local social networks (e.g., based on residency history or household type) reflects a form of local rootedness and is used to differentiate who is truly ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a logic where local identity is linked to embedded social and economic benefits — such as dividends — which are tied to one's residential or household history. This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author discusses how access to local economic benefits (dividends) and community status are used to define or distinguish local belonging.

我家旧唐楼系大东门附近，幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已。分红真系无。有族谱，但系基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦,RL3,"  
The author is describing their family's long-term rootedness in a specific local area (""我家旧唐楼系大东门附近"") and mentions having lived there since childhood (""幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已""). They also note the absence of dividends (""分红真系无"") and clarify that although there is a clan genealogy (""有族谱""), most people listed are no longer in China (""基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦""). This implies that while there is a historical family connection to the place, it no longer translates into active local embeddedness or benefits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我家旧唐楼系大东门附近"" — indicates a long-standing family residence in a specific local area.  
- ""幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已"" — shows long-term individual presence and growth in the area from early childhood.  
- ""有族谱"" — indicates family lineage and ancestral roots.  
- ""分红真系无"" — suggests lack of current social or economic embeddedness (e.g., community dividends).  
- ""基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦"" — implies that the family’s rootedness is historical but no longer geographically or socially active.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes their family’s historical and generational connection to the area, including long-term residence and the existence of a clan genealogy. These elements suggest that the author sees family rootedness as a meaningful part of local identity, even if current social or economic ties have weakened. The author does not reject this standard but rather presents it as a factual part of their background.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses family rootedness — including long-term family residence and generational ties — as a relevant standard for defining local identity, even if it is not currently active or beneficial.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as the author discusses generational family ties, long-term residence, and ancestral history as part of their identity, even if that history is more symbolic than active today.

Output: RL3"
我都系甘葛情况，我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著,RL6,"  
The author is describing their own identity background in Cantonese, saying something like: ""My situation is like this — me and my father have old connections (老西关系) to Guangzhou people, but we're probably not considered indigenous/local people."" This implies a self-awareness of not being seen as a ""true local"" despite having long-standing social or familial ties to Guangzhou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老西关系"" (old connections to Guangzhou people): suggests deep-rooted social embeddedness or long-standing integration into local networks.
- ""唔系土著"" (not indigenous/local): indicates the author's self-perception or social perception that despite these connections, they are not fully recognized as locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on the boundary between long-term social integration and full local identity recognition. The phrase implies that having long-standing relationships or social ties with locals is an important part of being considered ""local,"" but perhaps not sufficient on its own. This reflects the use of **social embeddedness** — integration into local networks — as a standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that having long-standing social connections with locals (老关系) is relevant to being considered local, but also acknowledges that it may not be enough. Still, the author is framing **social embeddedness** as a meaningful criterion in the local identity discussion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author is discussing long-standing social ties (""老关系"") as part of the standard used — at least partially — to define or aspire to ""local"" identity.

The author is reflecting on what it means to be considered a ""local person"" and argues that **cultural integration**, especially in terms of customs and language, is the key criterion. They describe their family's migration history and the fact that their community maintains a strong cultural connection to their ancestral hometown—through villages, ancestral halls, traditions, and language. Despite living in the area for generations and having some local ties, the author concludes that because they haven't fully integrated into the local culture, **they do not consider themselves ""local people.""**

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""融人当地文化"" (integrate into local culture) — clearly indicates cultural integration as a standard.
- ""过年过节都是按原来的家乡习俗"" (celebrate festivals according to hometown customs) — shows cultural continuity with ancestral traditions rather than local ones.
- ""称呼本地人会说你们本地人"" (refer to locals as ""you locals"") — implies a self-perceived outsider status.
- ""当地语言也会讲，但同村人交流还是用家乡话"" (speak the local language but use hometown dialect among villagers) — highlights linguistic-cultural identity as a boundary marker.
- ""村子，祠堂，祖屋"" (village, ancestral hall,祖屋) — though related to social rootedness (RL6), they are framed here as **symbols of cultural continuity**, not as a basis for claiming local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that physical markers like having a village or祖屋 are sufficient for being considered local. Instead, they **emphasize cultural integration** — especially shared customs and language use — as the **decisive factor** in determining ""local"" identity. The fact that they maintain their own customs and use their hometown dialect among themselves is presented as **evidence of not being local**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- ✅ **Cultural-linguistic integration** is the **explicitly endorsed standard** used to judge whether someone is a ""local.""
- ❌ **Family rootedness (RL3)** is mentioned (migration history,祠堂), but the author **does not use it** to claim local status — instead, it's used to explain why they are **not fully local**.
- ❌ **Social embeddedness (RL6)** elements like villages and祠堂 are present but are **not framed as legitimizing local identity** — they are **contrasted with local integration**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
The author clearly defines ""local identity"" based on **linguistic and cultural integration**, rejecting other criteria like generational settlement or physical community structures. This aligns directly with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.

籍贯广州，广州村民，清明去白云山上拜，几代祖先都在山上，而不是去公共墓园，家庭所有成员粤语完全不带口音,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is emphasizing a deep, multi-generational rootedness in Guangzhou, including familial ties to the land (villager status), ancestral burial practices (several generations buried on Baiyun Mountain rather than in public cemeteries), and linguistic purity (all family members speak Cantonese without accent). These elements collectively serve as the author’s standard for what constitutes a ""true local"" in Guangzhou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""籍贯广州"" (native place is Guangzhou) — indicates family origin and generational connection to the place.  
- ""广州村民"" (Guangzhou villager) — implies rootedness in a specific local social and administrative structure.  
- ""清明去白云山上拜，几代祖先都在山上"" — indicates long-term ancestral presence and ritual practice tied to the local geography.  
- ""家庭所有成员粤语完全不带口音"" — linguistic-cultural rootedness, showing deep integration and no external influence.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
All these elements (ancestral burial, generational continuity, native place, and linguistic purity) are presented as cumulative evidence of deep local belonging. The author implicitly uses these to define what it means to be a ""true local"" — not just by one criterion, but by a combination of family rootedness and cultural recognition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses family rootedness (RL3) and linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as the key standards for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author emphasizes multi-generational presence in Guangzhou, ancestral burial on Baiyun Mountain, and villager status as key markers of local belonging.

我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的，爸爸是潮汕归侨，我广州土生土长我觉得自己只是半个广州人,RL3,"  
The author is expressing a complex sense of local identity. They were born and raised in Guangzhou (""土生土长"") and have a mother with deep family roots in a village in Baiyun District (with a clan hall/ancestral temple), yet they feel like only a ""half Guangzhou person."" This suggests that while they meet certain criteria for local identity (birth, upbringing, family roots), they feel something is still lacking—possibly cultural or emotional integration—leading to a partial identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的"" (my mother is from a village in Baiyun District with a clan hall) → indicates family historical rootedness (RL3).  
- ""爸爸是潮汕归侨"" (my father is a returnee overseas Chinese from Chaoshan) → introduces a mixed heritage, possibly affecting cultural belonging.  
- ""我广州土生土长"" (I was born and raised in Guangzhou) → directly indicates personal rootedness and upbringing in the city (RL3).  
- ""我觉得自己只是半个广州人"" (I feel like I'm only half a Guangzhou person) → suggests that the author uses internal criteria (possibly cultural, possibly social) to evaluate their own local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses family background and upbringing to assess their own local identity but ultimately feels incomplete in that identity. The presence of a clan hall and being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) are presented as strong local identity markers, but the mixed heritage (归侨) introduces a sense of distance or difference. This implies that the author believes **family rootedness and upbringing** are important standards for defining local identity, even if they personally feel only partially included.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **being born and raised in Guangzhou** and **family historical rootedness** as important criteria for local identity. The feeling of being only ""half a Guangzhou person"" does not negate these criteria but rather reflects a personal experience of not fully meeting them emotionally or culturally.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author emphasizes **being born and raised in Guangzhou** and **family historical ties** (including clan heritage) as the foundation for evaluating local identity.

？？？我广州话有乡音，我都系广州人，去祠堂都系讲乡音,(no RL label),"  
The author is expressing that despite having a rural accent in Cantonese, they still identify strongly as a Guangzhou person (""我都系广州人""), and even in formal family settings like ancestral halls,乡音 (rural accent) is used. This suggests that the author does **not** accept the idea that having a rural accent disqualifies someone from being considered a ""local"" (Guangzhou person). Instead, they are pushing back against such a view.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""广州话有乡音"" (has a rural accent in Cantonese): linguistic feature  
- ""我都系广州人"" (I'm still a Guangzhou person): identity claim  
- ""去祠堂都系讲乡音"" (even in ancestral halls, we speak with a rural accent): cultural-linguistic recognition and family rootedness

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **resisting** the idea that linguistic ""purity"" (i.e., lack of rural accent) is a criterion for being considered a Guangzhou person. They are asserting that having a rural accent — and by implication, a rural background — does not exclude someone from local identity. Therefore, the author is **not endorsing** linguistic-cultural recognition as a valid standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **rejects** the idea that accent (RL4) should be used to exclude someone from local identity. They are not using linguistic features as a boundary marker, but rather **arguing against** such a boundary.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **does not endorse** any RL criteria for defining ""local people"" in this passage — and is instead **resisting** a commonly held exclusionary standard — **no RL label applies**.

虽然我家也好几代在这边，也是讲粤语，但是只说我是广州本地人，但不算广州土著，因为我是番禺的,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a nuanced view of local identity in Guangzhou, where despite having a multigenerational family history in the area and speaking Cantonese, they are not considered a ""true local"" (土著) because they are from Panyu. This implies that there is a distinction being made between being a ""local person"" and a ""native"" or ""true local,"" with the latter requiring a more specific or deeper rootedness than just family history or language.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""好几代在这边"" (several generations here) points to family rootedness.  
- ""讲粤语"" (speak Cantonese) points to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""不算广州土著，因为我是番禺的"" (not considered a Guangzhou native because I’m from Panyu) implies a vernacular spatial boundary or hierarchy that distinguishes between different areas within Guangzhou in terms of ""true local"" status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author meets the criteria for both RL3 (family rootedness) and RL4 (linguistic-cultural recognition), they are still excluded from being considered a ""true local"" based on the area they come from. This indicates that the author accepts a spatial hierarchy or social perception that certain areas within Guangzhou are more ""local"" than others, despite meeting other criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that certain areas (presumably central or historically core areas of Guangzhou) are more authentically ""local"" than others like Panyu, which reflects a shared or habitual spatial perception of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author accepts a socially conventional or habitual understanding that Panyu, while part of Guangzhou, is not considered the core or ""true"" local area in terms of identity. This spatial distinction is used to define or evaluate the depth of local belonging.

The author is clarifying what constitutes a ""true local"" (土著) in Guangzhou, emphasizing that long-term rootedness and ancestral presence in the city are rare. They explain their own family history of migration and return, indicating that continuous local settlement is exceptional. The author implies that most ""true locals"" have long since left Guangzhou for overseas destinations, making remaining locals extremely rare.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门"" (Before the Republic era, Guangzhou was only from Ximenkou to Dadongmen) – refers to historical spatial boundaries, but used to frame the scope of original local identity.  
- ""我家没有祠堂"" (My family doesn't have a clan hall) – suggests lack of long-standing ancestral roots.  
- ""清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来"" (Family fled after doing business in Xiguan during the Qing dynasty and later returned) – indicates a disrupted family history, contrasting with rootedness.  
- ""广州土著大部分都走国外"" (Most Guangzhou natives have gone abroad) – highlights the rarity of continuous local rootedness.  
- ""留下来万中无一"" (Remaining locals are one in ten thousand) – emphasizes the high standard for being a true native/local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author defines ""true local"" based on generational continuity and ancestral rootedness in Guangzhou. They contrast their own family's disrupted history with the idea of a ""true native"" who has never left. The rarity of such continuity underscores the author's view that family historical rootedness is the key criterion for authentic local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **family rootedness** (generational continuity and ancestral presence) as the standard for defining ""true local identity"" in Guangzhou.

世代居住在广州虽然各种原因移居但坚持保留广州语言文化饮食习惯传统精神内核的社群是不是比现在只讲普通话唔食白切鸡唔听粤语歌的本地人更广州？当然土不土著没啥优越的传统跟不上时代被抛弃也是必然。,RL4,"  
The author is posing a rhetorical question that challenges a conventional understanding of ""local identity."" They imply that **people who have historically lived in Guangzhou, moved away for various reasons, but still retain Guangzhou's cultural elements (language, food, music, and values)** may be more ""Guangzhou"" than current residents who no longer practice those traditions. The author critiques the idea that being ""local"" (土著) inherently means being superior or more authentic if one does not maintain the cultural core.  

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""世代居住在广州""** (multi-generational residence in Guangzhou): points to family rootedness (RL3).  
- **""移居但坚持保留广州语言文化饮食习惯传统精神内核""** (moved away but retained language, food, customs, and values): points to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).  
- **""只讲普通话唔食白切鸡唔听粤语歌""** (only speak Mandarin, don't eat white-cut chicken, don't listen to Cantonese songs): also points to linguistic and cultural habits (RL4).  
- The contrast between **historical rootedness and current cultural practice** suggests that **culture and identity continuity** are more important than administrative or residential status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author argues that **true local identity is not about current residence or administrative status**, but about **cultural continuity** — especially language, food, and traditions. They also critique the notion that being a ""native"" (土著) is inherently superior if that person no longer embodies the cultural core. Thus, **linguistic and cultural identity are central to what the author considers authentic ""localness.""**

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses cultural and linguistic continuity** (RL4) as the **key standard** for defining ""local identity.""  
While **family rootedness (RL3)** is mentioned, it is framed as **insufficient on its own** — the author explicitly says that **even locals can lose their ""localness"" if they abandon cultural practices**, and **non-residents can retain it through culture**. Therefore, **RL3 is not the endorsed standard**, while **RL4 is strongly endorsed.**

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author defines ""local identity"" based on **retaining Cantonese language, food, and cultural habits**, regardless of current residence or generational status.

Output: RL4"
不算吧，我外公开始来广州工作我妈他们在广州长大的，在家也都是说粤语，基本只有清明才会回老家一两天，他们都不会说自己是广州人。,"RL3, RL4","  
The author is expressing a sense of identity dissonance — despite their family having lived in Guangzhou for multiple generations (starting with the maternal grandfather), speaking Cantonese at home, and having minimal ties to their ancestral hometown (only returning for Qingming Festival), the author's mother and others in their family still do not identify as ""Guangzhou people."" This reflects an internalized standard of what qualifies someone as ""local,"" which the author's family does not feel they meet.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""My maternal grandfather started working in Guangzhou"" and ""my mother grew up in Guangzhou"" point to **family rootedness** and generational presence in the city.  
- ""Speaking Cantonese at home"" suggests **linguistic-cultural recognition**.  
- ""Only return to hometown for Qingming for one or two days"" indicates minimal connection to ancestral roots outside Guangzhou.  
- Despite all this, the author states they ""would not call themselves Guangzhou people,"" revealing a **self-exclusion** based on some internalized standard of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Although the family has lived in Guangzhou for generations and speaks Cantonese, the author implies that **something more is required** to be considered a ""true"" local. This suggests that **family historical rootedness (RL3)** and **linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** are not sufficient in the author's own perception, and that there may be an **implicit standard of generational depth or cultural legitimacy** that they feel they do not meet.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **family rootedness** and **linguistic-cultural recognition** as relevant to local identity, but also implies that these are not enough — suggesting that these criteria are **part of the broader framework** for defining ""local people."" The author does not explicitly endorse any one RL category as the sole standard, but the **presence and insufficiency** of RL3 and RL4 elements still reflects their relevance in the author's understanding of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text reflects both **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** — through multi-generational presence in Guangzhou — and **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** — through Cantonese being spoken at home — as **relevant but insufficient** criteria in the author's perception of ""local"" identity.

广州本地人一般指老四区世居吧（老越秀、老荔湾、老东山、海珠）吧。因为好像我们这种，至少五代都在广州土生土长，有分红有地，最多都系叫广州客家人。,"RL1, RL3, RL6","  
The author is defining who counts as ""Guangzhou locals"" by referring to people who have lived in the traditional core districts (老四区: old Yuexiu, old Liwan, old Dongshan, Haizhu) for multiple generations. They emphasize generational depth (""at least five generations""), rootedness (""土生土长""), and material indicators of local embeddedness such as ""dividends"" and ""land."" The author also contrasts this with being labeled as ""Guangzhou Hakka,"" suggesting that mere long-term residence is not sufficient without deeper local integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""五代都在广州土生土长"" (five generations have been born and raised in Guangzhou) – indicates generational rootedness.  
- ""有分红有地"" (have dividends and land) – indicates social embeddedness and access to local collective resources.  
- Reference to specific traditional urban districts (老四区) – implies habitual spatial cognition and historical belonging.  
- ""最多都系叫广州客家人"" (at most, we are called Guangzhou Hakkas) – suggests that even with deep roots, identity may still be contested, highlighting the strict standards for being recognized as a ""true local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is clearly setting high standards for being considered a ""true local"" — not just long-term residence or even multi-generational presence, but also social and economic integration into the local community (e.g., access to dividends and land), as well as belonging to the historically rooted districts. These criteria function to **exclude** certain groups (e.g., Guangzhou Hakkas) from the core ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses **family rootedness** (五代土生土长), **social embeddedness** (有分红有地), and **habitual spatial cognition** (老四区) as standards for defining who is a ""true Guangzhou local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is clearly endorsed through the emphasis on being ""土生土长"" and ""五代都在广州"" — indicating generational depth of family settlement.  
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is also endorsed through the mention of ""有分红有地,"" which reflects access to local collective resources and social integration.  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** is also relevant, as the author refers to the ""old four districts"" as the symbolic and historically accepted core of Guangzhou local identity.

Output: RL1, RL3, RL6"
讲白话？,RL4,"  
The author uses the phrase ""讲白话？"" (Speak Cantonese?), which implies that speaking the local dialect—Cantonese—is an important marker for identifying who is a ""local"" person. This is not just a neutral observation but carries an implicit evaluative function, potentially distinguishing locals from outsiders.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""讲白话？"" (Speak Cantonese?) directly references the use of a regional dialect.
- The rhetorical nature of the question suggests that the ability to speak the local language is expected or required for being considered a local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is using linguistic ability—specifically, speaking Cantonese—as a boundary marker to assess or question someone's local identity. This aligns with the use of language as a symbolic and practical criterion for inclusion or exclusion from the ""local"" group.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the use of dialect or language as a standard for defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, as the author uses language (Cantonese) as a criterion for identifying or questioning someone's local identity.

Output: RL4"
有分红就算,RL6,"  
The author is expressing that having access to community dividends (分红) is a key criterion for being considered a ""local"" person. This implies that participation in local economic benefits or collective resources is being used as a standard to define local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有分红"" (having dividends) refers to access to local collective economic benefits, often tied to rural collectives or urban village communities.  
- This implies a form of local embeddedness or entitlement based on social or economic integration into the local system.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses ""having dividends"" as a clear boundary for defining who is considered a ""local"" person. This reflects a standard of social embeddedness — access to local resources and benefits is treated as proof of belonging or legitimacy in the local context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that having dividends is sufficient to count someone as ""local,"" indicating that this is a core standard they personally use or accept for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as the author uses access to local economic or social resources (dividends) as the standard for defining who is considered a ""local"" person.

Output: RL6"
不会说不算,RL4,"  
The phrase ""不会说不算"" (if you can't speak it, you don't count) is a concise expression that uses linguistic ability—specifically, the ability to speak the local language or dialect—as a criterion for determining who qualifies as a ""local."" The author implies that language proficiency is a key boundary marker for inclusion in the ""local"" identity group.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不会说"" (can't speak) refers to linguistic ability or lack thereof.  
- ""不算"" (doesn't count) indicates exclusion from the ""local"" identity based on that linguistic criterion.  
- The overall logic frames language use as a gatekeeping mechanism for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses linguistic competence as a clear and explicit standard to define who is considered a ""local person."" This reflects a boundary-drawing mechanism where speaking the local language is a prerequisite for being recognized as part of the local community.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that linguistic ability—specifically speaking the local language—is a standard for defining ""local identity."" There is no indication of resistance or critique toward this standard.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, as it uses language ability (specifically speaking the local language) as a key criterion for determining local identity.

Output: RL4"
看年龄，时代不一样，现在00后很多土生土长的广州人也不会粤语,RL3,"  
The author is pointing out that being a ""true local"" (in this case, a native Guangzhou person) does not necessarily equate with speaking the local dialect (Cantonese). They note that many post-2000s (00后) who are ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) still do not speak Cantonese, implying that family rootedness or generational presence in the area is still a key part of local identity, even if linguistic-cultural recognition is not present.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的广州人"" (native Guangzhou people) — directly points to family rootedness and local upbringing.  
- ""不会粤语"" (cannot speak Cantonese) — although related to RL4 (linguistic-cultural recognition), the author is downplaying its importance in defining local identity.  
- ""看年龄，时代不一样"" (it depends on age, the times are different) — indicates generational change but not a direct RL element unless tied to identity criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author emphasizes that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised in Guangzhou) is still a significant marker of being considered a ""local,"" even if the person doesn't speak Cantonese. This reaffirms family rootedness and upbringing in the area as a foundational standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being born and raised locally (family rootedness) is the key criterion for being considered a local, even when linguistic-cultural recognition is absent.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as the author implicitly upholds the idea that being ""born and raised here"" is the core standard for defining ""local identity,"" even in the absence of language proficiency.

Output: RL3"
从小是从什么时候开始？如果80年代生，不会说广州话不太可能。如果00年生，也很正常,RL3,"  
The author is discussing the generational shift in language acquisition, particularly regarding the ability to speak Cantonese (Guangzhou dialect). They imply that being able to speak the local language is historically and generationally conditioned — for someone born in the 1980s, not speaking Cantonese is unusual, whereas for someone born around 2000, it's perfectly normal. This suggests that language ability is closely tied to the timing of one's upbringing in the local context.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从小"" (since childhood): Indicates the importance of early life experiences in shaping identity.  
- ""80年代生"" (born in the 1980s) and ""00年生"" (born around 2000): Generational markers used to evaluate linguistic and potentially local identity.  
- ""不会说广州话不太可能"" (unlikely not to speak Cantonese) and ""也很正常"" (very normal): Reflect expectations about linguistic-cultural belonging based on when one grew up locally.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a point about how the timing of one's upbringing in the city shapes their linguistic and thus cultural integration. For the author, growing up in the local area from a young age — and thereby acquiring the local language — is a key marker of local identity. The contrast between generations implies that the local identity standard has shifted over time, but the core idea remains: being ""local"" is tied to having a long-standing, formative presence in the area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""local"" depends on having grown up in the area from childhood (especially for those born before the 2000s), and that this upbringing is reflected in language ability.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author uses generational timing and childhood upbringing in the local area as key indicators of local identity. Although language is mentioned (which relates to RL4), the core argument hinges on when someone grew up locally — not just on language use alone.

真唏嘘，当年我小学中学的班里分别有两个外省转学来的同学，刚来的时候很自然的他们一句粤语都不会，可是小学那个女生后来我中学去外面补习班偶尔遇上了，一口广州话真的完全听不出来她原来三四年级转学来的时候一颗粤语都不会说。另一位初中同班也同理，初二来的时候一丁丁点都不会，可是高三时候他广州话已经是没口音的流利了，看着现在这几个generation我真的挺不解的 另外，我在悉尼这边也认识超级多悉尼土生土长的abc说一口流利广州话你根本就不知道他/她是在澳洲出生长大的，反而广州本地的却变成这样,RL4,"  
The author expresses surprise and confusion at how non-local students who moved to Guangzhou were able to acquire fluent Cantonese without an accent over time, to the point of being indistinguishable from locals. They contrast this with the current generation of local Guangzhou youth who may not speak Cantonese as fluently. The author also notes that even Australian-born ABCs (Australian-born Chinese) can speak fluent Cantonese and sound like locals, further emphasizing the importance of language proficiency as a marker of local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author repeatedly discusses the **acquisition of Cantonese** and the **loss of accent** as indicators of blending into the local community.
- The author contrasts this with current local youth who may not speak fluent Cantonese, implying a shift or inconsistency in cultural-linguistic identity.
- The author emphasizes **linguistic integration** as a key part of being perceived as local, regardless of actual birthplace or migration background.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's main point is that **mastery of the local language (Cantonese) without an accent** is a powerful marker of local identity, even surpassing birthplace or generational status. The author seems to believe that **speaking like a local is equivalent to being a local**, or at least being accepted as one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **linguistic-cultural recognition**, particularly **fluency in Cantonese and lack of accent**, as a standard for being accepted or perceived as a ""local"" person, regardless of actual origin or family history.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses language proficiency and accent as the primary markers for determining local identity.

广州出世叫本地人..但系广州某村出世加有分红或有地叫土著.这样比较容易解释,RL6,"  
The author is making a distinction between being born in Guangzhou (""本地人"" – local person) and being a true ""土著"" (indigenous/native/local in a deeper sense). The key point is that being a ""土著"" requires not only birth in the area but also deeper social and economic integration, such as having **dividends** or **land rights**, which reflect **embedded local social and economic status**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""广州出世"" (born in Guangzhou) — potentially related to family rootedness or administrative legitimacy.  
- ""某村出世"" (born in a certain village) — could imply localized family history or rootedness.  
- ""有分红"" (having dividends) — directly points to **local social embeddedness**, especially in rural or semi-rural collective economic systems.  
- ""有地"" (having land) — also points to **local asset ownership**, which is closely tied to long-term local belonging and status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **not merely describing birthplace** or administrative belonging. Instead, they are emphasizing that **true local status (""土著"") depends on deeper social and economic integration**, particularly **possession of local collective resources** like land and dividends. This reflects a **standard of social embeddedness** used to define who is truly local in a deeper, more legitimate sense.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **dividends and land rights** as **key criteria** for defining a more authentic or rooted form of local identity (""土著""), distinguishing it from the broader category of ""本地人"" (local person). This is not a neutral description but a **value-laden distinction** used to define **local legitimacy**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author uses **possession of local economic assets and social dividends** to define a deeper, more legitimate form of local identity.

Output: RL6"
那你有没分红或者土地阿？,RL6,"  
The question ""Have you ever received dividends or owned land?"" suggests an inquiry into whether someone has tangible, embedded local assets—such as land use rights or community-based economic benefits—that signify deeper social integration or rootedness in the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""分红 (dividends)"" implies participation in local collective economic benefits, often tied to rural or village-level communities.
- ""土地 (land)"" refers to land ownership or rights, which is often a marker of local belonging in rural or semi-urbanized areas, especially in contexts involving land collectives or village communities.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The question functions as a way to assess whether the person being asked has material or institutional ties to the local area that go beyond mere residence—such as rights to land or financial benefits from local collective assets. These are indicators of deep-rooted social embeddedness and local status.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the statement is phrased as a question, it implies that the speaker sees dividends and land rights as relevant and perhaps expected indicators of local belonging or local identity. There is no indication of resistance or criticism toward this standard, suggesting implicit endorsement.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as it refers to embedded local assets—dividends and land—as criteria or indicators of local identity or belonging.

Output: RL6"
有分红，屋企有栋有红本子的楼,RL6,"  
The author emphasizes having **dividends** (""有分红"") and owning a **registered property (""红本子的楼"")**, which indicates a form of **local asset ownership** and **community integration**. This implies that such economic and social resources are seen as markers of being deeply rooted in the local area and potentially used to distinguish ""true locals"" from others.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""有分红"" (having dividends): Suggests participation in local collective benefits or village/community-level economic distribution.
- ""屋企有栋有红本子的楼"" (owning a house with a red property ownership certificate): Indicates formal property ownership, which often symbolizes long-term local integration and legal recognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
These elements are not just about wealth or property ownership in general; they are used to **signal deep local roots, legitimacy, and belonging**. The author implicitly suggests that possessing these resources is a standard for being recognized as a ""true"" or ""established"" local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and implies that **ownership of local assets (property, dividends)** contributes to or defines local identity, especially in contrast to more transient or less integrated residents.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, which includes **possession of embedded local assets** (like property with formal documentation) and **participation in local economic benefits (dividends)** as indicators of deep social rootedness and local legitimacy.

有祠堂有分红,RL6,"  
The phrase ""有祠堂有分红"" (has a clan hall and receives dividends) implies a deep familial and community connection to the local area. It suggests that the person or group being described has ancestral roots and tangible social or economic benefits tied to the local community, which the author associates with being ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祠堂"" (clan hall) indicates long-standing family or lineage presence in the area — a marker of historical rootedness.  
- ""分红"" (dividends) refers to economic benefits derived from local collective assets or community membership — a form of embedded local social or economic status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Together, these elements point to the author viewing deep social integration — both through family history and participation in local economic benefits — as key to defining ""local"" identity. These are not just descriptions of lifestyle or economic condition; they are being used as **standards for determining who is truly local**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses these factors (ancestral presence and local economic integration) as **legitimate or defining features of local identity**, not just as background facts or observations of others' conditions.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text best matches **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, because it emphasizes the possession of embedded local assets (dividends) and symbolic markers of deep-rooted local belonging (clan hall) as a way to distinguish ""true locals.""

The author clearly distinguishes between different levels of ""localness"" in Guangzhou. They argue that only those whose **ancestors have been in Guangzhou for generations** and who **have ancestral halls** can be considered **true locals**, while others, even if they are registered as Guangzhou residents (""new入户"" – new household registrants), are merely ""new Guangzhou people."" The author also identifies themselves as a local from Zengcheng, indicating a nuanced view of local identity based on generational rootedness and geography.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""祖辈都是在广州这边的"" (ancestors have been in Guangzhou) → family historical rootedness.  
- ""有祠堂"" (have ancestral halls) → symbolic of generational settlement and lineage.  
- ""新广州人"" (new Guangzhou person) → implies a hierarchy of local identity.  
- ""我是广州本地"" (I am a local in Guangzhou) → self-identification as a ""true local.""  
- ""增城这边的"" (from Zengcheng) → geographical identity, possibly linked to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), but not used by the author as the **main criterion** for defining ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **family lineage** and **ancestral presence (e.g., ancestral halls)** as the **main criteria** to distinguish between ""true locals"" and ""new locals."" The mention of Zengcheng is more about self-identification than a boundary-drawing mechanism for local identity. Therefore, **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** is the dominant logic.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** generational family settlement and ancestral continuity as the **primary standard** for defining who is a ""true"" Guangzhou local.

增城是后来并入广州的，甚至连大家口中广义上的广州人都不算贴主要是会说粤语我觉得他可能更适合说自己是广州本地人,RL4,"  
The author is discussing the status of **增城 (Zengcheng)** — an area that was later incorporated into Guangzhou — and questioning whether its residents can be considered “**广义上的广州人**” (broadly defined Guangzhou people). The key point made is that **speaking Cantonese** is central to being seen (and seeing oneself) as a “local” Guangzhou person, implying that administrative integration alone is not sufficient for local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “**增城是后来并入广州的**” (Zengcheng was later incorporated into Guangzhou): This points to **administrative legitimacy (RL2)**, but the author does **not** endorse administrative status as sufficient for being considered “local.”
- “**会说粤语**” (can speak Cantonese): This is clearly emphasized as the **key criterion** for being perceived or self-identifying as a “local” Guangzhou person.
- “**更适合说自己是广州本地人**” (more suitable to call oneself a local Guangzhou person): This suggests that **linguistic-cultural recognition** is the author’s **endorsed standard** for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author **rejects** the idea that administrative integration (RL2) alone defines local identity. Instead, they **emphasize** the importance of **speaking Cantonese** as the **main criterion** for being considered a “local” Guangzhou person. This shows a **clear endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4)** over administrative boundaries.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition** is clearly **endorsed** by the author as the **basis for defining local identity** in this text.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author’s belief that **speaking Cantonese** is the **core standard** for determining whether someone can be considered a “local” Guangzhou person, even if they live in a part of Guangzhou administratively. This aligns directly with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**.

是本地人，不是土著，还有些人在那里卜佬卜佬，分红的时候可没见你卜佬,RL6,"  
The author is making a distinction between being a ""本地人"" (local person) and a ""土著"" (indigenous/native person), suggesting that simply acting like a local or claiming local identity doesn't grant access to certain local privileges (e.g., dividends). The author implies that true local identity is tied to deeper, more embedded forms of belonging—such as rights to community resources like dividends—rather than superficial behaviors.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不是土著"" (not indigenous/native) implies a hierarchy or distinction in the depth of local belonging.  
- ""分红"" (dividends) refers to material or community-based benefits tied to local status, indicating embedded social or economic rights.  
- The contrast between ""卜佬卜佬"" (acting or pretending to be local) and actual access to local benefits suggests that the author sees a difference between appearance and real local status.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author critiques those who claim or act local (""卜佬卜佬"") without having the deeper social or economic ties that confer real local status (e.g., access to dividends). This implies that the author endorses **social embeddedness**—specifically, access to local resources like dividends—as the real marker of local identity, not just behavior or self-identification.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses **embedded local assets and community rights** (like dividends) as the standard for defining true local identity. This is not just about behavior or performance, but about real, institutionalized social and economic ties.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, as the author is emphasizing the importance of integration into local social networks and access to local material or symbolic resources (like dividends) as the basis for defining who is truly a ""local person.""

补充一下 是光谷东感觉光谷广场那一块交通也是乱糟的,RL5,"  
The author is expressing a negative evaluation of the traffic conditions around **Guanggu Square**, indicating that the area feels chaotic or disordered in terms of transportation. The phrase ""光谷东感觉光谷广场那一块交通也是乱糟的"" translates to something like ""in the Guanggu East area, the traffic around Guanggu Square feels chaotic too."" This is a **comment on the functional livability** of the area, particularly regarding transportation infrastructure.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""交通也是乱糟的"" (the traffic is also chaotic): refers to **transportation conditions**, which fall under **functional livability**.
- The comment is about **environmental quality** and **urban functionality**, not about identity, belonging, or administrative/cultural markers.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating the **quality of the urban environment**, particularly traffic conditions, which is part of how one might assess the **livability** of a local area. Although not a direct statement like ""only people who live in well-organized areas are locals,"" the author implies that **traffic chaos detracts from the area’s desirability or quality as a local space**.

This is **not** a statement about administrative belonging, family rootedness, language, or occupation. It is a **comment on the physical and functional quality of the area**, which is relevant to **RL5: Functional Livability**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author evaluates the **urban environment** (specifically traffic conditions) as a **marker of the area’s quality**, which is part of how one might define or perceive a ""desirable"" or ""true"" local area. This aligns with **RL5**, which includes evaluations of **infrastructure, convenience, and environmental quality** used to judge the **desirability or authenticity of a local area**.

因为武汉平时只说汉口、武昌、汉阳三镇，区的话很多，比如汉口包含江汉、江岸、硚口、东西湖、等等等等区，在长江以北、汉水以北的地界都属于汉口。武汉是被长江和汉江分割成了3个部分，你说的那些区是行政区划，3镇才是地理说法，你口中的老武汉人没有说错,RL1,"  
The author is clarifying how locals in Wuhan conceptualize the city—not by formal administrative districts, but by the historically and culturally significant ""Three Towns"" (汉口, 武昌, 汉阳). They emphasize that this is the way ""老武汉人"" (longtime Wuhan locals) understand and talk about the city. The author affirms that this habitual spatial understanding is valid and reflects local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Emphasis on ""三镇"" (Three Towns: Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang) as the preferred local spatial framework.  
- Distinction between ""地理说法"" (geographical understanding) and ""行政区划"" (administrative divisions).  
- Reference to natural geographic boundaries (长江, 汉江 — Yangtze River, Han River) that define the local spatial imagination.  
- Mention of ""老武汉人"" (longtime locals) as those who uphold this traditional spatial cognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author defends the traditional, socially shared spatial understanding of Wuhan based on the Three Towns, contrasting it with formal administrative divisions. This habitual, historical, and culturally rooted way of dividing the city is used to affirm a local identity grounded in shared perception and tradition.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the use of shared, habitual, and historically sedimented spatial cognition—specifically the Three Towns—as a legitimate and meaningful way to define and express local identity in Wuhan.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author affirms a socially shared, historically rooted way of understanding the city's spatial structure that goes beyond administrative boundaries and is tied to local identity.

住光谷的不敢讲话鄙视链底层,RL1,"  
The author uses a concise and emotionally charged expression to describe a social hierarchy or ""鄙视链 (hierarchy of contempt)"" in which people who live in the Guanggu area are positioned at the bottom and therefore ""不敢讲话 (dare not speak up)."" This implies that where one lives is associated with a certain status in the local identity hierarchy.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""住光谷的 (those who live in Guanggu)"" refers to a specific residential area.
- ""鄙视链底层 (bottom of the hierarchy of contempt)"" suggests a symbolic ranking of local areas or residents.
- The statement implies that place of residence is being used as a standard for evaluating or ranking local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing the Guanggu area or its residents; they are highlighting how living in a particular area can affect one's perceived status or confidence within the local social structure. This suggests that **residential location is being used as a symbolic marker of local identity or belonging**, even if indirectly or socially constructed.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly accepts and conveys the idea that residential location (in this case, Guanggu) plays a role in how ""local"" someone is perceived to be, or how much symbolic value their local identity carries. This is not a mere description of physical space or personal preference, but a reflection of how space is socially ranked.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author is referencing a socially constructed hierarchy based on where people live—specifically, Guanggu being at the bottom of the local identity hierarchy. This reflects a shared or habitual perception of intra-urban spatial categories that carry symbolic or evaluative meaning regarding ""localness.""

Output: RL1"
我经常因为我的青普被当成外码,RL4,"  
The author expresses that due to their use of ""Qingpu dialect"" (青普), they are often mistaken for an outsider (外码). This indicates that linguistic features—specifically, the way one speaks—are being used by others (and possibly the author implicitly accepts this) as a boundary marker to judge whether someone is a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""青普"" (Qingpu dialect) clearly refers to a local dialect or accent.
- ""被当成外码"" (mistaken for an outsider) indicates that linguistic recognition is used as a standard for identifying locals vs. non-locals.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that speaking a non-dominant local dialect or having a non-standard accent leads others to exclude them from the ""local"" category. This shows that linguistic-cultural recognition—in the form of dialect or accent—is used as a standard for defining who is considered local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author may feel unfairly judged, they do not reject the logic of using dialect or accent as a marker of local identity. The statement reflects an implicit acceptance that linguistic-cultural recognition plays a role in how ""local identity"" is assessed.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as it revolves around the idea that speaking a certain dialect or having a certain accent affects whether someone is perceived as a local.

The author is describing a prevalent mindset among Wuhan residents, especially those living in the core of Hankou, who view areas beyond the inner ring as ""villages"" or rural. They emphasize that even if property prices were equal, people who grew up in traditional core areas (e.g., Liuduqiao, Youyilu, Qushuilou, Jianghanlu) still strongly identify those areas as the ""true"" center of Hankou, while places like Huangpulu are seen as suburban. This reflects a habitual, symbolic understanding of spatial hierarchy and local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific areas: 汉口核心 (core of Hankou), 内环 (inner ring), 六渡桥, 友谊路, 取水楼, 江汉路, 黄浦路, 民众乐园.  
- Evaluative terms: 皆为村 (all are villages), 市郊 (suburbs), 市中心 (city center), 城区 (urban area), 核心 (core).  
- Implied identity boundary: A clear distinction is made between ""core"" and ""non-core"" areas, based not on administrative boundaries or economic factors, but on shared historical and emotional perceptions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not describing administrative facts, economic disparities, or personal preferences. Rather, they are conveying a **socially shared perception**—a **habitual, symbolic spatial mapping**—that defines who belongs to the ""real"" local area and who does not. This perception is rooted in long-standing emotional and historical associations with specific neighborhoods.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and illustrates the idea that **local identity is shaped by habitual, shared spatial perceptions**—that is, the idea that some areas are ""central"" and others are ""peripheral"" not by official definition, but by **cultural and emotional consensus**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns directly with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is describing how people define local identity and spatial belonging based on **shared emotional and symbolic maps** of the city, not official boundaries or economic factors.

老武汉的土著莫名优越感，小时候总被瞧不起，搞得自己也觉得乡里人低人一等样的，只要去市内说蔡甸话，就是一种高高在上的眼神和爱买不买别把东西碰脏了的鄙视感。长大后发现，越是穷的老土著越是优越感强。现在武汉市内对我也没多大吸引力了，然后每次去玩也是蔡甸话说到嗨，不在乎别人的眼神。大女儿不会说蔡甸话真是……我没教育好啊然后不在乎别人的看法后，发现在武汉市内的年轻人都挺友好的，也很客气。可能都在成长吧,RL4,"  
The author reflects on their personal experience of being judged as a ""local"" based on dialect (蔡甸话), facing condescension from so-called ""老武汉的土著"" (native Wuhan people). They later embrace their蔡甸 identity and feel more at ease using their local dialect. The text conveys how language and cultural behavior were used by others to judge ""localness"" and superiority, and how the author eventually resists that standard.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **蔡甸话** (Caidian dialect): Explicitly mentioned as a cultural-linguistic marker that others use to judge ""localness"" and social status.  
- **老武汉的土著** (native Wuhan people): Implies a category of people seen as ""true locals"" due to rootedness or heritage.  
- **优越感** (superiority complex): Linked to language use and local identity perception.  
- **鄙视感** (disparagement): Based on dialect, suggesting linguistic-cultural boundaries of ""local"" identity.  
- **大女儿不会说蔡甸话** (eldest daughter doesn't speak Caidian dialect): Implies a concern with cultural transmission and identity continuity.  
- **不在乎别人的眼神** (not caring about others' looks): Indicates resistance to the linguistic-cultural standard but also personal identity negotiation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author describes how **language (蔡甸话)** was used by others as a boundary marker to distinguish ""real locals"" from ""lesser locals"" or ""outsiders"", and how this led to internalized inferiority. Later, the author reclaims their蔡甸 identity through language, indicating that **linguistic-cultural recognition** plays a central role in both the exclusion and reassertion of their local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **resists** the idea that speaking a certain dialect or being a ""native Wuhan person"" makes someone more ""local"" in a superior way.  
- However, they **embrace** the use of 蔡甸话 as a **positive marker of personal/local identity**, indicating that **language remains a meaningful criterion in their own identity construction**, even if they reject the hierarchy imposed by others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)** because the author ultimately affirms the importance of speaking the local dialect (蔡甸话) as part of their local identity, even while resisting the social hierarchy associated with it.

评论区的别这样对待黄陂啊，黄陂虽说远，但他现在也好歹是属于武汉的，也就相当于都是一个妈生的，各有各的优势，别瞧不起啊，毕竟地铁七号线以后也是要延长到黄陂的嘛，这样也方便多了，不过我在外面说我是黄陂人，也没见有人瞧不起或者诧异什么的啊,"RL2, RL5","  
The author is defending黄陂 (Huangpi) as part of Wuhan and arguing against discrimination or prejudice toward it. They emphasize that Huangpi now officially belongs to Wuhan (""belongs to Wuhan,"" ""equivalent to being born from the same mother""), and that it has its own advantages. They also mention future infrastructure improvements (extension of Metro Line 7) to further justify Huangpi's legitimacy as part of Wuhan. The author concludes by stating that when they identify themselves as a Huangpi person, they don't encounter discrimination or surprise, implying that administrative belonging and infrastructure development support a legitimate local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""Huangpi虽说远，但他现在也好歹是属于武汉的"" (Huangpi, though far, is now officially part of Wuhan) → administrative legitimacy.
- ""一个妈生的"" (born from the same mother) → metaphorical expression of shared local identity.
- ""地铁七号线以后也是要延长到黄陂的"" (Metro Line 7 will be extended to Huangpi) → functional livability and future convenience.
- ""在外面说我是黄陂人，也没见有人瞧不起或者诧异"" (saying I'm from Huangpi doesn’t provoke discrimination or surprise) → social acceptance and possibly linguistic-cultural recognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author uses **administrative belonging** (RL2) as the main argument to assert Huangpi’s legitimacy as part of Wuhan and thus the local identity of its residents. The mention of infrastructure (RL5) and social acceptance (possibly RL4 or RL6) are supportive points that reinforce the claim that Huangpi should not be discriminated against and should be considered a legitimate local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is explicitly endorsed by the author to define local identity: ""belongs to Wuhan,"" ""equivalent to being born from the same mother.""
- **RL5 (Functional Livability)** is mentioned (metro extension), but it is used to support the argument rather than being the primary standard for defining local identity. Still, the author implies that improved livability enhances Huangpi’s standing as a legitimate local area.
- **RL4 or RL6** are only indirectly implied (through social perception and acceptance), and not explicitly used as criteria by the author to define ""local identity"" in the way required by the annotation principles.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
- **RL2** is clearly the main category: the author uses administrative belonging as the core logic to define who is a ""local"" in Wuhan.
- **RL5** is also present and functions as a supportive standard that improves Huangpi’s status and integration into the city, reinforcing the author’s view that Huangpi should be seen as part of Wuhan and its residents as locals.

我新洲的，基本不认为自己是武汉人，感觉武汉人也不太看得起我们，我平时都是说行政区划上算武汉人,RL2,"  
The author clearly expresses a lack of identification with the ""Wuhan person"" label, indicating that both they and others (武汉人) do not truly see them as part of that group. They only accept the label in an **administrative sense**—that is, because their area (Xinzhou) is part of Wuhan's jurisdiction.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我新洲的"" (I'm from Xinzhou) – geographical identity.  
- ""基本不认为自己是武汉人"" (don't really consider myself a Wuhan person) – identity rejection.  
- ""武汉人也不太看得起我们"" (Wuhan people don't really respect us) – social hierarchy or boundary.  
- ""行政区划上算武汉人"" (classified as Wuhan people administratively) – administrative legitimacy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author distinguishes between **administrative classification** and **felt identity**, explicitly stating that they only accept the ""Wuhan person"" identity in the former sense. The author implies that **administrative boundaries alone do not confer a sense of belonging or recognition as a ""true local""**, but they still acknowledge it as a formal standard.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly acknowledges** administrative division as a **formal** standard for defining ""local identity"", even though they **reject it emotionally or socially**. Since the task is to identify criteria **endorsed or conveyed by the author** for defining ""local identity"", and the author **does state** that they are ""算武汉人"" (classified as Wuhan people) **administratively**, this counts as an endorsed **administrative legitimacy** criterion.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author acknowledges administrative division as a formal basis for defining local identity, even if they do not emotionally identify with it.

嗯嗯，谢谢你让我对现在的堤角有了更深的了解……让我想起了老武汉对于汉口区域的定义有句顺口溜“上有古田，下有肉联”（肉联就是现在的堤角）……可能我去堤角总是泛泛而去吧而自己住在古田，当然觉得这里交通便利，繁华方便哟，毕竟这几年宜家和山姆的打造让古田人气更足啦些，希望这两地齐头并进越来越好,RL1,"  
The author expresses a personal emotional connection to古田 (Gutian) and acknowledges a traditional local saying that defines the spatial boundary of Hankou as “上有古田，下有肉联” (“Gutian above, Roulian below”). This reflects a habitual, culturally embedded understanding of intra-city spatial identity. The author also contrasts their familiarity and comfort in Gutian with more superficial visits to 堤角 (Tijiao), implying a sense of rootedness and evaluative difference between the two areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “老武汉对于汉口区域的定义有句顺口溜 ‘上有古田，下有肉联’” — This is a culturally shared spatial认知, a symbolic boundary marker rooted in local tradition.  
- “自己住在古田，当然觉得这里交通便利，繁华方便” — Indicates a sense of personal rootedness and positive evaluation of Gutian, but not used as a standard for defining who is local.  
- “宜家和山姆的打造让古田人气更足” — Refers to improved functional livability, but used to explain Gutian’s rising popularity, not as a standard for defining ""local people.""  
- “我去堤角总是泛泛而去” — Implies a lack of deep connection to Tijiao, contrasting with the author’s rootedness in Gutian.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key functional role is played by the traditional saying, which reflects a **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented local perception** of spatial categories in Hankou. This saying serves as a **symbolic boundary** for defining what areas are considered part of the ""core"" Hankou identity. The author endorses this classification by referencing it positively and using it to frame their personal experience.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The **traditional saying** is explicitly referenced and used to structure the author’s reflection on local spatial identity — this is a clear endorsement of **Vernacular Spatial Authority** (RL1).  
- The discussion of Gutian’s improved amenities and the author’s personal residence there is more about personal preference or observation, not a standard for defining ""local people"" — **RL5 and RL6 are not endorsed as identity criteria**.  
- The author’s lack of connection to Tijiao is noted but not framed as a standard for judging others’ local identity — **not relevant for annotation**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects the author’s endorsement of a **shared, traditional, and symbolic spatial boundary** (“上有古田，下有肉联”) to define what areas are considered part of the local Hankou identity. This is a classic example of **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

Output: RL1"
武汉已经越来越大了，现在黄陂新洲都划进来了,RL2,"  
The author is pointing out that Wuhan has expanded in size, and areas like Huangpi and Xinzhou have now been incorporated into the city's administrative boundaries. This implies a change in the spatial definition of ""Wuhan"" due to administrative redistricting.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""武汉已经越来越大了"" (Wuhan has become bigger and bigger) suggests an evolving perception of the city's spatial extent.  
- ""黄陂新洲都划进来了"" (Huangpi and Xinzhou have been incorporated) clearly references administrative boundary changes and the inclusion of new areas under Wuhan's jurisdiction.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not expressing personal resistance to this change, nor are they evaluating the quality of life or cultural identity in these new areas. Instead, they are stating a fact: administrative inclusion is the basis for considering these areas part of Wuhan. This implies that the author sees administrative legitimacy as the criterion for defining the spatial scope of ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not resist or criticize the change; they present it as a natural development. The key point is the administrative boundary change—areas are now ""part of Wuhan"" because they were officially ""划进来"" (incorporated). This is a clear endorsement of administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining ""local"" identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the logic of **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the speaker defines or accepts that ""local identity"" is determined by official jurisdiction or administrative incorporation.

家里人是武钢的，记得小时候，一些武昌的亲戚一边羡慕我家人的“铁饭碗”一边嘲笑我是乡里伢。,RL7,"  
The author reflects on childhood experiences where their family worked at Wuhan Iron and Steel (武钢), a major state enterprise, and had a stable job (""铁饭碗""). Some relatives from Wuchang both envied this stability and mocked the author as a ""village kid"" (乡里伢). This indicates that **occupation** (working in a prestigious state enterprise) and **place of origin or upbringing** were used as symbolic boundaries to judge local identity and social status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""家里人是武钢的"" (family works at WuSteel) → links to occupational typification and social status.
- ""铁饭碗"" (iron rice bowl) → symbolizes job stability and social privilege.
- ""嘲笑我是乡里伢"" (mocked me as a village kid) → implies a perceived rural identity or background.
- The contrast between being envied and mocked shows that **occupation and place-based identity** are used as symbolic markers for social belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author presents a situation where **occupation (武钢 worker)** is linked to social privilege (""铁饭碗""), while **place-based identity (""乡里伢"")** is used to mock or exclude. This implies that **occupational identity is used as a symbolic boundary to define who is considered ""local"" or socially integrated**, even within the same city or region.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is recounting others' views (relatives), they do not explicitly reject the idea that **occupation and place of upbringing** are relevant to social and local identity. The mocking tone from others is presented as a social reality the author experienced, and the **text implicitly endorses the idea that occupational identity is used to define local belonging**, especially in contrast to rural identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL7: Occupational Typification**, where **occupational identity is used as a symbolic boundary to distinguish or define ""local"" identity**, even when that identity is contested or mocked.

老武汉人觉得很多地方都是乡里，多少年的印象，一下子改不了，我是青山区东北人后代，土生土长的，也被很多汉口人认为偏僻地方的人，我觉得周边的不算正宗武汉人，老观念没办法,"RL1, RL3","  
The author discusses how long-standing perceptions of spatial identity persist among ""老武汉人"" (old Wuhan locals), where certain areas are still seen as ""乡里"" (rural or peripheral) regardless of administrative or modern development changes. They also share a personal experience: as someone born and raised in Qingshan District (土生土长), a descendant of Northeastern migrants, they are still viewed by many Hankou residents as coming from a ""remote area."" The author also admits to holding a similar view—believing that people from surrounding areas are not ""正宗武汉人"" (authentic Wuhan locals)—and attributes this to ""老观念"" (old观念), implying that these views are deeply rooted in local identity logic.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""很多地方都是乡里"" (many places are still considered rural/peripheral) — points to a habitual spatial perception.  
- ""我是青山区东北人后代，土生土长的"" (I'm a native of Qingshan District, descendant of Northeastern migrants) — highlights rootedness and birthplace.  
- ""也被很多汉口人认为偏僻地方的人"" (seen by many Hankou people as coming from a remote area) — reflects spatial hierarchy and perception.  
- ""我觉得周边的不算正宗武汉人"" (I think people from surrounding areas are not authentic Wuhan locals) — reveals the author's own internalized standard for defining local identity.  
- ""老观念没办法"" (can't help old观念) — acknowledges the persistence of traditional or habitual logic in defining ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly endorses and reflects the idea that certain areas are not considered ""core"" or ""authentic"" parts of Wuhan based on long-standing social perceptions (RL1), and this perception affects who is seen as a ""true local."" At the same time, the author identifies as ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) (RL3), yet is still excluded by others based on spatial perception, showing that multiple RL criteria can be in play simultaneously. The author also does not reject this logic but frames it as a ""老观念,"" indicating a passive acceptance.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author implicitly accepts the habitual spatial logic that certain areas are not ""real"" Wuhan (RL1).  
- The author also identifies as ""土生土长"" — a marker of family rootedness and personal growth history — which they likely see as a valid basis for local identity (RL3).  
- These are criteria the author **does not resist** and **implicitly endorses** in defining ""who is a real local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** — the habitual perception of which areas ""count"" as local — and **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** — the emphasis on being born and raised in the area as a basis for local identity.

不是，武汉主城区是口音辨别的。只要不是地道汉口话才说是乡里的。黄陂的发音跟武汉人是不一样,RL4,"  
The author is clarifying that in Wuhan, the distinction between ""urban locals"" and ""non-locals"" (e.g., ""from the countryside"") is primarily based on dialect or accent. Specifically, if someone does not speak the authentic Hankou dialect, they are considered ""from the countryside."" The example of Huangpi pronunciation being different from that of Wuhan locals reinforces this point.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音辨别"" (distinguishing by accent) directly points to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- ""不是地道汉口话"" (not speaking authentic Hankou dialect) indicates linguistic deviation from the local norm.  
- ""乡里的"" (from the countryside) is used as a contrastive identity label based on accent.  
- Huangpi pronunciation being different is used to justify the claim.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly presents linguistic features—specifically accent—as the key standard used by Wuhan locals to distinguish between ""true locals"" and ""non-locals."" This is not a neutral observation of others’ speech patterns, but rather an explanation of how local identity is socially constructed and policed through linguistic criteria.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses and affirms the idea that accent is a legitimate or commonly accepted boundary marker of local identity, rather than rejecting it. The statement supports the use of linguistic-cultural features in defining who is considered a ""true"" local.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as it uses dialect and accent as the primary criteria for distinguishing locals from non-locals and reinforcing local identity boundaries.

 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。",none,"  
The author presents a detailed comparative analysis of various districts in Wuhan, focusing on economic data (GDP), population trends, housing prices, and development potential. The discussion revolves around which districts are economically strong or weak, which attract talent and investment, and which are declining. While the text is rich in socio-economic and spatial evaluation, it **does not explicitly or implicitly propose any criteria for defining who is or is not a ""local"" person**. The author does not make identity claims based on geography, language, family roots, or any other symbolic boundary. Instead, the focus is on **economic performance and housing market dynamics** as indicators of district quality or desirability.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific districts (e.g., Jianghan, Jiang’an, Donghu High-Tech Zone, Hanyang, Caidian) and their economic rankings.
- References to economic sectors (e.g., finance in Jianghan, high-tech industries in Donghu).
- Discussion of housing prices, population trends, and development potential.
- Cultural and lifestyle features (e.g., Jiangtan, old洋房, tourism in Hanyang).
- No explicit or implicit use of family rootedness, language, administrative boundaries, social embeddedness, or occupational typification to define ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's argument centers on **urban development, economic performance, and real estate trends**. While there is an evaluative tone about which areas are ""better"" or ""worse,"" these evaluations are **not linked to defining who qualifies as a ""local""** or what constitutes a ""true local area"" in terms of identity. The author does not propose or endorse any standard for judging local identity.

Despite the rich spatial and economic analysis, **no RL criteria are used by the author to define ""local identity.""** The author does not make claims such as:
- ""Only people from Jianghan are real Wuhan locals.""
- ""Those who speak Wuhan dialect are the true locals.""
- ""Only those who have lived here for generations count.""
- ""Only those with hukou in Wuhan are locals.""
- ""Only people working in high-tech industries are locals.""

The author also does not imply that **economic status, housing price, or industry type** are markers of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does **not define or evaluate ""local identity""** through any of the RL criteria, and the entire text focuses on **urban economic and real estate dynamics without linking them to identity standards**, **no RL category applies**.

@🔥 @cwntry 想到xyl说土生土长的水果湖人,RL3,"  
The author references someone (xyl) who identifies as ""土生土长的水果湖人"" — a person who was born and raised in Shahekou District (Shahekou, literally ""Sand Harbor,"" is a district in Dalian, and ""湖人"" here refers to people from Shahekou, similar to ""lake people""). This phrase emphasizes deep family rootedness and long-term growth in the area as the basis for claiming ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) is a key phrase indicating deep familial and personal historical connection to the area.  
- The mention of a specific local identity label (""水果湖人"") reflects both geographic and identity-based belonging.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author (or the person they quote) uses the idea of being born and raised in a specific local area as the standard for claiming authentic ""local"" identity. This reflects a belief that only those with long-term, generational ties to the area are ""true locals.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised"" in a place is the standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as it emphasizes being born and raised in a local area as the basis for local identity.

gdp 再高，跟汉南人有关系？,(no RL applies),"  
The author is questioning the relevance of high GDP to the identity or lived experience of ""Hannan people."" The tone suggests skepticism toward macro-level economic indicators being used to define or represent local identity. The author implies that GDP, while potentially impressive, does not necessarily reflect the local people's reality or sense of belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""GDP"" is mentioned as a macroeconomic indicator.
- The author contrasts GDP with the lived experience or identity of ""Hannan people.""
- There is an implicit critique of using economic metrics to represent or define local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not endorsing GDP as a standard for defining local identity; rather, they are questioning its relevance. The statement suggests that economic indicators like GDP do not align with or reflect the local people's sense of being ""local."" Therefore, this is not a criterion the author uses to define ""local people,"" but rather a rejected or resisted one.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** endorse GDP or macroeconomic indicators as relevant to defining ""local identity."" The statement critiques or distances GDP from local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not endorse GDP as a standard for defining ""local people,"" and the statement does not align with any of the RL1–RL7 criteria as something the author uses or implies as a standard for local identity, **no RL category applies**.

是老市民的心理落差……祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人， 混了几辈人还没到大城市上层，眼看这些祖辈都在乡下耕田的外地人来大武汉跟自己平起平坐，甚至混得比自己还好，失落……唯有排外能强挽一下老市民的尊严,RL3,"  
The author expresses a sense of psychological loss among ""老市民"" (long-established urban residents) in Wuhan. This loss stems from observing migrants—whose ancestors were originally rural farmers—now living alongside or even surpassing them in social status. The author attributes this sense of decline to generational differences in social mobility and implies that long-term local lineage and urban upbringing are markers of superior ""local"" status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人” (descendants who have lived in Wuhan for generations) emphasizes family rootedness and generational heritage.  
- “祖辈都在乡下耕田的外地人” (migrants whose ancestors were rural farmers) contrasts the author's own family history with that of newcomers, reinforcing the perceived difference in local legitimacy.  
- The emotional response of “心理落差” (psychological disparity) and “排外” (xenophobia) reflects the author's identification with a privileged local identity based on historical rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly constructs a hierarchy of local identity based on **generational rootedness** in the city. The contrast between long-established Wuhan families and recent rural migrants is central to the author’s sense of identity and grievance. The author implicitly endorses **family historical rootedness** as a legitimate basis for defining who is a “true local” and who is not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses **family historical rootedness** as a core criterion for defining local identity and uses it to distinguish between ""true locals"" and ""outsiders"" who have recently arrived and risen in status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author defines local identity based on multi-generational family settlement in Wuhan and contrasts it with the rural origins of newcomers.

经开合并进去了，我前几年就是住的经开，档案上填的就是这个，后来变成汉南了，搞得我很懵啊,RL2,"  
The author is expressing confusion and perhaps mild frustration over a change in administrative identity — specifically, that ""经开"" (Economic Development Zone) was merged into ""汉南"" (Hannan District). They mention that in the past, they identified with 经开 both in residence and in official records (""档案上填的""), but now the designation has changed, causing disorientation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""经开合并进去了"" (Jingkai was merged in) — indicates a change in administrative boundaries.
- ""档案上填的就是这个"" (I filled this in on my official records) — shows that administrative identity was once officially recognized and personally identified with.
- ""后来变成汉南了"" (Later it became Hannan) — reflects a change in administrative legitimacy.
- ""搞得我很懵啊"" (It confused me) — shows a personal sense of dislocation caused by the change in administrative identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s sense of local identity or belonging appears to have been shaped by the administrative designation at the time of their residence and official documentation. The merging of 经开 into 汉南 disrupts this identification, indicating that the author implicitly accepts administrative legitimacy as a criterion for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not resist or negate the relevance of administrative boundaries in defining local identity. Rather, their confusion stems from the change in those boundaries, implying that they do endorse administrative legitimacy as a standard for local identification.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author’s sense of local identity is tied to official administrative designations and changes in those designations cause confusion in personal identification.

我土生土长的武汉人，说实话20年前我觉得汉口是武汉最富裕的地方，现在光谷发展的太快了太好了，很多住市区的人跑这边来上班，武汉未来还是看光谷。,RL3,"  
The author identifies as a ""native Wuhan person"" (""我土生土长的武汉人""), which establishes their local identity. They then compare the traditional core area (""Hankou"") with the newly developed area (""Optics Valley / Guanggu""), noting that Guanggu has developed so rapidly and attractively that many city dwellers now commute there for work. The author concludes that Guanggu represents Wuhan's future.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""我土生土长的武汉人"" (native Wuhan person): clearly indicates family rootedness and generational belonging, pointing to RL3.  
- ""Hankou is the richest part of Wuhan"" / ""Guanggu has developed too fast and too well"": evaluative statements about areas, but not directly tied to defining ""local people.""  
- ""Many people from the city come here to work"": reflects functional mobility and livability, possibly pointing to RL5.  
- ""Wuhan’s future lies in Guanggu"": suggests a shift in the symbolic and possibly administrative or economic center, but this is more of a prediction than a definition of ""local.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's self-identification as a native Wuhan person is foundational to their voice and authority in commenting on Wuhan’s development. The rest of the statement evaluates areas and their development, but **does not explicitly or strongly imply** that the author uses current residence in Guanggu, or its livability, as a **criterion for defining who is a local**. The author remains a local by virtue of being born and raised there, not by where they live now or what area is booming.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Only the phrase ""我土生土长的武汉人"" directly reflects a **criterion the author uses or endorses** for defining ""local people"" — being born and raised in Wuhan.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This clearly aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, which emphasizes being ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) as the basis for being considered a ""true local.""

黄陂比新洲强多了，机场也在黄陂，人家物流商品市场，文旅游做得火爆。还有两条地铁线路。把阳逻剁有了，新洲只剩下在哪遥远偏僻的小山村啦,RL5,"  
The author is making a spatial comparison between two areas—Huangpi and Xinzhou—emphasizing that Huangpi is more developed due to the presence of major infrastructure (airport, logistics markets, cultural tourism, two metro lines), while Xinzhou is portrayed as remote and underdeveloped (""only has distant, remote villages""). This comparison is used to elevate Huangpi as a more legitimate or central ""local"" area, while marginalizing Xinzhou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Airport,"" ""logistics market,"" ""cultural tourism,"" ""two metro lines"" – these are all indicators of infrastructure and functional livability (RL5).  
- ""Xinzhou only has remote villages"" – again, contrasts with the idea of modern, convenient, and functionally developed space.  
- The spatial evaluation and boundary-drawing (""Huangpi is better than Xinzhou"") reflect a socially shared perception of which areas ""count"" as core local space.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely describing infrastructure; they are using it as a **basis for defining which area deserves recognition as the core ""local"" area**. Huangpi is portrayed as the superior area due to its infrastructure and convenience, while Xinzhou is excluded from this ""local"" core. This reflects a **symbolic ranking of space based on livability and functionality**, which becomes a standard for defining ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and uses **functional livability indicators** (transportation, economic infrastructure, development level) as a **standard to judge which area is more ""local"" or central**, thus meeting the criteria for RL5.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author uses the presence of infrastructure and development (metro, airport, logistics, tourism) as a **criterion to define or evaluate which area is more genuinely or desirably local**.

最早划分行政区的确是这样的。除了最早的中山路开元，其他的都叫做“郊区”，是行政意义上的郊区。,RL2,"  
The author is discussing how areas were originally defined under administrative division. They clarify that aside from the original core area (中山路开元), other regions were officially categorized as ""suburbs"" — emphasizing that this is an administrative classification rather than a personal or cultural perception.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""最早划分行政区"" (originally divided administratively): points to the use of administrative boundaries.
- ""叫做‘郊区’"" (called ""suburbs""): indicates a formal administrative designation.
- ""行政意义上的郊区"" (suburbs in the administrative sense): explicitly defines the classification as administrative.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not expressing personal identity or preference but is instead explaining how ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas were officially defined through administrative legitimacy. This serves as a historical and structural basis for understanding spatial identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that administrative designation is the standard used to define which areas are considered core or peripheral in the context of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), as it focuses on how official administrative boundaries and designations (e.g., ""suburbs"") are used to define local areas and, by extension, local identity.

The author is explaining a perceived mismatch between current administrative boundaries and historical or habitual understandings of what ""counts as厦门"" (Xiamen). They emphasize that historically, ""Xiamen"" referred specifically to the old urban core around Zhongshan Road, and that areas like Haicang, Jimei, and Tong’an were once external to it. The author also implies that Xiang’an is still seen as part of Tong’an, not as a separate or equal part of the ""core"" Xiamen identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""海沧、集美、同安现在属于厦门地区"" (Haicang, Jimei, Tong’an now belong to Xiamen): administrative change.  
- ""历史上厦门属于它们，它们不属于厦门"" (Historically, Xiamen belonged to them, not the other way around): historical spatial perception.  
- ""厦门确实只指中山路一带的老市区"" (Xiamen indeed only refers to the old downtown around Zhongshan Road): vernacular spatial cognition.  
- ""翔安就是同安的一部分"" (Xiang’an is part of Tong’an): reflects ongoing spatial perception and boundary understanding.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not merely stating administrative facts but is **emphasizing a distinction between administrative definitions and the historically sedimented, socially shared understanding of what constitutes the ""true"" or ""core"" Xiamen**. This reflects a **socially habitual and symbolic understanding of spatial boundaries**, which is used to define who or what counts as ""local"" in terms of identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that the **true Xiamen is still defined by the old urban core**, and that other areas, despite current administrative inclusion, are not fully integrated into the symbolic or habitual understanding of the local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is using **historical and socially habitual understandings of space**—not just current administrative divisions—to define what counts as the real or core ""Xiamen"" and, by implication, who counts as a ""true"" local.

The author provides a historical account of how the administrative and spatial boundaries of Xiamen have evolved over time—particularly the expansion of the Special Economic Zone and the integration of surrounding areas (Jimei, Haicang, Tong’an, Xiang’an) into the city structure. They challenge the idea that people from Jimei or Tong’an are not “Xiamen people,” arguing instead that these areas have their own long-standing local identities (e.g., “Jimei people,” “Guangu people”) rooted in historical and social convention. The author implicitly supports the idea that local identity is tied to long-standing regional consciousness and naming traditions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of historical spatial evolution (e.g., “Economic特区一开始只有湖里,” “后来建设海湾型城市”) reflect changes in spatial perception and administrative structure.  
- Emphasis on names like “Jimei people,” “Guangu people,” and the idea that “they’ve been Jimei people for so many years” reflect a sense of rooted local identity tied to place names and social perception.  
- The author disputes the idea of a single, unified “Xiamen identity” that erases historical distinctions, suggesting instead that local identity is based on long-standing regional consciousness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses historical and habitual regional naming practices to argue that people from areas like Jimei and Tong’an have their own distinct local identities, rather than being simply “Xiamen people.” This reflects a belief that local identity is defined not just by current administrative boundaries but by long-standing social and cultural perceptions of place.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that local identity is shaped by long-standing social perceptions of space and place names—i.e., **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**—and uses this to challenge overly administrative or newly imposed views of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author emphasizes the persistence of local identity based on historical naming and spatial perception, rather than administrative reorganization.

好家伙 我以为厦门岛内房价应该不会太高 想着看看 结果一看 嗯～跟上海也差不多,None,"  
The author expresses surprise at the high housing prices in Xiamen Island, comparing them to Shanghai-level prices. This indicates a reaction to the economic value and perhaps the social status associated with living in Xiamen Island. However, the text does **not** make any explicit or implicit claim about who counts as a ""local"" person or what defines ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xiamen Island housing prices are not too high"" → initial expectation about property prices.  
- ""Housing prices are similar to Shanghai"" → comparison of economic value.  
- No mention of **local identity**, **belonging**, **who is considered local**, or any **criteria** (administrative, linguistic, rootedness, etc.) used to define ""local people.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is **no argument** being made about local identity or its criteria. The text is a **personal reflection on property prices**, not a discussion of who is considered a local or what makes someone ""truly local."" The author is **not endorsing** or **implying** any standard for defining ""local people"" based on housing prices or economic factors.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Since the author is **not** making any claim about ""local identity"" or its defining criteria, **no RL category applies**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

我小时候 只有这个区域我们理解为厦门，其他我们称之为岛外。但随着现在资源拓宽厦门理解的更广了。,RL1,"  
The author is describing a shift in how the concept of ""Xiamen"" is understood — originally limited to a core area (referred to as ""this area"") and everything else was called ""outside the island"" (岛外). However, with the expansion of resources and development, the understanding of what ""Xiamen"" encompasses has broadened. This reflects a change in **socially shared spatial cognition** about which areas are considered part of the local core or periphery.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Only this area was considered Xiamen"" indicates a historically rooted, habitual perception of the city.
- ""Other areas were called outside the island (岛外)"" reflects a symbolic boundary based on shared local perception, not administrative division.
- ""Now resources have expanded, and the understanding of Xiamen has broadened"" implies that the **social perception of local space is evolving**, but still rooted in a shared cognitive framework.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not using administrative boundaries, family history, language, or economic factors as the **core standard** for defining local identity. Instead, they are emphasizing a **shared, habitual understanding of urban space** — what areas are symbolically or cognitively considered part of ""Xiamen"" — and how that perception has changed over time.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that **local identity is shaped by a shared, habitual understanding of urban spatial boundaries**, and that this perception has evolved with development. This is consistent with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects the author’s belief that local identity is tied to **socially shared and historically rooted spatial perceptions**, such as what areas are symbolically considered part of the city. This aligns directly with **RL1**, which focuses on **collective emotional maps and habitual spatial cognition** as markers of local identity.

The author emphasizes that **having a house in Xiamen** and **wanting to return to work in Xiamen after studying elsewhere** are signs of being a ""true local."" They also praise Xiamen's **urban environment, education, transportation, and medical resources**, suggesting that these factors contribute to the city's quality of life and desirability. However, these are framed in the context of affirming the city's value and attractiveness rather than defining who is or isn't a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""As long as in Xiamen have a house many want to return to work""** → property ownership and return migration behavior (RL6).  
- **""Xiamen's environment is very good""**, **""education, transportation, medical resources are online""**, **""people are not too many""** → urban livability and environmental quality (RL5).  
- **Comparison with other cities (Fuzhou, Hong Kong, global cities)** → evaluative context but not directly tied to defining ""local identity"".

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
- **Property ownership and return migration** are framed as behaviors characteristic of locals, implying that **staying connected to the city through property and work** is part of being a ""true local"" (RL6).  
- The **positive evaluation of urban livability** (environment, amenities, population density) is used to **justify the city’s desirability**, but **not explicitly to define who is ""local""**. Thus, RL5 is **not strongly endorsed** as a defining standard for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **clearly endorses** the idea that **owning property and intending to return to work in Xiamen** are signs of local attachment and belonging.  
- The **livability features** are used more for **praising the city** than for **defining local identity**, so they **do not qualify** for RL5 annotation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:

The author is asking a question about housing prices in Xiamen, expressing surprise or confusion about the high cost. There is no explicit or implicit discussion about how ""local people"" are defined, nor any criteria being endorsed by the author for judging local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xiamen房价这么高"" (Xiamen's housing prices are so high) refers to economic conditions or property values, but there is no indication that the author is using this to define or evaluate ""local people"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument being made about who counts as ""local"" or what defines local identity. The text is simply a question about housing prices, which is unrelated to the definition of ""local people.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
No criteria related to defining ""local identity"" are being endorsed or even referenced by the author.

听说厦门的房价都是隔壁市区的富商炒起来的,RL6,"  
The author is expressing a belief that the high housing prices in Xiamen are not primarily driven by local residents, but rather by wealthy businesspeople from neighboring districts who are ""炒房"" (speculating on property). This implies a contrast between ""true locals"" and external investors, with the latter being seen as distorting the local housing market.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""隔壁市区的富商"" (wealthy businessmen from neighboring districts) refers to external economic actors.
- ""炒起来的"" (driven up) suggests these individuals are acting as economic agents influencing the local real estate market.
- The statement implies that these people are not ""locals"" but are affecting the local area in significant ways, particularly through property speculation.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a distinction between ""locals"" (implied as the baseline) and external wealthy individuals who are disrupting the local housing market. Although the focus is on economic behavior, the underlying logic is that these outsiders—due to their economic power and non-local status—are altering the character of the local area, which indirectly reinforces a boundary around who counts as ""local"" and who is seen as an external force.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that economic behavior (such as property speculation) by non-locals can be used to distinguish between insiders and outsiders, which in turn affects how local identity is perceived or threatened. This ties to **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)**, as it involves the use of economic status and property investment behavior to distinguish between locals and non-locals.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
While the text does not explicitly mention social networks or long-term rootedness, it does imply that the ""true locals"" are being priced out or overshadowed by external actors with greater financial power. This reflects a concern about the erosion of local identity through economic forces, particularly real estate speculation, which falls under **RL6**, as it involves economic status and property ownership as symbolic markers of belonging or exclusion.

The author expresses frustration with traffic congestion, parking difficulties, and high housing prices. These are complaints about urban living conditions but are not clearly linked to any standard for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating who counts as a ""local person.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""堵车"" (traffic congestion), ""不好停车"" (difficulty parking), ""房价高"" (high housing prices) are all negative evaluations of urban functionality and living conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
None of the expressions serve to define or evaluate ""local identity."" They are complaints about urban life quality, but the author does not suggest that these factors determine who is considered a ""local"" or what kind of area is more ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
There is no endorsement or use of any standard for defining ""local people"" or ""local areas."" The author is merely describing urban challenges without linking them to identity boundaries or evaluative standards of localness.

The author contrasts two groups: (1) themselves and childhood friends who are ""土生土长"" (born and raised) in Qingxiu District — a traditional core area of Nanning; and (2) newer residents in the ASEAN Business District or those who moved from townships during high school. The author implicitly critiques the ""superiority complex"" of the latter group, suggesting that only long-term rootedness in the city, especially from childhood, constitutes authentic ""local"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""土生土长从小到大"" (born and raised from childhood to adulthood) — indicates deep personal and generational connection to the area.
- Mention of ""新南宁人"" (new Nanning people) — implies a distinction between ""new"" and ""old"" locals.
- Implicit judgment that people who moved in later (especially from townships) lack authentic local status despite living in the city now.
- The author does not use administrative boundaries, language, or economic status as explicit criteria, but focuses on rootedness and generational presence.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author uses their own upbringing and long-term presence in Qingxiu as a basis to question the legitimacy of others' local identity. This establishes a hierarchy where long-term, generational presence in a core area defines ""true localness,"" while newer arrivals — even if now living in the city — are seen as lacking that foundation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author clearly endorses **family rootedness and individual growth history in the local area** as the standard for judging ""who counts as a real local."" They implicitly reject other criteria like current residence or social attitude (e.g., ""superiority complex"").

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author defines ""real local"" status based on being born and raised in the area over a long period, especially from childhood, and contrasts this with newer arrivals or migrants.

青秀区以前不就是大农村吗小时候在埌西，西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷，后面一几年到东盟商务区买房，也是几千块一平而已,RL1,"  
The author reflects on how certain areas (e.g., Qingxiu District) were once perceived as rural and looked down upon (e.g., being seen as poor by classmates from Xixiangtang), but later became part of the city's core development (e.g., the ASEAN Business District), which the author's family participated in through property purchase. This reflects a shift in spatial perception and identity tied to both **area transformation** and **residential choice**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""青秀区以前不就是大农村吗"" (Qingxiu District used to be a big rural area) — reflects **historical spatial perception** and its change over time.
- ""西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷"" (classmates thought my family was poor) — implies **social evaluation based on area**, but not necessarily defining ""localness"" itself.
- ""到东盟商务区买房"" (bought a house in the ASEAN Business District) — reflects **residential mobility and aspiration**, possibly linked to **urban identity**.
- ""几千块一平而已"" (only a few thousand per square meter) — emphasizes **affordability and timing**, not directly tied to local identity definition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key logic is that **Qingxiu used to be rural but is now part of the urban core**, and the author's **residential choice in this area** reflects a transformation in both **spatial identity** and **personal status**. However, the author does not clearly endorse a standard for defining ""local people"" based on property ownership or economic status (RL6), nor does the author emphasize **linguistic**, **administrative**, or **occupational** criteria.

What the author **does emphasize** is the **change in perception and status of Qingxiu as a spatial entity** — from rural to urban, from looked-down-upon to part of the city core — and how this affects **who is considered part of the local urban identity**. This aligns with **RL1**, which focuses on **habitual, socially shared spatial cognition** and **historical sedimentation of area meaning** in defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses and implicitly conveys that **area perception and transformation** (from rural to urban) are used to define or reflect **local identity boundaries**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a **shared understanding of area transformation and its impact on local identity**, rather than administrative boundaries, family history, or economic status.

所以说啊，青秀区土著能有啥优越感啊，我小时候在医科大那边，去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑,RL1,"  
The author is challenging the idea that ""native"" status in a certain area (青秀区, Qingxiu District) should carry any sense of superiority. They support this by referencing their own childhood experiences — growing up near a medical university and frequently going to areas like Chaoyang and Xixiangtang for leisure, implying that these areas had greater cultural or commercial significance or吸引力. This suggests that the author does not认同 (认同:认同) the Qingxiu土著 (natives) as having a privileged or central local identity, and instead sees other areas as more representative of ""local"" life.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “青秀区土著能有啥优越感啊” (What superiority can Qingxiu District natives have?) implies a critique of claims to local identity based on birth or long-term residence.  
- “我小时候在医科大那边” (I grew up near the medical university) indicates the author's personal rootedness in a specific area.  
- “去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑” (To play or go shopping, we had to go to Chaoyang and Xixiangtang) implies a habitual spatial cognition of where the ""real"" or ""central"" local activity happens — not in Qingxiu.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is implicitly arguing that ""local identity"" or centrality is not defined by being a native of Qingxiu District, but rather by alignment with areas that are more culturally or functionally active — areas like Chaoyang and Xixiangtang. The author’s childhood experience supports their legitimacy in making this judgment and reflects their own spatial cognition of where ""localness"" is concentrated.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a **habitual or socially accepted spatial cognition** of where the core ""local"" areas are — Chaoyang and Xixiangtang — and by contrast, rejects Qingxiu as a privileged site of local identity. This is not about administrative boundaries, family history, language, or economic status, but about **shared cultural or spatial perception** of where the city's local life is centered.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses their own and presumably shared understandings of which areas are considered the real or core local spaces, and uses this to challenge the supposed superiority of Qingxiu natives.

朝阳广场的人流大而且确实鱼龙混杂啊，但是正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好,RL4,"  
The author acknowledges that while Chaoyang Square has a large and mixed crowd, ""authentic Nanning people"" would not say it's bad. This implies that there is a cultural or emotional attachment to the area, and that speaking positively about it is part of identifying as a ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Authentic Nanning people"" suggests a category of people with legitimate local identity.  
- ""Would not say朝阳 (Chaoyang) is bad"" implies a shared cultural or emotional evaluation of the area as part of local identity.  
- The contrast between the area's physical or social conditions and the stance of ""true locals"" suggests that identity is based on cultural loyalty rather than objective conditions.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that being a ""true local"" (正宗南宁人) involves a shared cultural sentiment — not criticizing certain areas — even if those areas have undesirable traits. This reflects a cultural or linguistic boundary marker, where expressing a certain attitude toward a local space becomes a way of signaling belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that cultural attitudes — such as not criticizing a local landmark — are part of what defines a ""true local."" This is not about administrative boundaries, family history, or economic status, but rather about shared cultural perception and emotional attachment.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, as the author uses shared cultural attitudes and emotional responses to a place as a boundary marker between ""authentic locals"" and others.

西乡塘很多城中村，朝阳广场附近的地铁站就有好几个站点是城中村，建筑大部分是新旧混杂，没有青秀五象的城建新，但是人多，热闹，图生活方便的话住这里挺好的，毕竟什么动物园火车站朝阳都在这里。,RL5,"  
The author is describing the characteristics of Xixiangtang (西乡塘), emphasizing its mixed urban landscape, presence of villages within the city (城中村), and its functional convenience (e.g., proximity to key facilities like the zoo, train station, Chaoyang). They also note that it is ""lively"" and suitable for living due to its convenience, despite not being as newly developed as areas like Qingxiu or Wuxiang. This reflects a positive evaluation of the area’s livability and functionality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""很多城中村"" (many villages within the city) and ""建筑大部分是新旧混杂"" (buildings are a mix of old and new) indicate a less ""modern"" or ""newly developed"" urban environment.  
- ""没有青秀五象的城建新"" (not as newly built as Qingxiu or Wuxiang) implies a comparison of urban development levels.  
- ""人多，热闹"" (crowded and lively), ""图生活方便"" (for convenience of life), ""动物园火车站朝阳都在这里"" (the zoo, train station, and Chaoyang are all here) highlight functional convenience and livability.  
- The overall tone suggests that despite its mixed urban form, the area is valued for its accessibility and daily living convenience.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates Xixiangtang as a desirable residential area not because of its modern appearance, but because of its functional convenience and accessibility to key facilities. They imply that such qualities make it a practical and suitable place to live, even if it doesn’t match the aesthetic or developmental standard of newer areas.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the area’s **functional livability**—its convenience for daily life, accessibility to facilities, and vibrant atmosphere—as a key reason for choosing to live there. This implies a standard for what constitutes a ""desirable"" or ""practical"" local area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text clearly reflects **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**, as the author uses the area’s functional advantages and convenience for daily life as the basis for evaluating it as a suitable place to live, thus linking it to their perception of local identity and area value.

不同区域的街头人群确实迥异，我来南宁生活十多年了，住的地方人流量相对低，平常上班下班很少逛街，最多去去附近万象城盛天地之类的。某次突发奇想坐地铁去朝阳广场（几年没去了），总记得那次的感觉。出地铁看到密密麻麻的人群，都还是年轻人居多，感觉城市非常有朝气，觉得很开心。,RL1,"  
The author describes how different areas of the city have distinct social atmospheres and population characteristics. Through personal experience, they contrast their usual low-traffic residential area with the bustling, youth-filled environment of朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square), expressing a sense of vibrancy and emotional connection to certain urban spaces.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""不同区域的街头人群确实迥异"" (The street crowds in different areas are indeed very different) – suggests spatial perception and emotional mapping of areas.  
- ""住的地方人流量相对低"" (The place I live has relatively low foot traffic), ""平常上班下班很少逛街"" (I rarely go shopping), ""最多去去附近万象城盛天地"" (only go to nearby malls) – implies habitual spatial behavior and emotional distance from certain urban cores.  
- ""坐地铁去朝阳广场"" (took the subway to Chaoyang Square), ""出地铁看到密密麻麻的人群...觉得城市非常有朝气"" (saw a dense crowd upon exiting the station...felt the city was full of vitality) – indicates emotional resonance with a specific urban area, symbolizing a kind of ""core"" local space.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly compares different areas not just in terms of physical characteristics, but in terms of their symbolic emotional and social meanings. The contrast between the quiet residential area and the lively Chaoyang Square reflects a kind of habitual, emotional spatial cognition — certain areas are seen as embodying the ""true"" spirit or vitality of the city, and thus, implicitly, as more ""local"" in identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a socially shared emotional mapping of urban space, where certain areas are symbolically more representative of the city and its identity than others.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses emotional and habitual spatial perceptions — such as the symbolic meaning of Chaoyang Square as a vibrant urban core — to define or evaluate the local character of a space.

别搞青秀区全区，我寻思着小时候住星湖路的从来没说过别的地方破，毕竟我们自己的房子也挺破。,RL1,"  
The author is expressing a sense of local identity rooted in shared experience and a kind of egalitarian local pride. They grew up in **Xinghu Road** (a specific location in Qingxiu District), and although their own housing conditions were poor, they never looked down on other parts of the district. This implies a **habitual, inclusive spatial identity** within Qingxiu District — that is, a **socially shared understanding** of what areas ""belong"" together and who counts as local.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""青秀区全区"" (the entire Qingxiu District) – indicates a spatial framework or boundary the author is responding to.
- ""小时候住星湖路"" (grew up on Xinghu Road) – indicates personal rootedness and spatial identity.
- ""从来没说过别的地方破"" (never said other areas were rundown) – shows **inclusive local perception**, rejecting spatial hierarchy within the district.
- ""我们自己的房子也挺破"" (our own house was rundown too) – reinforces the idea that **shared conditions do not exclude one from local identity**, thus affirming a **habitual, collective spatial belonging**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is defending a **habitual, inclusive, and historically grounded perception of Qingxiu District** — that people from Xinghu Road don’t look down on others within the same district, even if their own conditions were similar or poor. This reflects a **socially shared, habitual spatial identity**, not based on administrative boundaries or material conditions, but on **local perception and emotional belonging**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a **habitual, inclusive understanding of local identity** based on shared experience and **local spatial perception**, not on administrative status, material conditions, or cultural markers.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author is drawing on a **shared, habitual, and historically sedimented local perception** of intra-district spatial identity — rejecting a more exclusionary or hierarchical spatial view.

The author is mocking the sense of superiority expressed by certain residents in a rundown neighborhood in Nanning, who claim to be ""local people"" based on their residential identity, despite the poor quality of the area. The author contrasts this with their own background from a less prestigious area (""mountain旮旯 Jianzheng Road"") and clearly criticizes this form of local identity-based hierarchy as narrow-minded and unfounded.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- Mention of specific areas: 青秀区 (Qingxiu District), 江南区 (Jiangnan District), 亭洪供电局 (Tinghong Power Supply Bureau), 某桥底下 (under a certain bridge), 建政路 (Jianzheng Road), indicating spatial identity labels.
- The phrase “我们家是南宁本地人哦，是本地人来的” (“We are real Nanning locals”) reflects a claim to local identity.
- The author critiques the notion of using such local identity to assert superiority, especially in a context where the area is objectively rundown.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author does **not** endorse the logic that being a ""local"" (e.g., living in a certain area of Nanning) equates to superiority or authentic local identity. On the contrary, the author **explicitly resists and mocks** this idea, pointing out the irony and absurdity of claiming local superiority in a run-down area. The author implies that such claims are based on outdated or narrow-minded spatial identity markers.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** any of the criteria used by others to define ""local people"" (e.g., residential area, generational roots, etc.). Instead, the author **criticizes** these criteria as baseless and superficial.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author **explicitly rejects** the criteria others use to define ""local people"" and does not propose or endorse any alternative standards for defining local identity themselves, **no RL categories apply**.

本南宁人小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩啊，只是后来长大了，能选择的地方也多了，朝阳又越来越难停车（小车和电车都难），所以才去的少了,RL1,"  
The author reflects on their personal experience as a ""native Nanning person"" and recalls that as a child, they and their friends would often meet in Chaoyang (likely referring to a specific local area or district). However, as they grew older and had more choices, they visited less frequently due to increasing parking difficulties for both cars and electric vehicles. This implies a change in behavior influenced by environmental conditions, but also hints at an emotional connection to the area rooted in childhood habits.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""本南宁人"" (native Nanning person): indicates a self-identification with local identity.
- ""小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩"" (used to meet friends in Chaoyang as kids): reflects long-standing local social habits and spatial associations.
- ""朝阳又越来越难停车"" (parking in Chaoyang has become increasingly difficult): refers to functional livability and convenience.
- ""能选择的地方也多了"" (now there are more places to choose from): suggests a shift in spatial behavior due to expanded options.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's childhood habit of gathering in Chaoyang reflects a historically sedimented, socially shared spatial practice among locals. The mention of parking difficulties indicates how changes in functional livability affect current behavior. However, the emotional tone suggests that Chaoyang still holds symbolic meaning as a ""local"" space, even if it's visited less now.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author implicitly endorses the idea that Chaoyang has long been a socially recognized and habitually used space among locals — this aligns with **RL1** (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author also notes how functional aspects like parking difficulty affect current usage — but this is framed more as a practical change rather than a shift in how ""localness"" is defined. It does not serve as a **standard** for defining local identity, so **RL5 is not applicable**.
- The author’s self-identification as a “native Nanning person” is background context, not a standard for defining local identity — so **RL3** (Family Rootedness) is not directly supported.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text primarily reflects the author’s view that Chaoyang has historically functioned as a shared, socially recognized space for locals — a habitual and symbolic location within local spatial cognition. This aligns with **RL1**, which focuses on shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of space used to define or symbolize local identity.

早期南宁各类资本大佬聚会碰头也是在朝阳的 那时候南宁不大的 以朝阳为圆心 以前的老万国酒楼就是那些大老板谈生意地方喽,RL1,"  
The author is reminiscing about an earlier era in Nanning when the city was smaller and the Chaoyang area served as the central hub. It was the core area where influential people gathered and conducted business, symbolizing the historical and spatial heart of the city. This implies a habitual, shared understanding of where the ""real"" or ""central"" Nanning is located.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""朝阳为圆心"" (Chaoyang as the center) indicates a spatial perception rooted in historical and habitual cognition.  
- ""老万国酒楼"" (Old Wanguo Restaurant) is mentioned as a symbolic place where capital elites gathered, reinforcing the centrality and symbolic meaning of the Chaoyang area.  
- The reference to the past and the city's growth implies a contrast between the core and peripheral areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses historical spatial cognition and symbolic places to define the core of Nanning and, by extension, who might be considered ""local."" The text implies that being connected to or originating from the Chaoyang area is central to local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a habitual and historically sedimented understanding of Chaoyang as the core area of Nanning, which carries symbolic and identity-based significance for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses shared historical and spatial perceptions—such as Chaoyang being the center and Wanguo Restaurant being a symbolic meeting place—to define the local core area and, by implication, who is considered ""local.""

哈哈哈我西乡塘农村的，我小时候去朝阳广场我也怕，特别是过天桥和地下通道的时候，就是有很多乞丐在那里然后会害怕,(none),"  
The author is humorously recalling a childhood experience of fear when visiting a central urban area (Chaoyang Square) from their rural part of Xixiangtang. The narrative centers on the contrast between rural upbringing and the intimidating experience of a city center, but **does not** present any explicit or implicit standard used to define ""local identity."" It is more about personal emotion and experience in a specific setting.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Xixiangtang rural"" refers to the speaker’s origin but is not used to define ""local identity"" in a normative or evaluative way.
- ""朝阳广场"" (Chaoyang Square), ""天桥"" (overpass), ""地下通道"" (underpass), and ""乞丐"" (beggars) describe the environment and the speaker’s emotional reaction, but do not serve as identity criteria.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, linguistic features, family history, social networks, or occupational typification being used to define who is or isn’t a local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument or standard being proposed by the author about what makes someone ""local."" The text is a personal anecdote about feeling out of place due to environmental factors (e.g., crowdedness, presence of beggars), not due to any symbolic ranking logic that defines ""local identity.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL elements are being used by the author to define or evaluate ""local people"" or to establish boundaries of local identity. The text is descriptive and emotional, not evaluative in terms of identity criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since no RL category is being used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity,"" **no RL label should be assigned**.

不是，我也南宁人，但不是青秀区的，出来10年了那里的人装逼成这样了吗青秀区是什么了不起的地方吗？房价多少啊？,(no RL category applies),"  
The author identifies as a ""Nanning person"" but not from Qingxiu District. They express frustration or sarcasm toward perceived arrogance or elitism among Qingxiu residents. The rhetorical questions about Qingxiu District's status and housing prices suggest the author believes Qingxiu is seen by some (perhaps its residents) as a special or superior area, and that this perception may be tied to material or symbolic status.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Not from Qingxiu District"" implies a spatial identity distinction.  
- ""There的人装逼成这样了吗"" (Have the people there become so pretentious?) suggests that Qingxiu residents may be seen as socially or spatially superior, based on where they live.  
- ""Qingxiu District is what kind of outstanding place?"" and ""What's the housing price?"" imply that the district is perceived as high-status or exclusive, potentially due to its economic or spatial attributes.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is critical of the perceived social hierarchy based on district affiliation. They question the legitimacy of Qingxiu’s elevated status, which implies that others may use Qingxiu residency (and by extension, its spatial and economic attributes) as a marker of superior local identity. The author does not personally endorse Qingxiu’s superiority but acknowledges that others may do so.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** personally endorse Qingxiu’s status as superior, but they **acknowledge** that others may use Qingxiu’s district identity (possibly tied to housing prices and social perception) to define a hierarchy of local identity.

However, per the annotation principles, we only annotate **criteria the author themselves endorses** for defining ""local identity."" Since the author is **critical** of this standard, it should **not** be annotated.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text implies that some people may use Qingxiu’s district identity (possibly involving RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority or RL5: Functional Livability) to define a superior local identity, the author clearly **resists** this standard rather than endorsing it.

没事啦，反正法国人看东南亚人（对就是她口中的东盟商务区）都像在看自己的殖民地人群不知道在狂什么，真的好笑（哦我土生土长南宁人）,RL3,"  
The author makes a humorous observation about how some people (referred to as viewing Southeast Asians through a colonial lens) behave arrogantly toward others, and contrasts this with their own identity as a ""土生土长南宁人"" (""born and raised Nanning native""). This self-identification is central to their sense of local belonging and is used to position themselves in contrast to others who may not have the same rootedness.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长南宁人"" (""born and raised Nanning native"") clearly indicates a sense of deep-rooted local identity based on generational belonging and upbringing in the area.  
- The mention of ""东盟商务区"" (""ASEAN Business District"") refers to a space associated with international or migrant populations, which the author implicitly contrasts with their own local identity.  
- The tone is self-assured and emphasizes authenticity of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The phrase ""土生土长南宁人"" is used to assert the author's authentic local identity and distinguish themselves from others who may not have the same depth of local connection. This reflects a belief that being born and raised in a place is a legitimate and meaningful standard for defining who is truly ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly and proudly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised"" in Nanning is a valid and meaningful basis for local identity. This is not just a personal fact but is used to contrast with others who may not meet this standard, implying its importance in defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as the author uses the idea of being ""born and raised here"" as the basis for asserting authentic local identity.

本广西人现在是“地铁老人脸”。这都还没富起来呢，就开始拿起贵族姿态了我们偏远农村的广西人看来只能下广东或者出国了。不配奢望首府,RL1,"  
The author, identifying as a Guangxi native, expresses frustration and marginalization. They feel that while they come from a rural, less developed part of Guangxi (""偏远农村""), they are not accepted or valued in the regional capital (""首府"" / capital), and instead face a kind of elitism or exclusion. The phrase “地铁老人脸” (literally ""metro old man face"") is used self-deprecatingly to imply being old, out-of-place, and perhaps out-of-step with the urban elite. The author also implies that people like them must leave Guangxi — either to Guangdong or overseas — to seek better opportunities.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""偏远农村"" (remote rural areas) suggests a spatial hierarchy of belonging — implying a center-periphery identity structure.
- ""不配奢望首府"" (not worthy of dreaming about the capital) implies a symbolic boundary between the capital and rural areas.
- The self-identification as a ""本广西人"" (native Guangxi person) who is excluded from the capital suggests a contested sense of local belonging.
- The mention of ""地铁老人脸"" (metro old man face) implies a sense of being out of place in urban spaces, possibly due to appearance, accent, or background.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not defining who is ""local"" in a positive or authoritative way. Instead, they are critiquing a system in which rural people from the same province are excluded from the capital city and treated as second-class locals. However, the author implicitly endorses the idea that there is a symbolic spatial hierarchy — where capital city residents are seen as more ""urban"" or ""advanced"" — and that this hierarchy is used to exclude rural locals from full participation in the local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author is critical of the exclusion they face, they **implicitly accept** the notion that capital city residents are seen as more legitimate locals, and that rural locals are marginalized within the same province. This reflects a **vernacular spatial hierarchy** — a socially accepted perception of which areas ""count"" more in terms of local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author accepts and reflects a shared perception that people from the capital city are seen as more ""authentic"" locals, while rural people, even if from the same province, are seen as outsiders or less legitimate. This is not based on administrative boundaries (RL2), family roots (RL3), language (RL4), or economic status (RL6), but on a **socially sedimented spatial hierarchy** of local belonging.

The author reflects on their deep emotional attachment to the old city area (""土著对老城区的执念"") and emphasizes that this attachment stems from having ""grown up there"" (""从小到大生活学习的地方""). They contrast this with their current residence in the Wuxiang district, which, although geographically close to Qingxiu (just ""一过桥就可以回到青秀""), still feels inconvenient due to longer commute times. The author implies that **true local identity is tied to growing up in the old city**, and that this upbringing shapes expectations for daily life (e.g., expecting a 5-minute commute).

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/native people), ""老城区"" (old city area) — references to a specific local group and location.  
- ""从小到大生活学习的地方"" — indicates long-term upbringing and family rootedness in the old city.  
- ""五象这套房"" (this apartment in Wuxiang), ""南宁大桥头"" (at the head of Nanning Bridge), ""一过桥就可以回到青秀"" — geographic references showing proximity but contrasting with emotional distance.  
- ""不习惯通勤"" (not used to commuting), ""习惯了5分钟就到"" (used to a 5-minute commute) — reflects how upbringing shapes lifestyle expectations and sense of place.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author clearly associates being a ""土著"" (native/local) with having grown up in the old city. This upbringing creates a deep emotional bond and a habitual lifestyle (e.g., expecting short commutes), which the author contrasts with life in a newer district. This implies that **growing up in a specific area is a core standard for being considered a ""true local.""**

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that growing up in a place (especially the old city) is what defines being a local (""土著对老城区的执念是比较深的毕竟是从小到大生活学习的地方""). Other elements (like commute time) are used to illustrate this deeper rootedness-based identity.

青秀区我有两套了，这边这套是我们的单位集资房，我们有股份，可以得分红，而且是按照职称高低才能买房子的大小，所以我爸说买咯。,RL6,"  
The author mentions owning two properties in Qingxiu District, with one being a **unit-funded housing unit** (a type of work-unit-based housing common in China), and emphasizes that ownership is tied to **workplace status** (""according to job title level to determine house size"") and that there is a **financial stake** (""we have shares, can get dividends""). This reflects a belief that **local identity** is tied not just to residence, but to **institutional integration**, **social capital**, and **embedded economic benefits**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""I have two sets"" — indicates property ownership as a marker of local settlement.  
- ""Unit集资房 (unit-funded housing)"" — reflects a housing type tied to workplace or institutional membership.  
- ""We have shares, can get dividends"" — indicates embedded economic benefits linked to local institutions.  
- ""According to job title level to determine house size"" — highlights workplace status and institutional hierarchy.  
- ""My father said to buy it"" — implies generational endorsement of this form of local social and economic integration.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that **true local belonging** involves **deep institutional and social integration**, including **workplace-based housing**, **economic participation**, and **entitlement to benefits** like dividends. These are not just markers of wealth or convenience, but of **established local status** and **entitlement**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and describes **property ownership within a local institutional framework**, **workplace-based housing rights**, and **entitlement to dividends** as part of their lived experience and family decision-making — all of which reflect **social embeddedness** in the local system.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a **social embeddedness** logic (RL6), where the author sees **local identity** as being tied to **institutional integration**, **ownership of embedded assets**, and **access to local social and economic privileges**.

住惯单位宿舍的不习惯住商业小区。每次想吃什么都要回老城区，特别是吃宵夜，动不动开车大半个小时，心鸭。这两天又把我崽拎回娘家蹭住，为了今晚能去琅东村觅食,RL1,"  
The author expresses a habitual preference for living in older, more familiar urban areas (老城区), especially for lifestyle and cultural habits such as eating late-night snacks (宵夜). They find it inconvenient to live in a commercial housing complex that is disconnected from these habits, and thus frequently return to their hometown or family residence for comfort. This reflects a sense of spatial belonging rooted in habit and cultural lifestyle.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “住惯单位宿舍的不习惯住商业小区” (Those used to living in unit dorms find it hard to adapt to commercial housing complexes): reflects a habitual spatial and lifestyle identity.  
- “每次想吃什么都要回老城区” (Every time I want to eat something, I have to go back to the old城区): indicates emotional and habitual attachment to the old城区.  
- “动不动开车大半个小时” (Sometimes it takes more than half an hour by car): highlights spatial inconvenience, but more importantly, implies emotional distance from non-core areas.  
- “去琅东村觅食” (Go to Langdong Village to find food): emphasizes the symbolic and habitual meaning of certain areas for cultural and lifestyle practices.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly defines “local” not through administrative boundaries or family roots, but through **habitual spatial orientation** and **emotional connection to certain areas**—especially the old城区 and places like Langdong Village—used to fulfill lifestyle needs and maintain a sense of familiarity and belonging. This reflects a socially shared, habitual perception of space that defines where “we” belong and where “they” don’t.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a habitual and symbolic perception of space—centered on the old城区 and culturally significant villages—as the core of their local identity and lifestyle, contrasting it with newer, more detached commercial housing areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author defines “local” identity through habitual, emotionally rooted, and socially shared spatial perceptions, not official boundaries or administrative divisions.

我闺蜜前年搬去了五象，每次在五象湖地铁站出口下车出来就感觉瞬间从城市到了荒郊野岭要走一大段路才有点生活气息，给我住我真不习惯,RL5,"  
The author is describing their discomfort with the **livability and environmental quality** of the Wuxiang area. They feel that upon exiting the subway at Wuxiang Lake station, the surroundings feel desolate and lack the ""urban vibe"" — it's like moving from a city to a remote area. They emphasize the **lack of immediate amenities and convenience**, which makes it hard for them to adapt to living there.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""从城市到了荒郊野岭"" (from the city to a remote wilderness): Indicates a **sharp contrast in perceived urban quality**.  
- ""要走一大段路才有点生活气息"" (have to walk a long way before seeing any sign of daily life): Highlights **lack of immediate functional convenience and amenities**.  
- ""给我住我真不习惯"" (if I had to live here, I really wouldn’t get used to it): Shows a **personal standard of livability and environmental comfort**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is evaluating Wuxiang as a **less desirable local residential area** due to its **lack of convenient urban infrastructure and amenities**, which they use to justify their discomfort with the place. This implies a **standard for what constitutes a ""livable"" or ""urban"" local area**, and by extension, what kind of area they would associate with being ""genuinely local"" or desirable.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly expresses that **functional livability and environmental quality** (e.g., proximity to amenities, urban atmosphere) are important to them in choosing or evaluating a local area. They **implicitly endorse** these as criteria for what makes a place ""truly local"" or suitable for local living.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a judgment of the **quality of a local area** based on **functional livability and environmental comfort**, which aligns directly with **RL5**.

南宁大桥头，那个位置好好，就是早晚高峰过桥很崩溃,none,"  
The author expresses a generally positive view of the location ""Nanning Bridgehead"" (南宁大桥头), indicating that it is a desirable place (""that location is really good""), while also mentioning a drawback related to traffic congestion during peak hours when crossing the bridge. The main focus is on the quality of the location, with the traffic issue serving as a critique of its functional convenience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Nanning Bridgehead"" — a specific place name, potentially related to **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** if it carries habitual or symbolic local meaning.
- ""That location is really good"" — a positive evaluation of the area, which could be linked to **RL5 (Functional Livability)** if tied to convenience, infrastructure, or environmental quality.
- ""Morning and evening rush hour crossing the bridge is maddening"" — a critique of transportation functionality, also potentially linked to **RL5**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author evaluates the area positively overall but highlights a specific inconvenience related to transportation. However, there is **no explicit or implicit statement** that ties this evaluation to the **definition of ""local people"" identity**. The author does not suggest that living in this area, or experiencing traffic on the bridge, is a standard for judging who is ""local"" or what counts as a ""local"" area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text contains evaluative statements about the area's livability and transportation, **none of these are used by the author to define or judge ""local identity""**. The author does not propose or imply any criteria (e.g., spatial belonging, administrative status, family rootedness, language, etc.) that would be used to distinguish ""locals"" from ""non-locals"".

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the text does **not** contain any **author-endorsed standard or logic** used to define ""local identity"", **no RL category applies**.

医科大自己在五象蟠龙这边都起有集资房，去要被服厂干嘛没听说过哦。当时说武鸣校区都附近准备起集资房，我老豆老母都冲咋咋报，结果木戳有地铁过去，不要了,RL5,"  
The author is expressing a decision-making logic regarding residential choices, influenced by the presence or absence of **infrastructure development**, particularly **transportation convenience (e.g., metro access)** and **availability of staff housing (集资房)**. They reference their parents’ eagerness to apply for housing near the Wuming Campus, which they later abandoned due to the **lack of metro access**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""医科大自己在五象蟠龙这边都起有集资房"" – Mentions university-provided housing (a form of embedded social benefit).
- ""武鸣校区都附近准备起集资房"" – Another housing opportunity linked to employment or institutional affiliation.
- ""我老豆老母都冲咋咋报"" – Parents were eager to apply, indicating that such housing is seen as valuable or desirable.
- ""结果木戳有地铁过去，不要了"" – The lack of metro access led to rejection, highlighting **transportation convenience** as a decisive factor.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implicitly uses **functional livability**—especially **transportation convenience (presence of metro)**—as a **key standard for evaluating the desirability and suitability of a residential area**, even when other benefits (like institutional housing) are present.

While the text mentions housing tied to employment (which could relate to RL6), the **core decision-making factor** is clearly the **lack of metro access**, which renders the housing undesirable. This indicates that **livability and convenience**, rather than social embeddedness or institutional ties, are the **primary evaluative criteria** in this context.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses** the presence of **transportation infrastructure (e.g., metro access)** as a **decisive factor in residential choice**, and by implication, what constitutes a **desirable or acceptable ""local"" living environment**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the **quality and desirability of a local residential area** based on **transportation convenience**, **infrastructure**, and **livability**, which are used as **standards for determining whether a place is worth living in** and thus potentially part of a desirable ""local"" space.

The author expresses a strong personal preference for the **living environment in the Wuxiang area**, highlighting aspects such as **wide roads with less traffic, good air quality, riverside walking, and convenient shopping and dining facilities**. They contrast this with the **congestion and inconvenience of the urban core (Qingxiu)**, suggesting that **Wuxiang offers a more livable and modern local lifestyle**.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""马路很宽不会堵车"" (wide roads without traffic jams)**  
- **""空气也很好傍晚饭后可以在江边散步"" (good air quality and riverside walking)**  
- **""吃的，购物也很方便"" (convenient food and shopping)**  
- **""山姆也就20分钟就到了"" (Sam's Club is 20 minutes away)**  
- **""回市区感觉哪哪都堵"" (the city center is congested everywhere)**  

These all point to **functional livability** — the **quality of infrastructure, environment, and daily convenience** — as a **key factor in the author’s evaluation of Wuxiang as a preferred local area**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses **livability features (transportation, environment, amenities)** to **positively evaluate Wuxiang as a desirable place to live**, and implicitly **contrasts it with the less desirable conditions of the older urban core**. This suggests that **these functional characteristics are not just preferences but are part of the author’s standard for what constitutes a “better” or more desirable local living area**.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **clearly endorses and values** the **livability and environmental quality of Wuxiang**, using them to justify their **preference for and identification with this area as a more ideal local space**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, where the **author uses material and environmental qualities (transportation, air, amenities, congestion)** to **evaluate and define what constitutes a desirable or “better” local area**, thus shaping their perception of local identity and spatial value.

大院长大，搬出大院，买到新的房，许多南宁人的轨迹也差不多是这样，再回到大院住也没曾经的的感觉，不符合现在的邻里关系了。老城区固然好，过去的终将也是过去了,RL1,"  
The author reflects on the changing nature of local identity and community in南宁 (Nanning), particularly in relation to **老城区 (old city area)** and **大院 (compound/large courtyard housing)**. They describe a common life trajectory — growing up in a compound, moving out to buy a new home, and then being unable to return to the same lifestyle. The author implies that while the old city and old living patterns had their charm, they no longer align with current social and living expectations.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""大院长大"" (grew up in a compound)** — indicates a formative local upbringing, possibly pointing to **RL3: Family Rootedness**.  
- **""买到新的房"" (bought a new house)** — suggests property ownership in new areas, possibly pointing to **RL6: Social Embeddedness**, though not strongly.  
- **""再回到大院住也没曾经的感觉"" (can’t get the old feeling back if returning to the compound)** — indicates a change in **social environment and neighborhood relations**, suggesting that past social norms no longer apply.  
- **""不符合现在的邻里关系"" (doesn’t fit the current neighborhood relations)** — highlights a shift in **social-cultural dynamics**, possibly pointing to **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition** or **RL6: Social Embeddedness**.  
- **""老城区固然好，过去的终将也是过去了"" (the old city is good, but the past is the past)** — reflects a **symbolic and emotional distancing from traditional spatial identity**, possibly pointing to **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not defining who is ""local"" based on administrative status, occupation, or language. Instead, they are expressing a **cultural and emotional shift** — the old way of life and spatial identity (compounds, old neighborhoods) no longer carry the same symbolic or social meaning. The author implies that **local identity is evolving**, and the **old spatial and social systems are no longer the standard** for defining what feels authentically local today.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does **not** define ""local people"" based on administrative boundaries, family history, or linguistic traits. They also do **not** suggest that economic status or property ownership is the standard for local identity.  
However, they do **implicitly convey that the old spatial-cultural system (compound life, old city neighborhoods) no longer functions as the symbolic standard for local identity**. This reflects a **change in vernacular spatial cognition** — the emotional and habitual understanding of where ""real"" local life is or was.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author reflects on how **habitual or emotionally significant spatial categories (like compounds and old neighborhoods)** once defined local identity, but are now seen as outdated or no longer relevant.

因为渝中的拆迁户基本上都在李家沱,(no label),"  
The author states that ""demolition relocation households from Yuzhong are basically in Lijiatuo,"" implying a movement or relocation of people due to urban redevelopment. However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly define who is or isn't a ""local person"" based on this movement. There is no evaluative standard or boundary drawn regarding ""local identity"" based on this relocation pattern.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Yuzhong"" and ""Lijiatuo"" are place names.  
- ""Demolition relocation households"" (拆迁户) refers to a specific socio-administrative group affected by urban development.  
- However, the sentence does not express the author’s endorsement of any standard for defining ""local people"" or evaluating local areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no argument or evaluative stance from the author about what makes someone a ""local person"" or what defines a ""local area."" The sentence is purely descriptive of a relocation pattern, not prescriptive or evaluative about identity or belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author does not endorse or imply any criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this sentence. The text lacks any evaluative or normative claim about who counts as ""local"" or what makes an area ""truly local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since no RL category is endorsed by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity,"" no RL label should be applied.

不会吧渝中区的拆迁户跑李家沱去干撒子，,RL1,"  
The author expresses surprise or disapproval of渝中区 (Yuzhong District) demolition resettlement households moving to 李家沱 (Lijiatuo), implying that such a move is inappropriate or socially incongruous. The statement suggests an implicit assumption that people from certain core urban areas (like Yuzhong District) should remain within or near their socially recognized spatial domain, and moving to a different area (like Lijiatuo) disrupts this expectation.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Reference to specific districts: 渝中区 (Yuzhong District) and 李家沱 (Lijiatuo), indicating spatial perception and symbolic meaning associated with these areas.  
- The author’s tone implies a belief that there is a socially habitual or expected spatial boundary for where certain groups (like demolition resettlement households) should live.  
- The statement reflects a shared or habitual understanding of intra-city spatial categories, particularly regarding who belongs where.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing on a socially shared spatial cognition that certain groups (e.g., original residents of Yuzhong District) should not relocate to areas like Lijiatuo, suggesting that these areas are symbolically or socially differentiated. This reflects a habitual or culturally sedimented perception of spatial legitimacy and local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a socially habitual understanding of spatial boundaries and local belonging, using it to question or criticize the movement of a specific group across these boundaries.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as it reflects a shared, habitual perception of spatial categories within the city, used to evaluate or imply who belongs where. The author is not appealing to administrative boundaries, economic status, or occupation, but rather to a socially sedimented understanding of where certain groups should be located.

The author uses ID number segments (""510203"", ""500104"") to indicate their and their father's administrative hukou origins, and the phrase ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) to emphasize that they were born and grew up locally. This expresses pride or identification with being a ""native"" or ""true local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""爸爸是510203我是500104"" reflects administrative hukou information.
- ""土生土长"" indicates being born and raised in the area, pointing to family rootedness.
- The use of ""ddk"" (abbreviation for ""地道本地人"" – authentic local person) further reinforces a sense of authentic local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Both administrative hukou origin and being ""born and raised here"" are used to assert a strong, authentic local identity. The author is making a claim about ""who counts as local"" based on both administrative belonging and generational rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both:
- Administrative legitimacy (RL2): Using hukou registration as a marker of local identity.
- Family rootedness (RL3): Emphasizing being ""土生土长"" as proof of being a ""true local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects both RL2 and RL3, as the author uses both administrative belonging and generational rootedness to define and assert their local identity.

小时候在南坪，现在在坡区，而且我爸妈又在考虑搬回南坪,RL1,"  
The author describes their personal residential history—growing up in Nanping, currently living in Po District, with their parents considering moving back to Nanping. This suggests a sense of emotional or habitual attachment to Nanping as a place of origin or familiarity, which plays a role in how they perceive their local identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候在南坪"" (Grew up in Nanping) implies a formative connection to the area.  
- ""现在在坡区"" (Now in Po District) indicates a current location different from the place of upbringing.  
- ""爸妈又在考虑搬回南坪"" (Parents are considering moving back to Nanping) reinforces the emotional or habitual pull toward Nanping.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that Nanping holds symbolic or emotional significance due to having grown up there. The fact that the parents are considering returning suggests that Nanping is seen as a more ""rooted"" or ""authentic"" local space in their perception. This reflects a habitual or emotional spatial cognition of ""localness"" tied to one's place of upbringing or long-term residence.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a sense of emotional or habitual attachment to one's place of origin (Nanping) as a factor in local identity. There is no explicit rejection of this idea, and the consideration of returning implies an implicit endorsement of its significance.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a habitual or emotional spatial认知 (认知 here refers to perception or understanding) of local identity—growing up in a place and feeling a pull to return is aligned with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, which involves shared or habitual perceptions of space that go beyond administrative boundaries and are rooted in emotional or symbolic meaning.

The author is describing their family migration history and generational differences in spatial perception. They clarify that although they are not a ""native"" (原住民), their family has deep roots in old urban areas (较场口, 摊子口). The author also highlights how their parents' perception of what constitutes the ""urban core"" (解放碑, 大坪) differs from current perceptions (照母山 now being seen as the center). The author now lives and works in a central area that was once perceived as peripheral, showing a shift in spatial cognition and identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **Family history of living in old urban areas (RL3):** ""我外婆80多了早些年住较场口，我妈小时候也住较场口，我爸住摊子口"" — indicates long-term family rootedness in traditional urban areas.  
- **Spatial perception and emotional mapping (RL1):** Parents' belief that ""解放碑附近才是城区"" and ""大坪也算城区"" reflects habitual or historical urban spatial cognition.  
- **Changing perception of urban boundaries (RL1 + RL5):** The shift from calling 照母山 ""荒郊野岭"" to now calling it ""宇宙中心"" shows evolving social consensus about spatial identity and urban development.  
- **Author's current residence and work location (RL6 might be implied):** Living and working in 照母山 may imply integration into local social and functional networks, but this is not explicitly used to define ""local identity.""

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is reflecting on how **family history** and **spatial perception** influence the sense of ""localness."" The author's family history in traditional urban areas and the contrast between past and present spatial cognition both serve to define what counts as ""local"" or ""urban"" in a symbolic and emotional sense.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author clearly endorses and reflects on **family rootedness in traditional urban areas** (RL3).  
- The author also implicitly endorses the **socially habitual spatial cognition** (RL1), particularly in describing how their parents and society at large perceive urban boundaries.  
- The author does **not** endorse administrative boundaries (RL2), language (RL4), or occupational identity (RL7) as criteria for local identity.  
- While there are hints of **livability and environmental change** (RL5), the author does not use these to define local identity directly.  
- Though there's a suggestion of **social integration** (RL6), it is not explicitly used to define ""localness.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects two key standards endorsed by the author in defining ""local identity"":  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author reflects on how traditional and habitual spatial perceptions (like ""城区"") shape local identity and how these perceptions evolve over time.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author emphasizes their family's long-term presence in traditional urban areas as part of their connection to the city and local identity.

500107，土生土长破区，现居两江新区。,RL3,"  
The author uses an ID card number prefix (500107) to reference their original administrative affiliation, and phrases like ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) to emphasize their deep family and personal roots in the original area (""破区"", a colloquial or depreciative term for a rundown district). They also state their current residence is in ""两江新区"" (Liangjiang New Area), indicating a contrast between their origin and present location. The phrase ""破区"" may also reflect a local identity shaped by growing up in a historically less-developed or stigmatized area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""500107"" — a specific ID card prefix, indicating administrative hukou origin.  
- ""土生土长"" — clearly indicates family rootedness and long-term personal growth in the area.  
- ""破区"" — implies a historically defined spatial identity, possibly with a sense of pride or irony.  
- ""现居两江新区"" — current residence in a new development area, contrasting with the original rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key point the author is making is about their personal rootedness — being ""土生土长"" — in a specific, once-marginalized local area (""破区""), which they imply is central to their ""local"" identity. The ID card prefix reinforces this as an administrative fact. The contrast with their current residence in a newer, more developed district further highlights that the author sees their ""true"" local identity as rooted in their origin, not their current location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses ""土生土长"" — being born and raised in a specific area — as the core basis of their local identity. The ID card prefix (500107) supports this as an administrative marker, but the main evaluative standard is family and personal rootedness. There is no explicit endorsement of linguistic, spatial, or occupational criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The author's self-identification centers on being ""土生土长"" — born and raised in a historically defined area — which strongly aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**. The ID card prefix reinforces this rootedness but does not function as the primary evaluative standard on its own. The contrast with the new district also implies a sense of authenticity derived from long-term local growth history.

The author is sharing their personal residential history—growing up in two different areas of Chongqing (两路口 and 坡区/杨家坪). This reflects a long-term rootedness in specific urban neighborhoods, implying a sense of belonging and local identity formed through personal growth history in these areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候住两路口，八岁搬回坡区，就一直在杨家坪前后打转转了"" indicates a long-standing residential and developmental history within specific local areas.
- The author's life trajectory is tied to these districts, suggesting deep personal connection and local identification.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author’s identity appears to be shaped by their long-term presence and growth in these local neighborhoods. This implies that growing up and living continuously in certain urban districts contributes to their sense of being a ""local person.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that long-term residence and personal development history in a local area are key to forming a local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL3, which includes individuals' long-term growth history in a local area (especially in immigrant city contexts) as a basis for forming a ""local"" identity.

是不是开始有成都口音了,RL4,"  
The question ""是不是开始有成都口音了"" (Am I starting to have a Chengdu accent?) centers on whether the speaker is being perceived as adopting the local linguistic trait—specifically, the Chengdu accent. This implies that the speaker sees accent as a meaningful marker of local identity, and is either reflecting on or being perceived in terms of linguistic-cultural integration.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) is a clear linguistic feature.
- The question format suggests that the speaker acknowledges the importance of accent in being recognized as local.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The speaker implicitly recognizes that speaking with a Chengdu accent is a criterion for being accepted as part of the local group. This reflects a self-awareness of linguistic-cultural recognition as a boundary marker for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author (or speaker) does not explicitly resist or negate the importance of accent; rather, they are questioning whether they are being perceived as having crossed this boundary. This implies implicit endorsement of linguistic-cultural recognition as a standard for local identity.

整个重庆主城区都主要是本地人，重庆不像那些真一线城市那么多移民，最近几年才开始多起来外地口音移居过来的。,RL1,"  
The author emphasizes that the main urban area of Chongqing is predominantly inhabited by ""local people,"" distinguishing it from ""true first-tier cities"" that have long had large immigrant populations. They also note that only in recent years have there been more people with non-local accents moving in. This implies a contrast between historically rooted local populations and more recent outsiders, with a clear sense of who counts as ""local"" based on long-standing demographic patterns.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Mainly local people"" indicates a definition of local identity based on long-term demographic composition.  
- ""Unlike those true first-tier cities with many immigrants"" contrasts Chongqing with cities that have more diverse, immigrant-heavy populations.  
- ""Only recently have more people with外地口音 (non-local accents) moved in"" implies that the arrival of outsiders is a new phenomenon and that the area was previously more homogeneous.  

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is constructing a narrative of Chongqing’s urban core as still largely ""local"" due to its historically low level of immigration compared to cities like Beijing or Shanghai. This suggests that the author sees the relative lack of immigration and the long-standing presence of the same population group as the basis for defining who is considered ""local.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author endorses the idea that long-term demographic stability and the absence of large-scale immigration are key to defining ""local people"" in Chongqing’s urban core. Although migration history is mentioned, it is not framed in terms of family lineage (RL3) but rather in terms of the broader spatial and historical composition of the population.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, because the author defines the Chongqing urban core as ""mainly local"" based on shared historical settlement patterns and a contrast with cities known for high immigration. The author implicitly accepts a collective, historically sedimented understanding of who belongs and who doesn't, based on long-standing local presence.

Output: RL1"
那挨得近~都是土生土长的~,RL3,"  
The author is emphasizing a sense of closeness and familiarity, likely in the context of a local community. The phrase ""土生土长的"" (born and raised here) clearly conveys that the people being referred to have deep, generational roots in the area, which the author uses to affirm their status as ""locals.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长的"" (born and raised here) is a strong indicator of long-term familial or generational connection to the place.
- ""挨得近"" (close by) may imply geographic proximity, but in this context, it supports the idea of shared local background or rootedness.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses ""土生土长的"" to affirm that these individuals are authentic locals due to their generational ties to the area. This is not just a description of physical proximity but a statement about who qualifies as ""local"" based on rootedness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses generational rootedness/local upbringing as the standard for defining ""local people.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL3, which focuses on family historical rootedness or individual growth history as a basis for defining local identity.

Output: RL3"
你那是老辈子的了！或者是直辖前更新的那批！我解放碑五一路土生土长的都是500103 这个没什么要争论的！都是,"RL1, RL2, RL3","  
The author is emphasizing their authentic local identity by asserting that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) in a historically significant urban core area — specifically ""Jiefangbei Wuyi Road"" — is what truly defines a ""local person."" They dismiss older or post-administrative-adjustment identities as less legitimate, and back up their claim with the hukou (household registration) code ""500103,"" which serves as official proof of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) — indicates long-term family rootedness or personal growth history in the local area.  
- ""解放碑五一路"" (Jiefangbei Wuyi Road) — a historically and symbolically significant urban core area in Chongqing, used as a marker of local identity.  
- ""500103"" — a hukou code, indicating administrative legitimacy and official identification with the local area.  
- Dismissal of ""老辈子的了"" (old generation) and ""直辖前更新的那批"" (those updated before Chongqing became a municipality) — suggests the author does not accept alternative or older definitions of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Each of these elements — rootedness (RL3), habitual spatial authority (RL1), and administrative legitimacy (RL2) — are used by the author to **construct a layered and exclusive definition of ""true local identity""** that combines personal history, symbolic geography, and official status. The author is not merely describing these factors but is **using them to define who counts as a legitimate local** and who does not.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
All three criteria — rootedness, habitual spatial cognition, and administrative belonging — are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as standards for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author identifies with a historically central and symbolically meaningful urban location (""Jiefangbei Wuyi Road"") as the core of local identity, distinguishing it from peripheral or newly incorporated areas.  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The hukou code ""500103"" is invoked as a definitive, official marker of local belonging.  
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The phrase ""土生土长"" affirms the author’s own deep personal and possibly generational connection to the area.

渝中区土著，大坪土生土长，现在住渝北,RL3,"  
The author identifies themselves as a ""土著"" (indigenous/native) of Yuzhong District and grew up in Daping, but currently resides in Yubei. This self-identification highlights a sense of rootedness and origin in a historically significant urban core area, while also acknowledging a current residential shift. The use of ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) emphasizes a personal history deeply tied to a specific place, which the author implicitly values in defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/native) implies long-standing local belonging.
- ""大坪土生土长"" (born and raised in Daping) clearly emphasizes family and individual rootedness in the area.
- ""现在住渝北"" (now living in Yubei) contrasts current residence with original roots, suggesting that origin, not current location, is central to the author's sense of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's emphasis is on personal rootedness and generational continuity in a historically central urban area (Yuzhong/Daping), which they seem to view as the authentic basis of being a ""local person."" The current move to Yubei does not negate this foundational identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses family rootedness and individual growth history in a historically significant local area as the standard for defining ""local identity.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with RL3, which defines ""local identity"" based on family historical rootedness or individual growth history in a place.

The author is expressing a sense of confusion or absence—wondering if there are any ""native"" people from Dazukou left. They then share their own family background, noting that although their parents grew up in areas now part of Dazukou (城头, 大溪沟, 枣子岚垭, 和平路), those areas were administratively under different jurisdictions at the time. The author was born in what was then Jiulongpo District (身份证编码 510203), and the area was later reclassified as part of Dazukou. This suggests that due to administrative changes, it's hard to identify people who are ""genuinely rooted"" in Dazukou.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""大渡口的土著"" (natives of Dazukou): Implies a concern with who qualifies as a true local.
- Parents' childhood locations (大溪沟, 枣子岚垭, 和平路): Suggests historical rootedness in what is now Dazukou.
- ""510203"": ID number indicating hukou registration at birth, pointing to administrative belonging.
- Mention of administrative boundary change: The area where the author was born was originally part of Jiulongpo but later became part of Dazukou.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is grappling with the definition of ""local people"" in the context of administrative boundary changes. They suggest that due to these changes, even people with deep historical roots may not neatly fit into current administrative identities. The author's own identity is shaped by both family rootedness and administrative classification, but the two are in tension.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses both **family historical rootedness** and **administrative legitimacy** as relevant standards for defining local identity. They reflect on how administrative changes complicate the definition of ""local people"" for Dazukou, while also emphasizing that their family has long-standing ties to the area.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author references their ID number (510203) and discusses administrative boundary changes, showing that they consider administrative classification as a key factor in defining local identity.
- **RL3 (Family Rootedness):** The author emphasizes that their parents grew up in now-Dazukou areas, indicating that family history is also an important standard in their understanding of local identity.

渝中区 虽然老，但是配套齐全 医疗 教育 交通,RL5,"  
The author is positively evaluating **Yuzhong District**, acknowledging that although it is old, it has comprehensive amenities including medical care, education, and transportation. This reflects a preference for areas with high functional livability and environmental quality as ideal local living spaces.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""虽然老，但是配套齐全"" (Although old, the facilities are complete) – reflects evaluation based on functional livability.  
- ""医疗、教育、交通"" (Medical, education, transportation) – specific components of urban infrastructure and convenience.  
- Implicitly, the author sees these as important qualities that make Yuzhong District a desirable or ""legitimate"" local area despite its age.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the presence of essential urban infrastructure and services to affirm the district’s value as a desirable local area. This implies that such functional and environmental qualities are standards used to evaluate or define what constitutes a ""genuine"" or ""desirable"" local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses and links the presence of amenities and infrastructure (functional livability) to the desirability and legitimacy of the area as a ""local"" space.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability**, as the author evaluates the area based on its infrastructure and environmental quality and implies that these factors make it a legitimate or superior local area.

像我这种化龙桥曾经贫困一条街的拆迁户搬到沙坪坝了，都搬了20年了。我的童年和学生时代都在化龙桥呀,RL3,"  
The author is reflecting on their personal history, emphasizing that although they have moved away from **Chuanlongqiao** (化龙桥) for 20 years, their **formative years — childhood and student days — were spent there**. This suggests a deep emotional and identity connection to the area based on **long-term personal growth history**, rather than current residence.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- ""我这种...拆迁户"" (people like me who were relocated due to demolition) implies a history tied to a specific place.
- ""都搬了20年了"" (already moved for 20 years) indicates a long time away from the original location.
- ""我的童年和学生时代都在化龙桥呀"" (my childhood and student years were all in Chuanlongqiao) emphasizes **personal rootedness through early life experiences**, which the author still identifies with.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:
The author is asserting that their **identity is still shaped by where they grew up**, not where they currently live. This implies that **long-term personal history and upbringing in a place are central to defining one's ""local"" identity**, even after physical relocation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:
The author **clearly endorses** the idea that **growing up in a place (Chuanlongqiao)** is a valid basis for claiming local identity, even after relocation. This aligns with the RL3 definition of **Family Rootedness**, which includes **individual growth history in immigrant city contexts** as a basis for local identity.

The author provides a detailed life trajectory across multiple districts in Chongqing, listing where they were born and lived during different life stages (e.g.,渝中/Yuzhong for birth and childhood, 南岸/Nanan for middle school, 沙区/Shaping for high school due to schooling, 大学/college in Jiangbei, and currently in 两江新区/Liangjiang New Area). They conclude by explicitly stating that they believe 两江新区 is the most suitable for living due to its amenities (e.g., ""公园多/parks are plentiful""). This reflects a preference for certain areas based on livability and environmental quality.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of multiple districts lived in across different life stages (birth, kindergarten, primary school, middle school, high school, university, current residence) indicates mobility and exposure to various areas.  
- ""我觉得两江新区最适宜居住，公园多"" (""I think Liangjiang New Area is most suitable for living, with many parks"") reflects an evaluation of the area based on environmental and functional livability features.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their personal experience of living across various districts to ultimately conclude that Liangjiang New Area is the most suitable for living. The criteria they use include the presence of parks and presumably other livability features, indicating that they judge the ""local"" value of an area through its functional and environmental qualities.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the idea that Liangjiang New Area is the most suitable for living because of its environmental quality and amenities (e.g., parks), indicating that they use these as criteria for evaluating ""local"" living spaces.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author uses livability and environmental quality (e.g., parks, presumably good infrastructure) as criteria to evaluate and define what constitutes a desirable or ""suitable"" local living area.

The author expresses a strong emotional attachment to the place where they were born (""大坪医院"") and have continuously lived (""一直住谢家湾这边""). They explicitly resist their mother's idea of moving, indicating that their sense of local identity is deeply rooted in personal growth history and long-term residence in the area.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""出生在大坪医院"" (born at Daping Hospital) indicates the origin of their local connection.  
- ""一直住谢家湾这边"" (have always lived in the Xiejiawan area) shows long-term residence and spatial continuity.  
- ""不愿意离开"" (not willing to leave) reflects emotional attachment and identity rooted in place of growth.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's resistance to moving is grounded in their personal history of being born and raised in the area. This implies that long-term residence and emotional attachment to the place of birth and upbringing are central to their sense of ""local"" identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being born and raised in a place forms the basis of local identity. This is not just a preference or description of their life history—it is the core reason they feel a sense of belonging and resist relocation.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL3: Family Rootedness**, as the author's local identity is based on being born and raised in the area, reflecting a deep personal and emotional connection formed through long-term residence and growth history.

不是，土著是🈯只有解放碑为商业中心的那个时代就住在两江三岸的人,RL1,"  
The author is defining who qualifies as a ""native"" (土著) by emphasizing that it refers only to those who lived in the ""two rivers and three banks"" (两江三岸) area during the era when Jiefangbei (解放碑) was the sole commercial center. This is a clear boundary drawn by the author for what counts as ""local"" or ""native"" identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Only... that era"" indicates a historical-temporal marker.
- ""Lived in two rivers and three banks"" refers to a specific geographical area.
- The definition is based on long-standing spatial belonging and historical continuity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses a historically rooted spatial understanding—residing in a core area during a defining era of the city’s development—as the standard for determining who is a ""true native."" This is not about administrative boundaries or family history, but about being part of the city’s original core spatial identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a historically sedimented and socially habitual understanding of which area counts as the authentic core, and who therefore qualifies as ""local"" or ""native."" This aligns with a socially shared perception of space tied to identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text reflects a definition of local identity based on socially habitual and historically rooted spatial cognition, which aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.

口音是重庆城头口音，不能有区县口音,RL4,"  
The author emphasizes that only a specific urban accent—**the authentic Chongqing city accent**—is considered truly representative of a local, and explicitly excludes **district or county-level accents** from being seen as authentic. This shows that the author uses **linguistic features (specifically accent)** as a boundary marker to define who counts as a ""real local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""口音是重庆城头口音"" (accent is the authentic Chongqing city accent) – linguistic-cultural recognition.
- ""不能有区县口音"" (cannot have district or county accents) – exclusion based on non-core local accents.
- The focus is clearly on **accent as a cultural identifier** for local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a distinction between **core urban linguistic identity** and **peripheral (district/county) linguistic identity**, using accent as a key standard to determine who is considered a ""true local."" This reflects **linguistic-cultural recognition** as a symbolic boundary for local belonging.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses **accent**—specifically the urban Chongqing accent—as the standard for defining ""true local"" identity, and **explicitly excludes** those with district-level accents from this category.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition**, where **accent or dialect** is used as a key marker to distinguish insiders (true locals) from outsiders or less authentic locals.

The author is describing a residential migration history—moving from the lower part of the city to Longxi Town (""镇头""), but still maintaining a family connection to the old house on Shibati Hill, where their father continues to live. The phrase **""他们土生土长在那里住惯了""** (""they were born and raised there and are used to living there"") emphasizes a deep-rooted, generational connection to the old neighborhood.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- **""土生土长""** (born and raised here) — a clear indicator of long-term familial or generational rootedness.  
- **""老房子""** (old house), **""住惯了""** (used to living there) — imply emotional and historical attachment to place.  
- The author contrasts their current residence with the long-term rootedness of others in the original location.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The key idea is that **some people have a generational, rooted connection to the old city area (Shibati Hill), while the author themselves have moved**. This distinction is used to define who is truly ""local"" — those who were born, raised, and remained in the original location.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:

The author is reflecting on how their father moved from Yuzhong District to Jiulongpo District 50 years ago due to work, and because he had a house there, the **hukou (household registration)** was also transferred. The author expresses regret over not ""staying put"" in Yuzhong District, suggesting that they believe remaining in a core area (Yuzhong) would have had greater value or legitimacy over time.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Because of work"" — indicates mobility not based on local identity but employment.
- ""Because there was a house"" — property ownership plays a role in the move.
- ""Hukou was transferred"" — administrative legitimacy/belonging changed.
- ""Early on, there was no concept of housing prices being more valuable"" — suggests housing value and location have since become more meaningful.
- ""Wish I had stayed in Yuzhong District"" — indicates a belief that remaining in a historically central or ""core"" district would have preserved or enhanced local identity or value.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that **administrative hukou transfer and property ownership** were key in changing their family’s local status, but they now believe **staying in the original core area (Yuzhong)** would have been better. This reflects a belief that **administrative belonging and rootedness in a historically recognized central area** are important for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **staying in the original core district (Yuzhong)** is a better marker of local identity or value.
- The **hukou transfer** is presented as a factual mechanism of changing administrative belonging, and the author **does not explicitly reject** this as a standard, but rather laments its consequences.
- **Property ownership** is a key reason for the hukou change, showing how **material and administrative factors are intertwined** in defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The author expresses a belief that **Yuzhong District is a core area** with symbolic value, and that **""staying"" there would have preserved a more authentic local identity** — this aligns with the idea of **habitual or historically sedimented perceptions of spatial identity**.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author mentions the **hukou transfer** as a key event that changed their family's local status, showing **endorsement of administrative belonging** as a factor in defining local identity.
- **RL6 (Social Embeddedness):** Property ownership is **explicitly mentioned as the reason for the hukou transfer**, and the author reflects on how this changed their family’s rootedness and social positioning — this aligns with **property and embeddedness as markers of local status**.

The author is commenting on the demographic makeup of the city center, noting that few people are ""native"" or ""born and raised"" there (""土生土长的很少""). They explain this by referencing historical conditions (""以前就没多少人"", ""没高楼"") and point out that many residents are ""外来"" (migrants or newcomers). This reflects a belief that being ""born and raised"" in a place is a key standard for defining who is truly a ""local.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) — directly references generational rootedness.
- ""以前就没多少人"", ""看以前的老照片就知道"" — historical settlement patterns.
- ""外来的比较多"" — contrast between locals and outsiders based on birthplace and migration.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author implies that ""being born and raised in the city center"" is a meaningful and rare status, which serves as a standard for defining ""true locals."" The mention of historical settlement patterns supports this logic by explaining why such people are few. The contrast with ""外来"" further reinforces this as a boundary for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses the idea that being ""born and raised"" in a place (especially the city center) is a significant criterion for defining ""local people.""

同意！下楼就是地铁安逸惨,N/A,"  
The author expresses satisfaction with the convenience of having a subway station right downstairs, indicating that this feature significantly enhances the desirability or comfort of the living environment. However, the statement is brief and does not explicitly or strongly imply that this convenience is being used as a **standard to define who is local** or what counts as a **""local"" area** in terms of identity.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""下楼就是地铁"" (subway right downstairs) indicates functional livability and convenience.
- ""安逸惨"" (extremely comfortable/pleasant) is an evaluative expression about the quality of life.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
While the author clearly appreciates the convenience of the subway and the resulting comfort of the area, there is **no explicit or implicit statement** that this feature is being used to **define local identity** or to **draw boundaries around who counts as local**. The comment focuses on **personal preference or quality of life**, not on identity standards.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the text reflects a positive evaluation of functional livability (RL5), it **does not go beyond preference** to define or judge ""local identity"" or ""local area"" based on this feature.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Since the author does not link the functional livability (subway access) to a **standard for defining local identity**, the text does **not meet the threshold** for RL5 or any other RL category.

  - ""从心里认可这个城市就必须移植到大脑的文化里"" — implies that cultural integration is key to local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
Each RL element contributes to the author’s **integrated logic of local identity**:
- **RL1** sets the **emotional/spatial boundary** of what is considered truly ""local.""
- **RL5** reinforces this by **functionally validating** the superiority of old Changsha in terms of infrastructure and convenience.
- **RL4** provides the **cultural legitimacy** and emotional depth that makes the local identity feel authentic and enduring.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
All three RL elements are **explicitly endorsed** and used by the author to define what constitutes a ""true"" local area and identity. The author does not just describe these factors—they **use them to argue for a specific standard of ""local"" belonging**.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1** is used to define the **emotional and habitual boundaries** of local identity.  
- **RL4** is used to define the **cultural authenticity** and emotional connection to the city.  
- **RL5** is used to define the **practical and infrastructural superiority** of certain areas, which contributes to the author’s sense of where ""real"" locals live and why those areas are more desirable.

我只是发表个人感受，我住了3年梅溪湖，然后我老公就吐槽了三年，然后在房价没跌的时候果断卖掉了,N/A,"  
The author is sharing a personal anecdote about living in Meixihu (Plum Creek Lake) for three years, during which her husband consistently complained. She then made the decision to sell the property before prices dropped. The focus is on personal dissatisfaction and property value concerns, not on defining ""local identity.""

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""I lived in Meixihu for 3 years"" – mentions a location, but not necessarily used to define local identity.  
- ""My husband complained for three years"" – expresses dissatisfaction with the area, but not a standard for defining locals.  
- ""Sold it before the price dropped"" – focuses on property value and timing, not on local belonging or identity criteria.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
There is no indication that the author is using any of these points to define who is or is not a ""local person."" The narrative is about personal experience and property investment, not about constructing or endorsing criteria for local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
None of the RL categories apply, as the author does not propose or imply any standard for defining ""local identity."" The discussion centers on personal preference, property value, and domestic life, not on who counts as ""local.""

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
No RL category is applicable because the text does not define or evaluate ""local identity"" using any of the seven RL criteria.

所以我喜欢北辰，老城区往新区的过渡，街道界面没老城区那么破旧，离市中心又只需要十几分钟，配套啥都有，住起来太舒服哒,RL5,"  
The author expresses a clear preference for the Beichen area, emphasizing its comfortable living conditions. They highlight its position as a transitional zone between the old city and new district, its less dilapidated appearance compared to the old city, its convenient proximity to the city center, and its comprehensive配套设施 (amenities). These points collectively indicate that the author values functional livability and environmental quality when evaluating what makes a place a desirable ""local"" area to live.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老城区往新区的过渡"" (transition from the old city to the new district) – suggests spatial positioning but not directly about identity definition.  
- ""街道界面没老城区那么破旧"" (the streetscape isn't as dilapidated as the old city's) – reflects environmental quality.  
- ""离市中心又只需要十几分钟"" (only a dozen minutes from the city center) – implies transportation convenience.  
- ""配套啥都有"" (has all the amenities) – functional infrastructure and convenience.  
- ""住起来太舒服哒"" (so comfortable to live there) – overall evaluation of livability and comfort.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
All the mentioned features are used by the author to evaluate and justify why Beichen is a desirable and comfortable place to live. The author implicitly frames these features as markers of a high-quality ""local"" living environment, distinguishing it from less desirable or older parts of the city. This implies that the author uses livability and environmental quality as criteria for judging what constitutes a desirable or authentic local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses and emphasizes the **functional livability** and **environmental quality** of Beichen as the basis for their positive evaluation and preference. This goes beyond mere personal taste—it reflects a standard of what the author considers a ""good"" or ""comfortable"" local living space, which in turn informs their implicit definition of desirable ""local"" areas.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This text aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability (生活功能便利性与环境品质认知)**, as the author uses descriptions of convenience, infrastructure, and environmental quality to define what makes a place a desirable or ""true"" local residential area.

The author is reflecting on their personal growth trajectory, contrasting their upbringing in the old urban area (""南门口"", ""八角亭"") with their current residence in Meixihu. They emphasize that growing up in the old city (""正宗老城区长大的"") shaped their sense of local identity, as evidenced by strong neighborhood familiarity and warm interpersonal relationships. At the same time, they express appreciation for the functional livability of Meixihu (e.g., convenient schooling, vibrant community, lakeside strolls), but still prefer the old city for social and lifestyle purposes.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，正宗老城区长大的"" — emphasizes growing up in the old city, a clear indicator of family rootedness and long-term local exposure.  
- ""老城区就是邻居都会比较熟络...邻居都会很热情的喊你"" — highlights social embeddedness and neighborhood familiarity, suggesting deep social roots.  
- ""现在住梅溪湖...小区比较有活力，小孩上学方便，晚上湖边散步也很方便"" — describes functional livability of the current residence.  
- ""朋友聚会逛街还是喜欢去‘城里’"" — implies a preference for the old urban core, potentially linking to vernacular spatial cognition.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author's upbringing in the old city is presented as a form of ""authentic"" local identity formation (RL3). The warm, familiar social environment of the old city (RL6) is contrasted with the modern, functional advantages of Meixihu (RL5). The author still emotionally and socially identifies with the old city (""城里""), which may reflect a vernacular spatial hierarchy (RL1). However, the author does not explicitly use administrative boundaries or linguistic markers to define localness.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **explicitly endorses** growing up in the old city as a basis for authentic local identity (RL3).  
- The author **implicitly endorses** the social familiarity and neighborhood warmth of the old city as a standard for local rootedness (RL6).  
- The author **also endorses** functional livability and environmental quality (e.g., school access, lakeside amenities) as positive attributes, though they do not equate this with being ""more local"" than the old city, but rather as a comfortable living environment (RL5).  
- The author **implies a vernacular spatial distinction** between ""城里"" and other areas, but does not use this to define ""local people"" in a strict boundary-marking sense (RL1 is borderline, but not strongly endorsed).

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text clearly reflects **RL3 (Family Rootedness)** due to the emphasis on being ""born and raised in the old city"" as the foundation of local identity.  
It also reflects **RL5 (Functional Livability)** through the author's appreciation of Meixihu's amenities and livability, though this does not override their emotional tie to the old city.  
Additionally, **RL6 (Social Embeddedness)** is present, as the author values the deep neighborhood ties and familiarity of the old city, which they contrast with their current living situation.

The author reflects on their subjective perception of spatial scale and distance in长沙 (Changsha), shaped by early life experiences and comparisons with other cities like Wuhan. They describe how their sense of what feels ""close"" or ""far"" is rooted in personal history and local familiarity, contrasting with people from larger cities who might perceive Changsha as small. The author also emphasizes the value of walkability and proximity to daily destinations (""my附近 is reachable on foot"") as a defining feature of their local experience.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""根植于心中远近的标准"" (subjective, deeply rooted perception of near/far) → points to habitual, emotional spatial cognition.  
- ""最远的距离是从侯家塘到步行街"" (the farthest distance was from Houjiatang to the pedestrian street) → reflects a historically bounded local spatial understanding.  
- ""河西"" (West Bank), ""侯家塘"", ""步行街"" (pedestrian street) → specific local place names used to anchor a localized sense of space.  
- ""离家太远了"" (too far from home), ""我的附近是能双脚到达"" (my nearby is reachable on foot) → emphasizes a personal, lived-in local space defined by proximity and walkability.  
- Mention of Wuhan relatives misunderstanding the scale → highlights how different cities develop different emotional/spatial maps.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not talking about administrative boundaries, economic status, or even functional distance (e.g., travel time), but rather a **deeply internalized, habitual understanding of space** shaped by growing up in Changsha. This emotional map defines what feels ""local"" to them — not just where they live, but what they can easily access and how far they can mentally imagine going without feeling ""away from home.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses a **subjective, habitual, and emotionally rooted understanding of space** as the standard for defining what feels ""local"" or ""nearby."" They contrast this with outsiders' perceptions and emphasize the symbolic meaning of spatial proximity in local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, which refers to shared, habitual, or historically sedimented local perceptions of spatial categories — not based on official boundaries but on emotional and cultural maps used to define ""local"" identity.

哈哈哈，二环的乡里别给你点赞,RL1,"  
The phrase ""二环的乡里别给你点赞"" (literally: ""Don't expect a like from the villagers in the Second Ring"") uses irony or humor to highlight a perceived identity or status boundary. It implies that people from certain areas (referred to as ""villagers"" or ""乡里"") are not part of the same social or spatial ""local"" group as the speaker. The use of ""Second Ring"" also indicates a specific spatial认知 (area perception) being used to define or mock a boundary of local belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""二环"" (Second Ring Road): a spatial boundary marker that reflects a habitual or symbolic understanding of urban space.  
- ""乡里"" (villagers): a term that may carry connotations of rural background or perceived lower status, possibly linked to occupational or cultural identity.  
- The phrase carries an implicit boundary between ""us"" and ""them"" in terms of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses the spatial boundary of the ""Second Ring"" to symbolically demarcate who is considered part of the ""true local"" group and who is not. The use of ""乡里"" adds a layer of cultural or class-based distinction, but the core mechanism of exclusion is rooted in a habitual spatial认知 that assigns different symbolic meanings to areas inside or outside this boundary.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a habitual or symbolic spatial认知 — that people from certain ring-road areas are not part of the ""real local"" group — as a standard for defining local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses a commonly understood but unofficial spatial boundary (Second Ring Road) to imply a distinction in local identity, reflecting a shared or habitual perception of who belongs where.

小时候在五一广场出生长大的，结婚之后住在梅溪湖，爸妈说我是到乡里去了说鸟不拉屎的地方,RL1,"  
The author shares a personal narrative of growing up in a central, familiar area (Wuyi Square), and later moving to a new residential area (Meixihu), which their parents refer to as a remote or undesirable place — using the phrase “bird wouldn’t even shit there” (鸟不拉屎的地方). This reflects a generational difference in spatial perception and the emotional or symbolic meaning attached to certain areas.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- “Wuyi Square” is described as the place of birth and upbringing, implying emotional attachment and symbolic rootedness.  
- “Meixihu” is described as a new residential area that is spatially and symbolically distant from the original.  
- The parents’ judgment of Meixihu as “the countryside” (乡里) and “a place where even birds won’t shit” reflects a **habitual, culturally shared perception** of spatial hierarchy — that some places are not truly part of the “local” urban core.  
- The phrase “to the countryside” (到乡里去) implies a symbolic boundary between urban and suburban/rural, used to evaluate belonging and local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not just describing their life change, but highlighting how **certain areas are symbolically and emotionally categorized** in local discourse — with Wuyi Square as the authentic, core local space, and Meixihu as peripheral or even “non-local” in a symbolic sense. The parents’ judgment reflects a **socially sedimented, habitual spatial认知** that defines what “counts” as local.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
Although the author does not explicitly endorse the parents’ view, they **do not reject it either**, and they frame the narrative in a way that centers on **how place of upbringing and symbolic spatial categorization influence local identity**. The text reflects the author’s **implicit acceptance** of the logic that certain areas are seen as the “real” or “core” local spaces, while others are not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the text reflects **shared, habitual, and symbolic perceptions of urban space** that are used to define who is “truly local” — based on upbringing in a core area and the symbolic status of that area within local cognition.

The author is challenging the definition and symbolic value of ""老城区"" (old urban area). They question whether侯家塘 (Houjiatang) qualifies as part of the old city, and point out that areas like天剑路 (Tianjian Road) may not be comfortable to live in. They also mock the supposed superiority of the old city by questioning the claim that it's not congested, implying that this perceived superiority is unfounded.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""老城区"" (old urban area): a socially recognized spatial category with symbolic meaning.  
- Mention of specific locations (侯家塘, 天剑路): used to critique the assumed quality or comfort of certain urban areas.  
- ""老城区不堵车"" (old city isn't congested): challenges a perceived advantage of the old city.  
- ""优越感"" (superiority): implies a symbolic hierarchy associated with certain areas.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is **critiquing** the idea that certain areas (e.g., the so-called ""old city"") hold symbolic superiority or better quality of life. They imply that the label ""老城区"" does not necessarily equate with comfort or desirability. This reflects an **implicit rejection** of traditional **spatial symbolic value** or **habitual spatial cognition** associated with the old city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author **does not endorse** the idea that being in the old city makes someone or some place more ""local"" or superior. Instead, they **challenge** that notion. Therefore, **no RL category should be annotated**, because the author **does not endorse** any standard for defining ""local people"" or ""local area"" based on spatial symbolism or other RL criteria.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
Although the text discusses spatial perception and mentions specific urban areas, the author is **not endorsing** any criteria for defining ""local identity."" They are **questioning and resisting** the symbolic legitimacy of the ""old city"" as a marker of local superiority.

哪有那么多原因，就是习惯了啊，家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在。另外，南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路。,"RL1, RL6","  
The author emphasizes that their sense of local identity is rooted in long-term habitation and social embeddedness — ""it's just a habit,"" ""family is here,"" ""friends are here,"" ""work is here."" These are all markers of deep-rooted social integration and habitual spatial identification. The author also implicitly defines their spatial scope of local identification by stating that going as far as the ""South Second Ring"" is unthinkable, with ""Laodong Road"" being the outer limit.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Habit"" (习惯了) implies a deep, internalized sense of belonging rooted in long-term spatial and social continuity.  
- ""Family, friends, and work are all here"" reflects strong social embeddedness and local social networks.  
- ""South Second Ring is impossible"" and ""Laodong Road is the limit"" show habitual spatial cognition and boundaries of local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses both **habitual spatial cognition** (RL1) and **social embeddedness** (RL6) as foundational elements of their local identity. The statement ""it's just a habit"" reflects a sedimented, shared understanding of spatial boundaries, while the presence of family, friends, and work underscores the depth of social integration that defines ""localness.""

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses both the habitual spatial boundary (RL1) and the presence of deep social ties (RL6) as central to their sense of local identity.

They further clarify the administrative structure, noting that **Yuelu District’s Party Committee and Government work together** with the **Xiangjiang New Area’s leadership**, implying a merged governance model. This highlights the importance of **administrative legitimacy and jurisdictional clarity** in defining local identity or belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""Functional zone"" vs. ""administrative district"" — distinguishes between functional and administrative status.
- ""Yuelu District Party Committee and Government"" and ""Xiangjiang New Area Party Working Committee and Management Committee"" — reference to administrative and political structures.
- The emphasis on **governance structure and administrative boundaries** suggests a concern with **official legitimacy** in defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is asserting that **true local identity or administrative belonging** should be understood through **official jurisdictional structures**, not through functional or developmental zones. This implies that **administrative legitimacy is the standard** for defining who or what belongs to the local area.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly endorses **administrative boundaries and official governance structures** as the basis for defining local identity and distinguishing functional zones from true administrative districts.

The author is emphasizing the distinction between formal administrative legitimacy and special economic development zones. They are questioning the administrative status of湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New Area), pointing out that although it may function as a special economic zone, it does not have the same administrative or legal status as岳麓区 (Yuelu District), as evidenced by the presence of official institutions like the Yuelu District People's Court and Yuelu District Government. The author is asserting that true ""local"" identity should be defined based on official administrative divisions.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mention of岳麓区人民法院 (Yuelu District People's Court), 岳麓区zf (Yuelu District Government) – these are indicators of formal administrative institutions.  
- Mention of地图上是显示岳麓区还是湘江新区 (whether the map shows Yuelu District or Xiangjiang New Area) – this reflects a concern with official spatial categorization.  
- Emphasis on湘江新区只是经济发展上的特殊区划，又不是行政区划 (Xiangjiang New Area is only a special economic zone, not an administrative one) – this clearly distinguishes between economic function and administrative legitimacy.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is making a clear distinction between economic-functional zones and true administrative zones. They are advocating that ""local identity"" should be determined by formal administrative affiliation (e.g., being part of岳麓区 with full administrative institutions), rather than by economic zoning (湘江新区), which lacks full administrative status. This reflects an endorsement of administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining local identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author explicitly endorses the use of administrative boundaries and institutional presence (e.g., courts, governments) as the standard for defining ""local people"" or local area identity.

They point out that Xiangjiang New District is not an administrative entity but a functional zone that includes parts of Yuelu District and Wangcheng District. This reflects an emphasis on **administrative legitimacy** as the basis for defining local identity or belonging.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""湘江新区只是个功能区"" (""Xiangjiang New District is just a functional zone"")  
- ""行政区还是叫岳麓区"" (""the administrative district is still called Yuelu District"")  
- Reference to administrative composition: ""相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方"" (""equivalent to Yuelu plus some parts of Wangcheng"")  

These phrases all focus on the **administrative boundaries and legitimacy** as the standard for defining local identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is emphasizing that **only official administrative divisions** (like Yuelu District) should be used to define local identity, not functional or developmental zones like Xiangjiang New District. This reflects a clear endorsement of **administrative legitimacy** as the core standard for defining what counts as ""local.""

The author is expressing a **hierarchical perception of urban space** based on **socially conventional understandings of what counts as “urban” or “local core”**. They describe how only certain areas (like **Tianxin District**, especially **Puzi Street**) are considered “true urban” or “core local” areas, while others (e.g., **Yuhua District**, **Kaifu District**, and especially **Yuelu District**, **Tiaoma**, **Wangcheng**) are seen as rural or peripheral. This reflects a **shared or habitual spatial cognition** that goes beyond administrative boundaries.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- Mentions of specific districts and sub-districts (Tianxin, Puzi Street, Yuhua, Kaifu, Yuelu, Tiaoma, Wangcheng) indicate **spatial categorization**.
- Phrases like “范围大点只有天心区算城区” (only Tianxin District counts as urban if you widen the scope), “老城区只有坡子街那一块小破地” (the old city is just that tiny run-down area of Puzi Street), and “荒郊野地” (desolate outskirts) reflect **symbolic meanings and social perceptions of space**.
- The author’s husband is described as “土生土长的坡子街人” (born and raised in Puzi Street), which might suggest family rootedness, but the key point being emphasized is **where** they are from — not how long they’ve lived there.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not primarily emphasizing **administrative boundaries** (RL2), **family history** (RL3), **language** (RL4), **livability** (RL5), **social/economic status** (RL6), or **occupation** (RL7). Instead, the argument is built on **habitual or socially accepted understandings of which areas are “real” city areas** and which are not — a **cognitive-emotional map** of the city.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author clearly **endorses and reproduces** a **shared spatial认知** — a **socially sedimented perception** that only certain areas are considered “urban” or “local,” and others are not. This is a **symbolic boundary** used to define **who and where counts as “local.”**

小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，然后去了捞刀河，接着又住到暮云，最后住到了梅溪湖，变成了xlb 哈哈哈哈哈哈,RL3,"  
The author humorously outlines their personal residential trajectory across different areas in Changsha (南门口 → 八角亭 → 捞刀河 → 暮云 → 梅溪湖), ending with the phrase ""变成了xlb"" (became an xlber), which is a local internet slang often used to mock or ironically label people who have moved to the upscale 梅溪湖 (Meixihu) area. This implies that moving to certain areas can change how one is perceived or labeled in terms of local identity, especially in a humorous or ironic way.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- The author lists multiple locations, showing a pattern of movement across different neighborhoods.
- The final move to 梅溪湖 (Meixihu), a newly developed upscale area, is linked with a shift in identity label (""变成了xlb"").
- The tone is humorous and self-aware, but it also reflects an implicit understanding that where you live can influence how others perceive your ""local"" identity.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author uses their own life history (residential mobility across different areas) and the associated identity label change to reflect a broader social perception: that **residential location**—especially in newly developed or socially distinct areas—can influence how someone is seen in terms of local identity. Although the author is joking, they are not rejecting the idea that place of residence affects identity perception; rather, they are acknowledging it.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author does not explicitly endorse a specific standard, but the text implies that **residential history and current location** influence local identity perception.
- This aligns with **RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** because it involves how a person's long-term growth and movement history within the city affects their local identity.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
The text humorously reflects how a person's residential trajectory and final location can shape their perceived local identity, implying that where you've lived matters for how you're seen in local identity terms. This reflects the RL3 logic of individual growth history within a city as a marker of local belonging.

哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,RL7,"  
The phrase ""哈是乡里别，哪有城里人"" (roughly: ""How can they be country folks, not urban people"") reflects a distinction between rural and urban identities. The author implies that certain people, likely due to their background or characteristics, are not considered ""true city people."" Though the statement is brief, it conveys a symbolic boundary based on perceived social or occupational background.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""乡里别"" (country/rural people) vs. ""城里人"" (urban/city people) — this is a clear identity contrast.
- The contrast implies that being a ""true city person"" is not just about location or legal status but also about social or occupational type.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is drawing a symbolic boundary between rural and urban identities. The phrase suggests that certain people are excluded from the category of ""city people"" due to traits associated with their background, which may include occupation, lifestyle, or cultural perception.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses a distinction based on social or occupational type — treating rural background as disqualifying for being considered a ""true"" city person.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL7: Occupational Typification**, as it uses a symbolic distinction often tied to occupation (rural vs. urban livelihoods) to define who counts as a ""real"" local or city person, invoking implicit social hierarchies.

我在五一广场 有个同事不知道我们经理就是那个月亮岛那里的，然后他就说乡里别 然后我们经理就说那里已经属于是开发区了，不属于是乡里了，然后我同事还没理解意思，一直在吐槽那里不好不好，结果我们经理就背后面针对他，懂得都懂,"RL1, RL2","  
The author recounts an interaction where a colleague unknowingly insulted the manager by referring to his place of origin using a stigmatized label (""乡里别"" – roughly, ""country bumpkin""), likely due to perceiving the area as rural or non-urban. The manager corrected the colleague by stating that the area (Moon Island) is now officially part of the **Development Zone**, implying it should no longer be considered rural. The colleague continued to criticize the area, leading the manager to retaliate. The author ends with a subtle but clear acknowledgment (""懂得都懂"") indicating that the colleague's lack of understanding of the area’s new status had consequences.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:
- **""月亮岛"" (Moon Island)** and **""开发区"" (Development Zone)**: These refer to specific geographical areas and their changing administrative or symbolic status.
- **""乡里别"" (rural outsider)**: A derogatory term used to mock someone from a non-urban area, indicating a cultural or symbolic boundary.
- **""已经属于开发区了"" (now belongs to the Development Zone)**: A correction based on **administrative legitimacy**, asserting that the area should no longer be seen as rural.
- The colleague's criticism of the area and the manager's subsequent retaliation imply that **perceptions of place** (and the ability to correctly interpret its status) are socially and symbolically significant.
- The ending phrase **""懂得都懂""** suggests shared understanding of the unspoken social logic: that **administrative status and spatial perception** are important in defining who belongs and who doesn't.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The core of the author’s narrative is the **tension between old spatial perceptions and new administrative designations**, and how this affects social treatment and identity legitimacy. The manager asserts **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) to redefine the area’s status, while the colleague's use of a rural slur reflects **vernacular spatial authority** (RL1) — outdated or socially habitual perceptions. The author implies that **understanding and recognizing the new administrative boundary is part of being socially competent**, and failing to do so can result in exclusion or retaliation.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
- The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **administrative designation** (RL2) should override **habitual rural labeling** (RL1) in defining what is ""local"" or acceptable in an urban context.
- The narrative also **highlights the continued influence of old spatial perceptions** (RL1), even as they are being challenged by new administrative realities (RL2), suggesting that both are **functionally relevant** in how people are judged as ""local"" or not.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
- **RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):** The colleague’s use of ""乡里别"" reflects socially habitual rural labeling, and the author presents this as a real but outdated or incorrect way of thinking.
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The manager’s correction that the area ""belongs to the Development Zone"" and the author’s tacit support of that correction show endorsement of administrative boundaries as a legitimate standard for defining local identity.

住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,RL1,"  
The sentence ""住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人"" (Those living on Beizheng Street count as urbanites among rural folks) implies a layered identity categorization. While the broader area may be considered rural (""乡里别""), the specific location — Beizheng Street — carries a symbolic status that distinguishes its residents as more ""urban"" or ""local core"" within that rural context. This reflects a habitual or socially accepted spatial hierarchy within the local identity framework.

2. Identify All Potential RL Elements:  
- ""北正街"" (Beizheng Street) is a specific local area that is symbolically elevated.
- ""城里人"" (urbanites) implies a higher status identity marker compared to the surrounding ""rural"" context.
- The phrase suggests a socially recognized distinction between different parts of the same broader region.

3. Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument:  
The author is not simply describing a location or a lifestyle — they are affirming a symbolic spatial hierarchy. Beizheng Street is implicitly recognized as carrying more ""local urban"" value within a predominantly rural area, reflecting a habitual or socially accepted perception of spatial identity.

4. Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author:  
The author implicitly endorses the idea that certain areas (like Beizheng Street) carry symbolic urban identity within a broader rural context, based on shared or habitual perception — not administrative status, family history, or economic status.

5. Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation:  
This aligns with **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**, as the author uses a socially accepted spatial perception — where Beizheng Street is seen as ""urban"" within a rural context — to define local identity distinctions.

Output: RL1"
