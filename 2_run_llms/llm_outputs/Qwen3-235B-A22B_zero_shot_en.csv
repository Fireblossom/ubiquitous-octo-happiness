热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,RL1**," The author is expressing pride and optimism about the development of the northern part of the city (北门), particularly in comparison to other areas outside the third ring road (三环外). They believe that once the ""火北"" area is developed, the region will significantly improve (""真起飞了""). The tone is one of local identity affirmation and territorial pride.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""北门可不差"" – Implies a positive evaluation of the northern gate area, possibly indicating a sense of local pride or identity.
- ""论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好"" – Makes a **comparative judgment** about the superiority of the northern third ring area over other third ring areas, indicating a **socially conventional territorial identity**.
- ""再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了"" – Suggests that with future development, the area will gain more value or status, reinforcing the idea that the author sees it as a **core local area** with symbolic meaning.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The comparison between 北三环 and other 三环外 areas serves to **elevate the symbolic status** of the northern area and distinguish it as a **core or authentic local space**.
- The phrase ""北门可不差"" functions as a **rejection of negative stereotypes** about the area and an assertion of its legitimacy as a respected local space.
- The author implicitly uses **socially conventional perceptions** of area ranking to argue for 北门's inclusion in the ""true local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author is clearly **endorsing a socially conventional ranking of areas** based on perceived quality and centrality, and using that to define 北门 as a **core local area**.
- There is **no mention of administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic traits, family rootedness, economic assets, or occupational identity**, so those categories are not relevant.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author is using **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they are asserting a mental map or ranking of areas based on **socially accepted perceptions of quality and centrality**, and using that to define 北门 as a **core local area** with symbolic value.

真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL3, RL4"," The author is expressing frustration and observation about how some people in urban centers, particularly in Chengdu, define ""local"" or ""native"" identity in a way that excludes others. They describe instances where urban dwellers claim a superior ""local"" identity and use various criteria to marginalize others as not truly local.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - *“土著” (native)*, *“弯脚杆” (pejorative for non-native)*, *“都江堰的” (place of origin)* → possibly RL1, RL3  
  - *“二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川” (the inner ring is Chengdu, outer ring is Sichuan)* → RL1  
  - *“市中心的不要，要的都是周边的” (downtown locals don't require dowry, surrounding areas do)* → RL1  
  - *“口音” (accent)* → RL4  
  - *“成都那里的” (affiliation with Chengdu)* → RL2 (possibly), RL3 (implicitly)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **critiquing** the logic used by some to define who counts as a ""real local"" in Chengdu.
  - They imply that such criteria (urban centrality, accent, native birthplace) are **used by others** to exclude and marginalize those from surrounding areas.
  - The author **does not endorse** these criteria but **describes how others use them**, particularly in the context of social media interactions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the criteria used by the urbanites (e.g., city center vs. periphery, accent, native birth).
  - However, the author **does implicitly accept** the idea that **place of birth and regional identification** (e.g., being from Dujiangyan, a nearby city) are **used as identity markers**, even if they are not the author’s own standard.
  - The author **does not personally endorse** the urban-centric hierarchy of localness, but **describes it as a real phenomenon** in social discourse.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author describes how some people define the boundary of ""Chengdu"" as only the inner ring, and not including surrounding areas like Dujiangyan. This reflects a conventional, socially accepted boundary of local identity.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author notes how people judge others based on accent (口音), which is used as a marker of being local or not.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The term “土著” (native) implies a historical rootedness, and the author notes that others use this as a standard to distinguish between “true locals” and others.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL1, RL3, RL4`"
我是都江堰的，其他地方的我不敢说，但是我可是从小被成都口音嘲笑哦，我小时候去亲戚家耍过暑假，我说吃饭他们就笑我口音，现在去成都我都不敢开腔，有时候买东西都说普通话，经历过很多次被恶意学我说话,** RL4," The author is sharing a personal experience of being mocked for their local dialect (specifically, the difference between their own dialect and the Chengdu accent), indicating that they believe **linguistic and cultural recognition (specifically accent)** plays a role in how one is perceived as a ""local"" or not.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key elements in the text include:
  - Mention of regional dialect differences (""成都口音"" / Chengdu accent).
  - Personal experience of being laughed at for their accent.
  - Use of Mandarin to avoid being mocked in Chengdu.
  These point to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is clearly describing how accent is used by others (and internalized) as a marker of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses their own linguistic identity and the mocking they received as evidence that **language and accent are key markers used to judge who is a ""real local""**. This supports the idea that the author believes linguistic recognition is an important part of defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does not resist this logic — in fact, they internalize it, choosing to speak Mandarin to avoid being mocked. This indicates that they **implicitly accept** that accent is a criterion for being accepted as a local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The core viewpoint is that **language and accent** are key in determining who is considered a local. This aligns directly with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author's experience shows that dialect and accent are used as criteria for inclusion or exclusion from the ""local"" group.

**Output:** RL4"
那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,"RL1, RL3"," *   The author is expressing frustration and disdain toward someone from Chengdu who constantly emphasizes their family's long-standing local roots (e.g., ""二环以内的"", ""宽窄巷子"") to assert a superior ""local"" identity, which the author finds pretentious and annoying.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""我以前被介绍了个成都人"" – implies a contrast between the speaker and someone from Chengdu (a specific city identity).
  *   ""他家以前二环以内的"" – indicates long-standing local residency.
  *   ""他家以前宽窄巷子的"" – indicates a historically and culturally significant local area.
  *   The overall tone suggests that the person is using their family's historical rootedness and specific local origin to claim a superior ""local"" identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The person from Chengdu is using **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** and **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** to assert their local identity.
  *   The author strongly **resists and mocks** this behavior, indicating they **do not endorse** these criteria for defining ""local"" identity.
  *   However, the text **implies that the person themselves believes in these RL-based identity criteria**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although the author resists the criteria, they are **explicitly describing someone else's use of these criteria to define local identity**, and the **text centers on the critique of these identity standards**.
  *   Since the author is **not endorsing** these standards, but rather **exposing and mocking** them, the standards are still **part of the author's argument about how others define ""local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL3** is clearly involved: the person emphasizes their family's long-standing presence in the area (""他家以前二环以内的"", ""他家以前宽窄巷子的"").
  *   **RL1** is also involved: the specific mention of well-known, historically significant urban areas like ""宽窄巷子"" implies a socially accepted view of ""core local"" territory.
  *   These RLs are **not endorsed by the author**, but they are **used in the author’s critique** of how others define local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL1, RL3"
那证明成都人的确不咋地，本来成都话口音离普通话语区就够偏了，很多怪音，他们还歧视本省的人，无语了都，儿化音就像大舌头一样，这是外地人评价的，为什么有些区县的来到成都要模仿他们的口音，本来就难听还要模仿是自己也不自信，大胆保持自己的地方本土特色有什么？,"** RL1, RL4"," The author is criticizing certain attitudes and behaviors they associate with people from Chengdu, particularly their perceived linguistic arrogance and the tendency of people from other Sichuanese regions to imitate the Chengdu dialect despite finding it unappealing. The author suggests that maintaining one’s own linguistic and cultural identity is more authentic and preferable than imitating the perceived ""superior"" Chengdu accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""成都话口音"" (Chengdu dialect accent)** → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - **""儿化音就像大舌头一样"" (Erhua sounds like a lisp)** → RL4
  - **""外地人评价"" (evaluation by outsiders)** → RL4
  - **""模仿他们的口音"" (imitating their accent)** → RL4
  - **""保持自己的地方本土特色"" (keep one’s own local characteristics)** → RL4 + RL1 (implied local identity through cultural distinctiveness)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **linguistic features** (RL4) to evaluate and critique what constitutes authentic local identity. They are critical of both the Chengdu dialect and the behavior of other Sichuanese speakers who imitate it, suggesting that **language is a key marker of local identity** and that **authenticity is compromised by mimicry**.
  - The suggestion to “keep one’s own local characteristics” implies a belief in **distinct, rooted cultural identities tied to specific regions** (RL1 and RL4), and that these should be preserved rather than erased in favor of a dominant dialect.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **linguistic identity (RL4)** as a criterion for evaluating local belonging and authenticity.
  - They also imply a **conventional, rooted sense of local identity (RL1)**, where maintaining one’s own local traits is a form of cultural legitimacy.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s argument hinges on **language and accent (RL4)** as key indicators of local identity, and they criticize the imitation of Chengdu speech as inauthentic.
  - They also suggest that there is a **conventional or expected cultural identity tied to one’s original region (RL1)**, and that abandoning it for a dominant urban dialect is misguided.

**Output:** RL1, RL4"
我朋友都江堰人在成都十多年现在已经是成都口音了，我估计是她怕融入不了所以就变成那样了吧,"**  
RL4"," * The author is expressing the idea that their friend, originally from Dujiangyan (a city in Sichuan province), has lived in Chengdu for over a decade and has now adopted a Chengdu accent. The author speculates that this change in accent is due to the friend's fear of not being able to integrate into Chengdu society.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * **""都江堰人"" (a person from Dujiangyan):** This refers to the speaker's friend's original regional identity.
  * **""成都十多年"" (living in Chengdu for over ten years):** Indicates the length of time the person has lived in Chengdu.
  * **""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent):** Refers to a local linguistic trait.
  * **""怕融入不了"" (afraid of not integrating):** Suggests that the friend is trying to adopt local characteristics (specifically accent) in order to be accepted as part of the local community.
  * **""变成那样"" (became like that):** Implies a transformation in behavior or identity to match local norms.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is suggesting that the friend's change in accent is a **strategy for social integration**, indicating that **language or accent (specifically Chengdu accent)** is perceived as a **key marker of local identity** in Chengdu.
  * The phrase ""怕融入不了"" implies that the author believes **not having the local accent** might be a **barrier to being accepted as a local**, and thus the friend changes her speech to overcome that barrier.
  * The author does **not emphasize administrative boundaries, birthplace, family history, or economic status**, so those are not central to their argument.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The key criterion the author is endorsing is **linguistic identity** — specifically **speaking with a local accent** — as a **means to be accepted or integrated into the local group**.
  * This aligns with the **RL4** category, which focuses on **language, accent, and cultural habits** as criteria for **identifying who belongs to the local group**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is making the implicit claim that **speaking with a Chengdu accent** is a **key feature of being accepted as a local in Chengdu**. The friend's change in speech is interpreted as an **attempt to conform to this standard**, and the author seems to accept this as a valid or necessary step for integration.
  * Therefore, the author is endorsing **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** as a criterion for defining ""local identity"".

**Output:**  
RL4"
我也都江堰的，被别个说口音难听,RL4," *   The author is expressing a personal experience of being mocked for their accent, which implies that **accent or linguistic features are being used by others to judge or define who is considered a ""local""** in the context of identity.
  *   The author implicitly resists this judgment by expressing discomfort or disagreement, but the **text reveals that linguistic features (accent) are being used as a criterion for local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""都江堰的"" – indicates a self-claimed local identity.
  *   ""说口音难听"" – indicates that **accent** is being used as a criterion to judge or exclude someone from being considered local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""我也都江堰的"" shows that the author identifies as a local, establishing their **subjective claim to local identity**.
  *   ""被别个说口音难听"" shows that **others are using accent as a marker to judge local identity**, which the author experiences as exclusionary.
  *   The author does not endorse accent as a valid criterion but **reveals that it is used by others**, and this usage is part of the **social dynamics around defining ""local""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not explicitly endorse** accent as a valid criterion for local identity.
  *   However, the author **implicitly conveys that others use accent as a criterion**, and this is part of the **social perception and judgment of local identity**, which the author is responding to.
  *   Since the text is about how **accent is used in the social construction of local identity**, and the author is **responding to that usage**, it qualifies as part of the **cultural-linguistic recognition framework**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text involves **linguistic features (accent)** being used as a **marker of local identity**, even if the author does not personally endorse it.
  *   This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it involves **judging someone’s local status based on accent**, even if the author resists it.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL4"
哈哈哈 真的 确实 因为以前的周边的确实很弯 一说话就嫌弃 其实现在也一样 土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显 但对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走,"**  
RL4"," The author is expressing their observation and experience regarding how local identity in Chengdu is perceived, particularly through **linguistic and cultural cues**. They note that locals (especially those from within the 1st ring road) can immediately identify non-locals by their accent and show a subtle form of **social distinction**, while at the same time being very **welcoming and helpful to outsiders**. The key idea is that **accent and cultural behavior** are used as markers of being ""local"" in Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土著一听就晓得你不是成都的(一环内的)那个口音明显"" → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** – The author clearly states that **accent is a key marker** used by locals to identify outsiders.
  - ""对外地人真的热情 问路啥都恨不得带别人走"" → This reflects **cultural behavior** and **attitudes toward outsiders**, reinforcing the **linguistic and behavioral norms** that distinguish locals from non-locals, again pointing to **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **accent distinction** serves as a **core functional marker** of local identity in Chengdu, used by locals themselves to identify outsiders.
  - The **contrast in behavior** (locals identifying outsiders vs. being helpful to them) further emphasizes the **cultural boundary** and **norms of interaction** that define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **accent and speech patterns** are key to identifying local identity.
  - The **cultural behavior** (helpfulness to outsiders) is also described as a **trait of locals**, contributing to the **definition of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly uses **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** to define who is considered a local in Chengdu. The **accent**, especially among inner-city residents, is seen as a **symbolic boundary** that distinguishes locals from outsiders.
  - The **cultural behavior** (being helpful to outsiders) also contributes to a **normative understanding** of what it means to be a local in Chengdu, further reinforcing **RL4**.

**Output:**

我内江的，挨着自贡方向，说话是纯正自贡口音，在成都十多年了，也在一环买了房子，直到现在我说话也是纯正自贡口音。说话就是交流，能听懂就行了，出自哪里不重要，自己有本事才是最重要的。从来不为口音是哪里而焦虑，也不需要去在意他人的看法，有这样看法的人也是肤浅，不值得交集，更不值得因此自我内耗,N/A," The author is expressing a personal viewpoint that **origin or accent should not be a basis for judging someone’s identity or worth**, and that **personal ability and self-perception are more important**. They explicitly reject the idea that accent or place of origin should carry symbolic or evaluative weight in determining who is “local” or who belongs in a social or urban context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""说话是纯正自贡口音"" – RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - ""出自哪里不重要"" – **Negation of RL1, RL3, RL4**
  - ""自己有本事才是最重要的"" – **Not an RL category; personal philosophy**
  - ""从来不为口音是哪里而焦虑"" – **Rejection of RL4 as a criterion**
  - ""有这样看法的人也是肤浅"" – **Criticism of those who use RL4 or RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - Mention of **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is used to **illustrate what the author rejects** as a meaningful or valid basis for defining local identity.
  - The author **explicitly dismisses** the importance of **place of origin (RL1)**, **accent (RL4)**, and **family or historical rootedness (RL3)**.
  - The author **promotes individual ability and self-determination**, which are **not part of the RL framework** and thus **not annotated**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria.
  - Instead, they **reject RL1, RL3, and RL4** as valid bases for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s argument is built on **rejecting the legitimacy of using accent or place of origin** to judge local identity.
  - This implies that **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is a **criterion that exists in public discourse**, but the author **explicitly opposes** it.
  - Since the task is to **identify what the author endorses or implies as valid criteria**, and the author **rejects all RL-based criteria**, **no RL category applies**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output:"
我不内耗我也不觉得我们口音不好听，我只是觉得有些成都人笑别人很无语,"** RL4, RL1"," The author is expressing a personal stance of self-acceptance and non-judgment. They are not bothered by internal conflict (内耗) or by the perception that their accent is unattractive. However, they find it ridiculous when some people from Chengdu mock others, implying that such behavior is unwarranted and perhaps contrary to a more inclusive or self-assured local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""我们口音"" (our accent)** – Points to linguistic identity.
  - **""成都人笑别人"" (Chengdu people laughing at others)** – Suggests a social boundary or exclusionary behavior based on identity, possibly linguistic or cultural.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **accent** is used by the author to affirm their own sense of identity and to reject the idea that their speech is inferior. It plays a role in defining who belongs to the ""local"" group.
  - The **mocking behavior of some Chengdu people** is used to critique exclusionary or elitist attitudes. This implies that the author does **not** endorse using such behavior as a criterion for defining ""local"" identity, but rather sees it as a flawed trait. However, the fact that the author mentions ""Chengdu people"" mocking others suggests that **they are aware of a cultural tendency among some locals to draw boundaries**, even if they disapprove of it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** linguistic identity (their own accent) as part of what constitutes a ""local"" identity.
  - The author **does not endorse** exclusionary behavior or social mockery as valid criteria for defining ""local"" identity, but the mention of such behavior still reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity logic** (RL1), as it is tied to how locals perceive and define themselves in contrast to others.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author affirms their own accent as not being ""bad,"" which implies that linguistic identity is a factor in defining who is local. This aligns with RL4.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Although the author critiques the behavior, the fact that they mention ""some Chengdu people"" mocking others reflects a conventional perception of group boundaries and identity distinctions, which is part of the socially conventional territorial logic.

**Output:** RL4, RL1"
你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,** RL4," The author is expressing a sense of **cultural-linguistic marginalization** — they are pointing out that their local dialect or accent is being looked down upon or socially devalued by others. The core expressive intent is to **highlight a form of identity-based discrimination**, where the speaker's linguistic trait — their accent — is used to **exclude them from a socially accepted ""local"" identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is: **“我们口音很贱” (our accent is lowly/cheap/disgraceful)**.
  This clearly touches on **linguistic identity**, and the speaker is indicating that their accent is a **marker of local identity**, but one that is **socially degraded**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase functions as a **critique of linguistic-based social exclusion**. The speaker is not celebrating or endorsing the accent, but they are **affirming that it is a marker of local identity** — and that this identity is being **denigrated by others**. Therefore, the author implicitly **acknowledges the role of accent in defining local identity**, even if they are resisting the associated stigma.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does not resist the idea that accent is a **criterion for identifying locals** — in fact, they are highlighting that it is used **against them**. Therefore, the author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **accent (and by extension, dialect and linguistic traits)** is a **criterion used to define local identity**, even if they are criticizing the associated prejudice.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This clearly matches **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which includes criteria such as **accent, dialect, and local linguistic habits** being used to **identify insiders vs. outsiders**, or to **define local identity**.

**Output:** RL4"
哈哈，就是，而且我有个同事达州的，他说他的口音才是正宗成都话,N/A," *   The author is sharing an anecdote about a colleague from Dazhou who claims to speak ""authentic"" Chengdu dialect. The author seems to be highlighting the idea that someone from outside Chengdu (Dazhou is a different city in Sichuan Province) can speak Chengdu dialect so well that they even claim it as their own. This implies a subtle challenge to the idea that dialect alone defines local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - Dialect (""口音"", ""成都话"") → potentially linked to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
  *   - Mention of colleague being from Dazhou but speaking Chengdu dialect → suggests a **distinction between origin and linguistic assimilation**
  *   - Implicit contrast between **birthplace** and **linguistic identity**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of dialect is used to **highlight a perceived irony or contrast**: someone not originally from Chengdu claims to have the ""authentic"" local dialect. This implies that the author does **not fully endorse** dialect alone as a definitive criterion for being ""local"". Instead, the tone seems to **question or subtly mock** the idea that speaking the dialect equates to being local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although dialect is mentioned, the author does **not endorse** it as a valid or sufficient criterion for defining local identity. Rather, the author seems to **implicitly resist** this notion by pointing out its potential for misrepresentation or overclaim.
  *   Therefore, **no RL category is directly endorsed** by the author as a valid criterion for defining ""local identity"" in this snippet.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   While the text touches on **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**, it does so in a way that **questions its validity** rather than endorsing it. The author seems to suggest that dialect can be misleading or even appropriated, and thus should not be the sole or definitive marker of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
  Output:"
哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个,RL4," The author is making a humorous or mocking remark about someone else's accent, using the phrase “口音很贱” (the accent is very low/bad). This implies a negative evaluation of the way someone speaks, which is being used as a basis to judge or comment on that person's identity or social standing. The laughter (""哈哈哈哈"") suggests a tone of mockery or shared amusement at the perceived inferiority of the accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The key phrase “口音很贱” (the accent is very low/bad) directly references **language or accent**.
  - This evaluation is not just about aesthetics but implies a judgment about the speaker's identity or belonging.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase functions as a **criterion for evaluating someone’s identity or status**, implying that the speaker does not belong to a locally accepted or respected group.
  - The author is **endorsing accent as a marker of identity**, using it to distinguish between ""us"" (those with a ""good"" or accepted accent) and ""them"" (those with a ""贱"" accent).
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is using accent as a symbolic marker to judge whether someone is ""local"" or not, or to mock their perceived lack of local belonging.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is clearly using **accent** as a standard to evaluate or mock someone’s local identity.
  - This is not a resisted or negated criterion; it is **explicitly used by the author** to make a judgment.
  - Therefore, it qualifies under **RL4**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that accent is a valid or meaningful criterion for judging someone’s local identity or social standing.
  - This fits the RL4 definition: using **language or accent** as a basis to determine whether someone belongs to the ""local people"" group or possesses ""local"" characteristics.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL4"
重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小，重要是带不带口音口音改不到撒,RL4," The author is emphasizing that **linguistic identity** — specifically, whether one has a local accent and whether they can or cannot change it — is a **key determinant of local identity**. The author contrasts this with other factors like property ownership, the number of houses, or housing quality, which are dismissed as less important.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""带不带口音"" (having an accent) and ""口音改不到"" (accent can't be changed) are key linguistic indicators.
  - ""几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小"" (number of houses, location, old and small housing) are **explicitly dismissed** as key criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **mention of accent** plays a **central role** in the author's argument: it is presented as a **core, unchangeable marker** of local identity.
  - The **mention of housing and property** serves a **contrasting role** — it is used to **reject** these as valid criteria for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only the **linguistic criterion** (accent) is **endorsed** and used to define local identity.
  - Housing and property are **explicitly de-emphasized**, so **RL5 and RL6 are excluded**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as accent is a **core, unchangeable** feature used to judge whether someone is considered a local.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL4"
还有外地人骂成都口音难听呢，逼着他来成都了？,RL4," The author is expressing indignation and refuting the idea that the Chengdu accent is unpleasant, implying that those who criticize it are outsiders who don't understand or belong to the local culture. The author is defending the local dialect and, by extension, the cultural identity of Chengdu locals.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""外地人"" (non-local people) — suggests a distinction between locals and outsiders.
  - ""成都口音"" (Chengdu accent) — a linguistic feature.
  - Implicit contrast between those who accept and those who criticize the local accent — suggesting linguistic identity as a boundary marker for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of the Chengdu accent plays a **definitional role** in distinguishing between locals and outsiders. The rhetorical question implies that only someone who accepts or naturally speaks the accent can be considered a true local.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that speaking the local accent is a criterion for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** or negate the use of accent as a marker — instead, they **imply that criticizing the accent disqualifies one from being local**.
  - The use of accent as a boundary marker for local identity is **clearly present and endorsed**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author uses the local accent as a marker to distinguish between locals and outsiders.

**Step 6: Output Result**

我也不知道我算不算成都人，爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都，我户口在成都。但是妈妈是外地人，我爸妈都在我妈妈的城市工作。从小我跟着爸妈在我妈妈出生的城市生活，小时候放假回成都，和小朋友玩要被骂乡巴佬，所以导致我小时候不愿意回成都，一直到读研才回的成都，读完研就出国了，现在回成都快3年，不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话，总被同事说我说的四川话有口音，我也一直对成都没有认同感。,"** RL1, RL3, RL4"," The author is expressing a personal struggle with their identity as a ""Chengdu native"" (成都人). Despite having **family rooted in Chengdu** (father, grandparents), **a Chengdu hukou**, and **blood ties**, they were **raised in another city**, **did not grow up in Chengdu**, and **feel socially excluded** when they did visit. They also mention **lack of fluency in the local dialect**, being **linguistically marked as an outsider**, and **lack of emotional attachment or认同感 (identity认同)** with Chengdu. The author is essentially questioning whether they are ""local"" based on various identity markers.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** ""我户口在成都"" (My hukou is in Chengdu)
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** ""爸爸是成都人，爷爷奶奶也生活在成都"" (My father is from Chengdu, grandparents also live there), ""从小我跟着爸妈在我妈妈出生的城市生活"" (I grew up in my mother’s hometown), ""读研才回的成都"" (Came back to Chengdu for grad school)
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** ""不太会说成都话，听得懂，但愿意说四川话...总被同事说我说的四川话有口音"" (Not fluent in Chengdu dialect, but can understand; speaks Sichuan Mandarin with an accent and is mocked for it)
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** ""小时候放假回成都，和小朋友玩要被骂乡巴佬"" (When I visited Chengdu as a child, local kids would call me a hick), indicating a **social boundary** and **insider/outsider distinction** based on perceived regional identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL2 (Hukou):** The author has a Chengdu hukou, which in many contexts would **officially label them as a local**, but this **does not translate into felt identity or social recognition**. The author does not use this to affirm their local identity, and instead seems to question its sufficiency.
- **RL3 (Family history and upbringing):** The author **was born into a Chengdu-rooted family** but **grew up elsewhere**, which they describe as a key reason for their **lack of identification with Chengdu**. They **explicitly contrast** this upbringing with that of locals.
- **RL4 (Language):** The author's **lack of fluency in Chengdu dialect and presence of an accent** is **used by others to mark them as non-local**, and the author **does not resist this logic**, instead feeling alienated by it.
- **RL1 (Social boundary):** The experience of being called a ""hick"" when visiting Chengdu shows a **socially conventional boundary** drawn by locals to **exclude those not raised there**, which the author experienced and internalized.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **does not endorse hukou (RL2)** as sufficient for being considered a local.
- The author **does emphasize upbringing (RL3), language and accent (RL4), and social exclusion (RL1)** as **central to their perceived lack of local identity**.
- These are **not resisted** by the author but are instead **used to explain why they feel they are not accepted or do not feel like a local**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL1:** The author experienced **social exclusion** and **identity boundary drawing** in Chengdu as a child, reinforcing a conventional **insider/outsider distinction**.
- **RL3:** The author contrasts their upbringing outside of Chengdu with locals who were **born and raised there**, implying this is a **key criterion for being seen as a true local**.
- **RL4:** The author's **linguistic difference** and being **marked by accent** are **used to exclude them** from local identity, which they accept as a real barrier.

**RL Criteria the author implicitly endorses as defining ""local"":**
- **Growing up in the place (RL3)**
- **Cultural-linguistic fluency (RL4)**
- **Socially conventional territorial boundaries (RL1)**

**Output:** RL1, RL3, RL4"
一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,None," The author is expressing frustration and a sense of marginalization, implying that people are being judged or targeted online due to characteristics such as **accent** and **appearance**, which are being used to label them as outsiders or non-locals.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **“一个口音”** (an accent) – potentially related to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
  - **“一个面”** (a face/appearance) – could imply physical appearance or stereotyping, not directly tied to any RL category unless linked to cultural or territorial identity
  - **“我们天天被网暴”** (we are cyberbullied every day) – suggests social exclusion or discrimination, possibly rooted in perceived identity markers
  - **“门都不敢出”** (dare not go out) – reflects the emotional and psychological impact of this exclusion

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The **accent** is being used as a **marker of identity** that leads to social discrimination and online harassment. The author implicitly conveys that this is **how people are judged as “local” or not**, even if they are.
  - The **appearance** (""一个面"") is likely being used similarly – **as a visual or stereotypical cue** for others to assume the speaker’s outsider status.
  - These elements are not just described; they are **central to the author’s complaint**, indicating that **they are being used by others as criteria to judge local identity**, even if the author resists or suffers from this logic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the use of accent or appearance to define local identity; rather, they are **resisting** it as a harmful or unfair standard.
  - Therefore, these elements **should not be annotated**, as per the core limitation: **criteria that the author resists or is negatively affected by should not be annotated**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - Although **“口音”** (accent) aligns with **RL4**, the author does **not endorse** it as a valid or fair standard for defining local identity.
  - The author is **complaining about** the misuse of such criteria, not **endorsing** them.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: None"
就是。。。基本上现在接到那些骚扰电话都是外地口音哎，不是歧视外地人，只是觉得如果他们回老家，做点其他工作，也比鼓捣留在成都打骚扰电话好嘛,"RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing frustration about receiving nuisance calls from people with non-local (non-Chengdu) accents. While they clarify they are not being discriminatory, they imply that these individuals are not contributing positively to the local society and would be better off returning to their hometowns to work. The underlying idea is that **people who are not locally rooted may not belong in the local space**, especially if their presence is associated with undesirable behavior.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “骚扰电话都是外地口音” (nuisance calls are all from people with non-local accents) → relates to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author uses accent to distinguish between ""locals"" and ""non-locals"".
  - The implied contrast between “外地人” (non-locals) and the idea that they should go back to their hometowns → relates to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects an implicit assumption that people should stay in their ""place of origin"" and not intrude upon another's local space.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The use of accent to identify who is making nuisance calls serves to **construct a boundary** between local and non-local, implying that non-locals are the source of disturbance and thus not fully integrated or accepted within the local community. This supports **RL4**.
  - The idea that people should go back to their hometowns implies a **conventional understanding of territorial belonging**, where each person has a ""proper"" place they belong to, reinforcing **RL1**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL1** and **RL4** are used by the author to support the idea that there is a distinction between locals and non-locals, and that non-locals (identified by accent and presumed origin) are not ideally present in the local space. These are **not explicitly resisted** and are used to define or imply who is considered part of the ""local"" community.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is reflected in the author’s assumption that people have a proper place (their hometown), and that they should stay there rather than intrude on Chengdu.
  - **RL4** is reflected in the use of accent to distinguish between locals and non-locals, which becomes a marker of identity and possibly of social acceptance.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1, RL4"
之前在成都上学遇到两个女的 就不是成都人 四川其他地方的 非要说自己是成都人 只是亲戚在双流买了房子而已各种也装的要死 我真的想问这有什么好优越的吗自己的土生土长的地方都不承认,"RL1, RL3"," * The author expresses frustration and disdain toward two women from other parts of Sichuan who claim to be ""Chengdu locals"" merely because their relatives bought a house in Shuangliu (a district of Chengdu). The author questions the logic and value of such a claim, suggesting that these individuals are inauthentically trying to adopt a local identity for perceived social advantage.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""不是成都人，四川其他地方的"" — indicates a distinction based on **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** (they were not born or raised in Chengdu).
  * ""亲戚在双流买了房子"" — refers to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** (property ownership in a specific area, but the author dismisses this as a shallow basis for claiming local identity).
  * The author implicitly contrasts ""real"" locals with those who are not ""土生土长"" — this directly supports **RL3** again.
  * The act of claiming to be Chengdu locals based on property in Shuangliu implies a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), as the author is pushing back against a broad or symbolic extension of ""Chengdu"" to include Shuangliu in a way that is not traditionally accepted.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * **RL3** is central: the author believes that being ""born and raised"" in Chengdu is the authentic basis for claiming local identity. This supports the idea that local identity is rooted in personal or family history, not superficial connections.
  * **RL6** is mentioned (property ownership), but the author clearly **rejects** it as a valid criterion. Therefore, it should **not** be annotated.
  * **RL1** is relevant because the author is defending a traditional or conventional understanding of what areas are considered part of the ""local"" Chengdu identity — Shuangliu is not seen as symbolically equivalent to being a ""true"" Chengdu local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author explicitly endorses **RL3** (born and raised locally) as the legitimate basis for claiming to be a Chengdu local.
  * The author implicitly defends a **traditional or conventional understanding of Chengdu’s identity**, rejecting the idea that living in Shuangliu (or having family there) makes one a Chengdu person — this supports **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1** is used to define the symbolic or socially accepted boundaries of what counts as ""Chengdu"" — the author implies that Shuangliu is not symbolically or socially part of the core Chengdu identity.
  * **RL3** is used to define who counts as a ""real"" local — someone who is ""土生土长"" (born and raised there).

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL1, RL3`"
我也想说，我那个农村老板在成都买房了，经常给我说我现在也是成都本地人了，创业初成功经常在那吹嘘自己🐮逼，神戳戳的，他不在别的同事面前说他是成都户口了因为其他人不是土著,"RL3, RL4"," The author is expressing a critical and somewhat mocking attitude toward their rural-born boss who has recently bought property in Chengdu and now claims to be a ""local"" Chengdu person. The key point the author is making is that merely owning property or recently living in Chengdu does not, in their view, make someone a ""real"" local — especially when others (who are not locals) are not around to hear these claims. The implication is that the boss is trying to adopt a local identity that he hasn't truly earned.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “买房了” (bought property) → potentially linked to **RL6**, as real estate ownership may be used to claim social or local status.
  - “我现在也是成都本地人了” (I am also a local Chengdu person now) → indicates a self-proclaimed change in local identity, which the author mocks.
  - “户口” (hukou) → directly mentioned as a criterion for being considered local → **RL2**.
  - “其他同事不是土著” (other colleagues are not natives) → implies a distinction between ""true locals"" and others, and that the boss avoids making such claims in front of non-locals → suggests the author believes in a more rooted, possibly generational or cultural, standard for being local.
  - The overall tone implies that the author believes being a ""local"" requires more than just legal or residential status — possibly cultural or generational rootedness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (户口)**: The boss uses hukou as a basis to claim local identity, but the author mocks this and implies it's not sufficient — thus, the author **resists** this as a valid criterion.
  - **RL6 (买房)**: Owning property is linked to the boss’s claim of being local, but again, the author implies that this alone doesn’t make someone local — so this is also **resisted** as a valid criterion.
  - The author implies that **true local identity** must involve something deeper — likely rooted in generational or cultural belonging, which the boss lacks. This suggests **RL3** (family rootedness) and **RL4** (cultural/linguistic belonging) are **endorsed implicitly** as the real criteria for being a local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** RL2 or RL6 as valid for defining locals — these are **resisted**.
  - The author **implies endorsement** of a more rooted, possibly generational or cultural, identity — which corresponds to **RL3** and **RL4**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author seems to believe that being a ""real"" local requires deeper roots — likely implying that the boss lacks generational or long-term local upbringing.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The boss's behavior of only claiming to be local when non-locals aren't around suggests he doesn't truly belong culturally or linguistically — a point the author mocks, implying that this is a necessary criterion for being considered local.

**Step 6: Output Result**

我倒觉得是外来的多了故意在那点火，成都越扩越大本来对我爸妈这种老一辈是不好区分的，现在离成都二三环内天远地远的地方也叫成都，结果一导航开过车过来还要老半天比去隔壁几个市坐高铁时间都长还不如说原来的某某地名好记，老一辈是不习惯啊，然后就说歧视了,** RL1," The author is expressing a nuanced view that as **Chengdu expands**, the **mental map and emotional identification** with what ""Chengdu"" or ""local"" means has become **blurred or stretched**, especially for the older generation. They imply that the **socially conventional understanding of ""local""** (i.e., the core urban area) is being **undermined by administrative or physical expansion**, which leads to **confusion and identity discomfort**. The author **does not endorse** using convenience of travel or administrative naming as a valid basis for defining local identity. Instead, they seem to support a **traditional, socially conventional understanding** of where ""counts"" as Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   “成都越扩越大” (Chengdu is expanding more and more)
  *   “我爸妈这种老一辈是不好区分的” (Older generations like my parents find it hard to distinguish)
  *   “离成都二三环内天远地远的地方也叫成都” (Places far from the 2nd and 3rd ring roads are still called Chengdu)
  *   “导航开过车过来还要老半天” (Driving there takes forever even with navigation)
  *   “比去隔壁几个市坐高铁时间都长” (Takes longer than taking a high-speed train to neighboring cities)
  *   “还不如说原来的某某地名好记” (Older place names were easier to remember)
  *   “老一辈是不习惯啊” (Older generations are not used to it)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   The **author is contrasting** the **traditional, socially accepted understanding** of where Chengdu ""truly"" is, versus the **new, expanded administrative definition**.
  *   The **core issue** is not administrative legitimacy per se, but the **mental and emotional disconnect** that comes from stretching the symbolic boundary of ""Chengdu"" too far.
  *   The author **implies that the older, more compact, socially conventional understanding of Chengdu** is more meaningful and **more aligned with local identity**, especially for long-term residents or older generations.
  *   The **author resists the idea** that just because a place is **named Chengdu administratively**, it should be **mentally or emotionally accepted as part of ""local"" Chengdu**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The **author endorses** the idea that **local identity is tied to a socially conventional, emotionally rooted understanding of the city's boundaries**.
  *   They **do not endorse** administrative expansion or functional travel time as valid criteria for defining ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  *   The **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly endorsed by the author. They are **advocating for a traditional, socially accepted boundary** of what counts as Chengdu, especially from the perspective of older residents.
  *   Other RL categories like RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) and RL5 (Functional Livability) are **mentioned but not endorsed**—they are used to **critique the current situation**, not to define local identity.

The author also emphasizes a cultural attitude among Chengdu locals — they do not envy the rich and maintain a peaceful, independent lifestyle. Additionally, the author notes that wealthy areas in Chengdu are often occupied by outsiders who made their money elsewhere and then moved to Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土著"" (local people) are defined in contrast to wealthy outsiders.
  - ""不愁房子住，另外有多余的房子可以出租出去"" implies property ownership and economic stability linked to local identity.
  - ""成都人天生一副你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕各过各的谁也不碍着谁"" reflects a cultural attitude and lifestyle that distinguishes locals.
  - ""那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的，多是外地赚了钱来成都消费或者安置的"" contrasts local identity with outsiders moving into wealthy areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Property Ownership / Economic Stability (RL6):** The author implies that local identity is associated with owning property and having a stable, modest lifestyle. This contributes to the idea that locals have deep social and economic roots in Chengdu.
  - **Cultural Attitude / Lifestyle (RL4):** The cultural attitude of not envying the rich and living independently is used to distinguish locals from outsiders, indicating a cultural-linguistic form of local identity.
  - **Wealthy Areas and Outsiders (RL1, RL2):** The author contrasts ""local"" areas (where people live modestly with property security) with ""wealthy"" areas dominated by outsiders. This implies a territorial and social boundary based on local identity, though not explicitly administrative or conventional.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that **local Chengdu identity** is tied to **cultural attitude (RL4)** and **property/economic rootedness (RL6)**.
  - The mention of ""土著"" and lifestyle implies a **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**, as the author distinguishes locals from outsiders in specific areas.
  - There is **no explicit endorsement of administrative boundaries (RL2)** or household registration, and **no emphasis on language or dialect (RL4 is already covered)**, **growth history (RL3)**, **livability (RL5)**, or **occupation (RL7)**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly defines local Chengdu people as those who live in certain areas with a modest, property-based lifestyle, contrasting with wealthy areas occupied by outsiders.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The cultural attitude of not envying the rich and living independently is a key marker of local identity.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** Property ownership and economic stability (rental income, modest but sufficient income) are used to distinguish locals from outsiders.

**Output:** RL1, RL4, RL6"
我崇州的嘛 我们身边的人被问到是哪里的 都直接说崇州 不会说是成都的从小到大耳濡目染的就是成都人都觉得三环以外的不算成都的,RL1," *   The author is expressing a strong sense of **local identity rooted in social convention and mental mapping**, specifically rejecting the broader administrative label (""成都的"" / Chengdu native) in favor of a more specific and socially accepted local identity (""崇州的"" / Chongzhou native).  
  *   They also imply that **within the broader Chengdu area, there is a socially accepted boundary** (e.g., ""三环以外的不算成都的"") that defines who is ""really"" considered a local, which is not aligned with administrative definitions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""崇州的嘛"" – indicates personal identification with a specific local area (Chongzhou), distinct from Chengdu.
  *   ""不会说是成都的"" – suggests a **socially conventional understanding** that Chongzhou is not considered ""core Chengdu"".
  *   ""从小到大耳濡目染的就是成都人都觉得三环以外的不算成都的"" – reflects a **socially shared perception** that defines the boundary of ""local Chengdu identity"" based on a conventional mental map.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   These elements collectively serve to **construct a socially accepted boundary of ""local identity""** that differs from administrative or official definitions.
  *   The author **does not endorse the administrative boundary** (Chengdu) as a valid marker of local identity.
  *   Instead, they **endorse a conventional, culturally transmitted understanding** of who counts as a ""local"" in the Chengdu area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** a **socially conventional mental map** that excludes certain areas (e.g., beyond the 3rd ring) from being considered ""local Chengdu"".
  *   They also **implicitly endorse** the idea that local identity is tied to **specific sub-regions** (e.g., Chongzhou) rather than the broader administrative city.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), or other categories.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's argument is built on a **socially conventional understanding of territorial identity** that defines who is considered ""local"" in Chengdu.
  *   This aligns directly with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a **socially accepted mental map** that defines local identity boundaries.

**Step 6: Output Result**

话说什么是土著，我认为从爷爷辈土生土长开始才算是土著，那些从外地拿到成都户口或者父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃，然后很骄傲的弯酸，这种不算，并且所谓的成都人假打90%以上都是这种人,RL3," The author is clearly putting forward a **strict definition of ""local people"" (土著)**, emphasizing that **only those whose family roots go back at least to the grandfather generation in the local area can be considered ""true locals""**. The author explicitly excludes those who obtained Chengdu hukou (household registration) or whose parents moved there and then claim local identity with pride, calling such people ""fake"" and ""hypocritical"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase **""从爷爷辈土生土长开始才算是土著""** clearly emphasizes **family historical rootedness** — this is a strong indicator of **RL3**.
  - The exclusion of those who **""从外地拿到成都户口""** implies a **distinction based on administrative legitimacy**, but the author **resists** this as a valid criterion — so **RL2 is not endorsed**.
  - The phrase **""父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃""** further reinforces the author's emphasis on **multi-generational rootedness**, again pointing to **RL3**.
  - The emotional and identity-based exclusion of these groups implies a **social boundary**, but it's derived from **historical rootedness**, not from territorial identity or linguistic/cultural factors — so **RL1 and RL4 are not directly endorsed**.
  - No mention of **environmental quality, social roots, or occupational symbolism** — so **RL5, RL6, and RL7 are not relevant**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **RL3** as the **core standard** to distinguish between ""true locals"" and others.
  - The author **resists** the idea that hukou (RL2) or local-born children of migrants (still only one generation) are sufficient for being considered ""local"".
  - The tone is evaluative and exclusionary, with **RL3 as the only accepted criterion**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** is **explicitly endorsed** by the author as the **legitimate basis for defining ""local identity""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **only those whose family has been rooted in the area for multiple generations** (at least back to the grandfather's generation) can be considered ""true locals"" or ""土著"".
  - This clearly aligns with **RL3**, which defines local identity based on **family historical rootedness** and **generational heritage**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3"
我觉得哪个地方的土著都会多少有点优越感吧……毕竟是土生土长本地人 对吧,** RL3," *   The author expresses a general observation or belief that indigenous or native people of a place (""土著"") tend to have a sense of superiority because they are ""本地人"" (local people), and this seems to be based on their being ""土生土长"" — born and raised in the place.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Key phrase: ""土生土长本地人"" — this strongly points to **RL3**, which focuses on being born and raised in the area as a basis for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""土生土长"" is used to **justify or explain** why local people might feel a sense of superiority — implying that **being born and raised in the place is a criterion the author associates with being a ""true local""**, and that this status naturally leads to a sense of superiority.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) is a **valid basis for local identity**, and this underpins the sense of superiority they describe.
  *   No other RL categories are clearly endorsed or implied in this short statement.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that being born and raised in a place (土生土长) is a **key marker of being a ""local person""**, and this is used to explain a commonly observed social phenomenon — that locals often feel superior.
  *   This aligns with **RL3**, which defines local identity based on an individual's or family's **birth and growth history in the local area**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
**Output:** RL3"
我没觉得喃，每次回去都觉得多亲切的，被烧的时候一点感觉都没有，我还是土生土长成都女娃儿，一点口音都没有，一样被烧,RL3," The author is expressing a personal experience of feeling a strong sense of local identity and emotional attachment to Chengdu, despite lacking a local accent — a commonly assumed marker of being ""local"". She emphasizes that being a ""native daughter"" (土生土长) of Chengdu is what matters, not whether one speaks the dialect or has an accent. The tone suggests resistance to the idea that accent or language is a decisive factor in judging local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “土生土长成都女娃儿” → points to **RL3**, emphasizing being born and raised locally.
  - “一点口音都没有” → relates to **RL4**, as accent is a linguistic-cultural marker.
  - “被烧” (implying being targeted or excluded) for lacking a local accent → suggests that **RL4** is a **resisted** criterion, not one the author endorses.
  - Emotional closeness to Chengdu despite lacking a local accent → implies a **critique of RL4** as a defining standard.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3** (""土生土长"") serves as the **core positive standard** the author uses to affirm her own local identity. It is central to her argument that she *is* a local, regardless of linguistic traits.
  - **RL4** (accent and dialect) is referenced as a **standard used by others**, but the author **resists or critiques** it by showing that its absence does not negate local identity.
  - The author’s emotional attachment to Chengdu is used to **reinforce the legitimacy of RL3** and challenge the validity of RL4.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL3** is **explicitly endorsed** by the author as a legitimate basis for defining local identity.
  - **RL4** is mentioned, but as a **critiqued or resisted standard**, not one the author herself uses.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly identifies with the logic of **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, using the idea of being ""born and raised here"" to assert her local identity.
  - She implicitly **rejects RL4**, showing that accent is not a necessary or sufficient condition for being a local.
  - Therefore, only **RL3** is endorsed and functionally used to define ""local identity"" in the text.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3"
反正我三环外的不是成都人,"**  
RL1"," The author is making a strong, identity-based assertion: ""Anyone not living inside the 3rd ring road is not a real Chengdu native."" This reflects a clear boundary the author uses to define who counts as a ""local"" — not based on administrative boundaries, family history, or culture, but based on **geographical proximity to the urban core**, which carries symbolic weight in local identity perception.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is ""三环外的不是成都人"" — ""not a Chengdu person if outside the 3rd ring road.""
  This implies a **symbolic boundary** of local identity tied to a mental map or socially accepted perception of where ""real locals"" live.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  The phrase functions as a **cognitive boundary marker** used by the author to **exclude** certain people from being considered ""real Chengdu locals"". It reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**, not a legal, cultural, or economic one. The author is not describing administrative facts or personal experience but is **endorsing a mental map** that defines localness.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is clearly using a **symbolic spatial boundary** (the 3rd ring road) as a **criterion to judge local identity**, not just describing it. This aligns with **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  The statement fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a **symbolic spatial logic** the author uses to define who is or is not a ""local"".

**Output:**  
RL1"
我同学说二环外的都是农民,RL1," * The author is reporting a statement made by a classmate: ""Everyone outside the Second Ring Road are peasants."" This statement is not the author's own belief, but rather something the classmate said. The author seems to be sharing this as an observation or anecdote, possibly to highlight a social perception or stereotype.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key element is the **spatial boundary** (""二环外的"" — outside the Second Ring Road) being linked with a **social identity** (""农民"" — peasants).
  * This implies a **spatial-based social hierarchy** where people are judged by which part of the city they live in.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""二环外的都是农民"" functions as a **reported viewpoint**, not the author’s own belief.
  * It reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** logic — using a spatial boundary to define who is considered ""local"" or ""non-local"", or who belongs to a certain social group.
  * The author is not endorsing this logic, but rather **reporting or reflecting on** the fact that such a perception exists.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not explicitly endorsing the viewpoint, only reporting it.
  * However, the act of mentioning this statement implies that the author is **aware of and possibly commenting on** the existence of such a **socially conventional territorial logic**.
  * Since the statement is used to illustrate how people define ""local identity"" based on **territorial perception**, it can be interpreted as **implicitly conveying** that such a logic is part of the discourse around local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The key RL category is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the statement uses a spatial boundary to define or categorize people's identity, reflecting a **socially conventional mental map** that distinguishes between areas and the people who live in them.
  * Other RL categories (like RL2, RL3, etc.) are not referenced or implied in the text.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
歧视三环外的多，还是学生偏多,RL1," *   The author is posing a rhetorical question, pointing out that there is a prevalent **bias or discrimination against people from outside the Third Ring Road** (""歧视三环外的多"") and implying that this bias is particularly evident among a specific group — likely students (""还是学生偏多"").
  *   The core expressive intent is to **highlight and critique the existence of regional discrimination**, particularly in how ""local identity"" is judged, and to **question or expose the mindset behind such discrimination**, possibly suggesting it's common among students or youth.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road): This is a **symbolic spatial boundary**, possibly indicating a **mentally mapped or socially recognized division** of the city.
  *   ""歧视"" (discrimination): Implies a **social boundary or exclusion mechanism** based on regional identity.
  *   ""学生偏多"" (students are more biased): Suggests that **a certain demographic (students) are more likely to hold or express this bias**, which reflects an **implicit endorsement or observation of social attitudes**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""三环外"" functions as a **symbolic spatial boundary** used by some to distinguish ""local"" from ""non-local"", which reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity**.
  *   The mention of ""discrimination"" implies that the author **critiques or observes this boundary-making behavior**, but the fact that they bring it up as a point of discussion also shows they **acknowledge its existence and relevance in how people define ""local""**.
  *   The mention of students as the main discriminators is more about **identifying a demographic tendency** rather than directly defining ""local identity"", though it indirectly **validates the existence of the boundary and its social function**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not explicitly endorse** the boundary between inside/outside the Third Ring Road as a valid criterion for defining ""local"", but they **acknowledge its existence and social function**, which is sufficient for RL1 annotation.
  *   The author **does not endorse** the idea that students are more biased — rather, they **observe or critique it**, so this part does **not qualify as a criterion the author uses to define ""local""**.
  *   No other RL categories (e.g., administrative, rootedness, cultural, etc.) are mentioned or implied.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's rhetorical question reflects an **awareness and critique of socially conventional territorial identity**, where ""inside/outside the Third Ring Road"" is a **symbolically recognized boundary** for local identity.
  *   This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is pointing out how this spatial boundary is used in social cognition to define who is considered ""local"" or not.

RL1, RL2, RL3, RL6"," The author is describing the strong sense of superiority held by native Chengdu residents (""成都土著""), emphasizing that they define themselves through a sense of **pure lineage or long-standing local roots**. They also **establish a hierarchy of local identity**, where not just anyone — not even all locals — are considered truly ""local"" or worthy of respect. The text implies a **symbolic ranking** based on **origin, generational rootedness**, and even **educational or social status markers**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **“土著”**, **“土生土长”** → Suggests **long-standing family or personal rootedness in Chengdu**, pointing to **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**
  - **“5城区成都人”** → Implies a **territorial identity** based on traditional or conventional understanding of central Chengdu, pointing to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
  - **“三环外”**, **“弯脚杆”**, **“211”**, **“成都省护照”** → These are **identity labels used to differentiate degrees of localness**, especially through **educational status**, **regional origin within Chengdu**, and **symbolic documents or identities** (like a metaphorical passport). This points to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** (via status symbols and social hierarchy) and possibly **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** (via ""passport"" as a proxy for official status or recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3** is used to justify the **""pure bloodline"" identity** of the ""土著"", which is the **core basis of their superiority**.
  - **RL1** reinforces this by **limiting the scope of who counts as truly local** — only those from the central 5 districts.
  - **RL2** is **metaphorical**, used to show **who is officially or symbolically accepted as part of the ""local"" group**.
  - **RL6** supports the **hierarchical ranking of local identity**, where even within the broader Chengdu area, certain people are seen as lower status and thus **eligible to be looked down upon**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** any of these criteria — instead, they **describe and imply acceptance of** a system where:
    - Being **born and raised in Chengdu’s core districts** (RL1, RL3) makes one a true local.
    - Having a **symbolic or administrative identity** (e.g., “成都省护照”) (RL2) is a **new but accepted form of local legitimacy**.
    - Social hierarchy (RL6) is **clearly acknowledged and used to define local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **""local identity"" in Chengdu is defined through a mix of traditional rootedness**, **territorial perception**, **symbolic documents**, and **social hierarchy**.
  - The **""土著"" identity is rooted in generational history (RL3)** and **central Chengdu identity (RL1)**.
  - The **""new locals""** are those who have **gained symbolic legitimacy (RL2)** and **entered the local hierarchy (RL6)**.

**Output:**

成华区二环内土著 几十年了没觉得啥子,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a personal sense of rootedness and long-term belonging in the Chenghua District within the 2nd Ring Road, emphasizing that this identity has been stable for decades. The phrase ""土著"" (native) clearly signals a self-identification as a long-standing local, while ""几十年了没觉得啥子"" (after decades, haven’t felt anything) suggests a calm, normalized attitude toward this identity, possibly resisting external notions that this identity should be questioned or changed.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成华区二环内"" (within the 2nd Ring Road in Chenghua District): This is a **geographical marker** that may reflect a conventional territorial identity (RL1).
  - ""土著"" (native): This implies a **self-identification as a long-standing local**, possibly rooted in generational or lifelong presence, suggesting RL3.
  - The **time frame** ""几十年了"" (for decades): This reinforces the idea of long-term presence, supporting RL3.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""成华区二环内"" functions to **anchor the author's local identity** in a specific area that is culturally and socially recognized as part of the traditional Chengdu urban core. This supports the idea of a conventional territorial identity (RL1).
  - ""土著"" and ""几十年了"" together **establish the author's rootedness**, suggesting that they are a “purebred local” based on long-term presence and possibly generational continuity (RL3).
  - The overall tone implies that this identity is **stable and unchallenged**, and the author **does not feel the need to defend or explain it**, indicating that they **endorse** these criteria as sufficient for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL1 is clearly endorsed through the use of a **specific, socially recognized geographical boundary** to define local identity.
  - RL3 is clearly endorsed through the use of **long-term presence and self-identification as “native”** to define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implicitly defines ""local"" through **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they anchor their identity in a specific, culturally recognized area within Chengdu.
  - The author also defines ""local"" through **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as they emphasize long-term presence and self-identify as a “native,” implying generational or lifelong local status.

They express a mild discomfort with certain accents — a cultural-linguistic marker — but also emphasize that there's no major issue, and that many local Chengdu people are also ""撇火药"" (cool, easygoing). The core intent is to affirm their local identity and a nuanced view of linguistic acceptance within the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “我是成都土著” — suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
- “受不了一些口音” — suggests **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The statement “我是成都土著” functions as a **self-identification** with a long-standing local identity, implying that being born and raised in Chengdu is a key part of being considered a ""local person"". This supports **RL3**.
- The mention of being “受不了一些口音” (not quite accepting of some accents) indicates that **linguistic features** play a role in how the author perceives local identity, even if it's not a major issue. This supports **RL4**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- Both RL3 and RL4 are **endorsed or at least acknowledged by the author as relevant to defining local identity**. The author uses them to frame their own identity and their perception of others in the local community.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL3** applies because the author identifies as a native Chengdu resident, implying that this is a meaningful basis for local identity.
- **RL4** applies because the author acknowledges linguistic differences (accents) as a criterion they notice, even if they don’t fully resist it.

RL1"," The text is a rhetorical question in a regional dialect, likely Sichuanese or Chongqing dialect, and translates roughly to: ""How can someone from outside the Third Ring Road (a peripheral area) dare to look down on others?"" The author is challenging the legitimacy of people from certain areas (specifically, ""outside the Third Ring Road"") in looking down on others, implying a critique of spatial-based social hierarchy or identity judgment. The core expressive intent is that **people from certain geographical zones (here, the periphery) lack the legitimacy or standing to judge others as outsiders or locals**, which reveals the author's **implicit criteria for defining local identity**.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""三环外"" (""outside the Third Ring Road"") implies a **mental map or spatial cognition** about which areas are considered central or peripheral.
  - The rhetorical tone suggests a **social ranking logic** where spatial location is used as a **basis for judging local identity or social legitimacy**.
  - No explicit mention of administrative boundaries, hukou, family history, language, economic status, or occupation.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""三环外"" functions as a **symbolic boundary** that the author implicitly uses to question the **legitimacy of certain people in claiming local identity or superiority**.
  - The author **does not endorse** the idea of judging people based on this spatial boundary, but the **existence and social use of this boundary** are acknowledged.
  - The author is **resisting the idea** that someone from the periphery has the right to judge others, implying that **""localness"" is tied to centrality or core area identity**.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the boundary logic but critiques its misuse.
  - However, the **existence of such a spatial boundary** is **implicitly accepted as part of the social discourse** used to define local identity.
  - The author’s **core argument is that such boundaries are misused**, but they are still part of the **socially conventional territorial identity logic**.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The logic used is that **people from certain areas (core vs. periphery)** are socially ranked, and this is **used to judge identity legitimacy**.
  - This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, which involves **socially accepted spatial boundaries or mental maps** used to define local identity or social hierarchy.

本土著去年底刚从市中心搬到天府新区 只能说三环内土著不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人,"** RL1, RL3, RL6"," The author is expressing a viewpoint about how local identity is perceived and socially ranked within the city. The key assertion is that being a ""本土著"" (native local) in Chengdu, specifically someone who has lived in the inner city (""三环内""), does not necessarily mean one is free of discriminatory attitudes — instead, such locals may discriminate against people from other parts of the same city, such as those living in Tianfu New Area (""三环外""). This implies a **hierarchical perception of local identity based on spatial location within the city**, not just between locals and outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""本土著"" (native local): This suggests a rootedness or generational presence in a place.
  - ""去年底刚从市中心搬到天府新区"" (moved from the city center to Tianfu New Area at the end of last year): This indicates a change in residential location, and by implication, a shift in perceived local identity.
  - ""三环内土著"" (native of within the 3rd ring road): This implies a socially accepted distinction between ""core locals"" and others.
  - ""歧视三环外人"" (discriminate against people outside the 3rd ring road): This shows a **symbolic boundary** between different parts of the city, based on location.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""本土著"" and ""三环内土著"" are used to highlight a **core local identity** based on historical rootedness in the traditional urban core.
  - The act of moving to ""天府新区"" (Tianfu New Area, outside the 3rd ring road) is framed as a shift that changes one’s status — suggesting that **local identity is not static or purely rooted in birth, but is also shaped by spatial location and social perception**.
  - The claim that ""三环内土著不歧视外地人但歧视三环外人"" implies that **local identity boundaries are not about nativeness per se, but about where one lives now** — a socially constructed boundary within the city itself.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is not merely describing an administrative or cultural boundary — they are critiquing a **socially constructed hierarchy** of localness based on **geographical location within the city**.
  - The key criteria being endorsed are:
    - **Spatial location within the city** (e.g., 三环内 vs. 三环外) as a marker of local identity.
    - **Socially accepted distinctions** between different urban zones, which influence how one is perceived or treated.
    - **Identity boundaries** that are **not based on hukou, dialect, or cultural habits**, but on **perceived centrality within the city**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author implies that there is a **socially accepted mental map** that distinguishes between the core city (三环内) and the periphery (三环外), and that this distinction affects how localness is perceived and evaluated.
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — While the author moved recently, the emphasis on being a ""土著"" implies that **historical rootedness or long-term presence in a specific area (the core city)** contributes to being seen as a ""true local"".
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** — The discrimination against ""三环外人"" suggests that **social capital and perceived status** are tied to location, and that living in the core area is associated with a more authentic or superior local identity.

听过同事吐槽，她老公是二环的，她家在二环也有房子，但是户口是青白江的，然后她老公的亲戚摆龙门阵就一口一个你们乡坝头咋个咋个,RL2," The author is describing a situation where a colleague's husband's relatives mock her for having a **hukou (household registration)** in Qingbaijiang, despite the couple owning property and living in the Second Ring Road area. The relatives use this as a basis to **exclude her from being considered a ""local""**, implying that **hukou affiliation is an important criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **""户口是青白江的"" (hukou is from Qingbaijiang)** — clearly relates to administrative affiliation.
  - The relatives’ mockery is based on **hukou as a marker of local identity**, not on residence or property ownership.
  - The contrast between **residential location (Second Ring Road)** and **hukou (Qingbaijiang)** highlights the **functional role of administrative legitimacy** in defining who is considered ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **hukou** is not just described as a fact, but is **explicitly used by the husband's relatives as a standard to mock and socially exclude** the woman.
  - The author is **highlighting how hukou is socially accepted and used as a criterion** to judge whether someone is ""local"", even when other factors (like place of residence or property ownership) might suggest otherwise.
  - The author does not explicitly oppose or resist this logic; they **present it as the standard used by others**, and the **tone suggests it is a commonly accepted or influential view**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not personally endorse** the use of hukou as a standard, but they **clearly convey that it is a criterion used by others in defining local identity**.
  - However, the **core argument is not about opposing it**, but about **illustrating how it functions in social discourse to define ""local""**.
  - Since the author **implicitly conveys that this criterion is used and accepted by some people to define local identity**, it qualifies for annotation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The key criterion used is **hukou affiliation**, which falls under **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - The relatives use **hukou as a basis for judging local identity**, which aligns with the RL2 definition: defining ""local people"" based on **household registration affiliation**.
  - The author does not resist this logic but **presents it as a functional standard in social discourse**, hence it is **implicitly endorsed in the context of how people define ""local""**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL2"
三环边边 不敢说是土著 走到一环二环都说进城 不敢开车 怕遭说,** RL1," The author is expressing a sense of **not belonging to the inner city** (一环二环) and feeling like an outsider when entering those areas. The phrase ""不敢说是土著"" indicates that the author does not feel like a ""true local"" or native, and the phrase ""怕遭说"" implies that there is a **social judgment or expectation** tied to being a local. The author is conveying that **people from outside the inner city (e.g.,三环) are judged when entering inner city areas**, suggesting a **socially accepted hierarchy or boundary** between areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""三环"" (third ring road) vs. ""一环二环"" (first and second ring roads): This is a **spatial distinction** that reflects a **mental map or socially accepted boundary**.
- ""不敢说是土著"" (afraid to say I’m a native/local): This reflects **identity insecurity** tied to **geographical origin**.
- ""走到一环二环都说进城"" (when I go to the first or second ring, people say I’m ""entering the city""): This suggests a **socially conventional understanding of what counts as the ""real city"" or ""core local area""**.
- ""不敢开车，怕遭说"" (afraid to drive because of what people might say): This implies **social judgment based on perceived status or identity**, likely tied to **territorial identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The **distinction between 三环 and 一环/二环** plays a **central role** in the author’s expression of **not being considered a ""true local""**.
- The **mental map of urban areas** and the **social judgment associated with it** are **not resisted** by the author but are **implicitly accepted** as **valid criteria for defining local identity**.
- The author’s **fear of being judged** (""怕遭说"") reinforces that **these spatial boundaries are socially meaningful** and used to **differentiate insiders from outsiders**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **implicitly accepts** the idea that **people from 三环 are not considered ""real locals""** and **people from 一环/二环 are**.
- This reflects a **socially conventional understanding of local identity based on spatial hierarchy**, which is **not resisted** but rather **used to express the author’s self-perception**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** category fits because the author **implicitly accepts and conveys a socially conventional mental map** where **certain areas (一环/二环) are seen as the ""real city"" or ""core local area""**, and **others (三环) are not**.
- There is **no clear evidence** that the author uses **administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or occupation** to define local identity.

**Output:** RL1"
我还挺喜欢成都口音的,RL4," The author expresses a personal liking for the Chengdu accent, implying a positive emotional association with it.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key element here is the mention of a **local accent**, which is directly related to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of the Chengdu accent plays a **positive evaluative role**, suggesting that the accent is a valued or appreciated feature of local identity. While the sentence is brief, it implies that **accent** is a meaningful marker of local identity in the author's view.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **implicitly conveys** that accent (a cultural-linguistic feature) is relevant to their perception of local identity, indicating that they **endorse** it as a meaningful characteristic.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The sentence fits the RL4 category: the author's liking of the Chengdu accent suggests that **linguistic features** are part of their perception of what constitutes or represents ""local"" identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

三环外不配，而且可能还同时被外地人歧视,** RL1," *   The author is expressing a critical viewpoint about how certain areas (specifically ""outside the Third Ring Road"") are not considered part of the ""real"" or ""core"" local area. There is also a strong implication that people from these areas may face discrimination from outsiders, reinforcing a sense of social or spatial hierarchy. The key expressive intent is to define **which areas are excluded from being considered ""local""** based on **socially conventional spatial cognition**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""三环外"" (""outside the Third Ring Road"") — a **spatial boundary** that is used to demarcate who or what areas are not considered ""local"".
  *   ""不配"" (""not worthy"") — evaluative language that frames the area outside the Third Ring Road as **symbolically inferior** in the local identity system.
  *   ""被外地人歧视"" (""discriminated by outsiders"") — implies a **social boundary** and **identity-based exclusion**, reinforcing that people from this area are not considered part of the ""true"" local group.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""三环外"" functions as a **symbolic boundary** in the author's mental map of the city — it marks a space that is **not recognized as part of the legitimate local core**.
  *   The use of ""不配"" indicates that the author sees this spatial boundary as **socially significant** and tied to **status evaluation**.
  *   The mention of discrimination by outsiders reinforces the **social segregation logic** — people from outside the Third Ring Road are not only spatially but also **socially excluded** from being considered ""true locals"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that being ""outside the Third Ring Road"" is a marker of **spatial identity exclusion**.
  *   This is not just a physical boundary but a **symbolically loaded one**, tied to **social evaluation** and **identity legitimacy**.
  *   The author **does not resist** this boundary — they **accept and reinforce** it, using it to define who is not considered local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
      *   The author implicitly accepts and promotes a **socially conventional spatial boundary** (Third Ring Road) that defines **who or what areas are considered ""local"" or not**.
      *   The boundary is not administrative or legal, but **symbolic and socially sedimented**, used to demarcate **identity affiliation and cognitive difference**.
      *   The author uses this boundary to **exclude** certain areas and people from the ""local"" category and to frame them as socially inferior or marginalized.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Despite not personally feeling superior as a ""local"" (一环路土著), they observe a social phenomenon where people from other parts of Sichuan may be perceived as trying to claim local status, and where speaking the local dialect (成都话) can even be met with suspicion or accusation of pretense. This reflects an underlying tension around what constitutes being a ""real local"" and how language is used as a symbolic boundary.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""一环路穷土著"" — implies a sense of rootedness and local identity, possibly RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness) and RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  - ""四川其他地方的朋友"" — indicates a contrast between Chengdu locals and people from other parts of Sichuan, suggesting territorial boundary-making (RL1).
  - ""成都朋友在外面说个成都话，都会被不知情的人指责她学成都口音装成都人"" — clearly points to language and accent as a marker of local identity, which maps to RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly acknowledges the existence of a perceived hierarchy between ""Chengdu locals"" and people from other parts of Sichuan. This hierarchy is not based on legal or administrative boundaries but on socially conventional distinctions, which are used to define who counts as ""local"" or not.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** While the phrase ""一环路穷土著"" may imply a long-standing personal or family connection to the area, the author does not assert this as a criterion for being considered local. Rather, it is a self-deprecating way to describe their own identity, not a standard they use to judge others.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author highlights that speaking the Chengdu dialect (成都话) is a key cultural marker. The fact that someone is accused of ""pretending"" to be from Chengdu just by speaking the dialect indicates that language is a central, if contested, criterion for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not explicitly endorse RL3 as a defining criterion. Instead, they seem to downplay their own rootedness (""穷土著"") and do not use it to assert superiority.
  - The author clearly highlights **RL1** (the social perception that some people from other parts of Sichuan may be seen as outsiders trying to pass as locals) and **RL4** (the use of Chengdu dialect as a marker of local identity that can be both a sign of belonging and a source of exclusion).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is not defining local identity based on administrative boundaries or economic status but is instead reflecting on how **socially conventional territorial identities** (RL1) and **linguistic markers** (RL4) are used in everyday interactions to include or exclude people from the ""local"" category. This reflects a nuanced understanding of how symbolic boundaries are constructed and contested.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL1, RL4"
其实和成都土著关系不大，还是看个人素质，在成都呆了10多年，大部分成都土著还是很好的，以前嘿多成都嬢嬢经常给我介绍对象,N/A," * The author is expressing that being a ""local"" in成都 (Chengdu) is not necessarily defined by being a native or long-term resident (""和成都土著关系不大""), but rather by personal qualities (""还是看个人素质""). They also share a personal experience indicating that many native Chengdu women (""成都嬢嬢"") have been friendly and even helpful in their personal life (e.g., setting them up on dates).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""成都土著"" — potentially relates to **RL3** (family rootedness or growth history in the area).
  * ""在成都呆了10多年"" — potentially relates to **RL3** (individual growth history or long-term residence).
  * ""还是看个人素质"" — indicates a **rejection** of conventional criteria and proposes personal qualities as a more important standard for judging people, though not part of the RL framework.
  * ""成都嬢嬢经常给我介绍对象"" — indicates social integration and acceptance by locals, possibly linking to **RL6** (social roots or connections), but in a personal and anecdotal way.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is **rejecting** the idea that being a ""local"" (土著) is the key to social integration or being considered a true local. They imply that long-term residence or native status are **not sufficient or necessary** conditions to define local identity or to be accepted socially.
  * The mention of being in Chengdu for over 10 years and being accepted by locals (e.g., being set up on dates) suggests that **personal qualities and social integration** matter more than conventional markers of local identity.
  * The author does **not endorse** any specific RL category as a standard for defining ""local identity"". Instead, they **resist** RL3 and RL6-style definitions and propose a more subjective, personal-quality-based standard.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not endorse** any of the RL categories as valid criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  * They **resist** the idea that being a native (RL3) or having deep social roots (RL6) is what makes someone a local.
  * They suggest that **personal qualities and social integration** are more important, but this is not one of the RL categories.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * No RL categories are endorsed by the author.
  * The text **resists** RL3 and **implicitly resists** RL6.
  * The author proposes a **non-standard, subjective** view of local identity based on personal qualities and social acceptance, which falls outside the RL framework.

**Step 6: Output Result**

怎么说呢，我老家是成都郊区的，跟父母常年住在成都的，每次别人问我，我都说我是某郊区人别人都会说：成都人哦！感觉阴阳怪气的,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a sense of discomfort or mislabeling when others assume they are a ""Chengdu person"" just because they live in Chengdu with their parents, despite being originally from the suburbs. There's a subtle distinction being made between being from the city core vs. the suburbs, and how others **socially categorize** them despite their actual background.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""我老家是成都郊区的"" (My hometown is in the suburbs of Chengdu) → potentially RL3 (family historical rootedness) and RL1 (territorial identity).
  - ""跟父母常年住在成都的"" (I've lived in Chengdu with my parents for years) → potentially RL3 (growth history), RL1 (residential-based identity), or RL6 (social integration).
  - ""别人都会说：成都人哦！"" (Others say: You're a Chengdu person!) → implies a **socially conventional identity attribution**, possibly RL1.
  - ""感觉阴阳怪气的"" (Feels sarcastic or condescending) → emotional reaction to being mislabeled, reinforces the idea that the speaker **feels excluded** from the ""true local"" label.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The author emphasizes their **family origin** and **early life in the suburbs**, indicating that this is central to how they define their own local identity (RL3).
  - The **contrast between suburban origin and urban residence** is key to the author’s discomfort — others assume urban identity based on current residence, which the author resists.
  - The **social labeling by others** (""成都人哦！"") is described as sarcastic, suggesting that the author perceives a **socially conventional boundary** (RL1) being imposed, which they do not认同认同 (认同 →认同).
  - There is **no mention of administrative identity, language, economic status, or environmental quality**, so those categories are not relevant.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **identifies with their suburban roots** and resists being labeled as a ""core Chengdu person"" due to their **family history and early life location** → RL3.
  - The author also **implicitly critiques the conventional social assumption** that living in Chengdu makes one a ""Chengdu person"", highlighting a **socially conventional boundary** that they do not endorse → RL1.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is directly supported by the author’s emphasis on family origin and upbringing.
  - **RL1** is supported by the author’s resistance to socially conventional labeling and the implied distinction between suburban and urban Chengdu identities.

不知道 但是知道土著一直在被其他人嘲讽口音 不知道有什么好笑的 特别是那个电炒饭...,"** RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing a critical attitude toward the mockery of local people's accents and cultural symbols (like ""dian chaofan"" – stir-fried rice with an electric cooker), which are implicitly portrayed as elements of local identity. The tone suggests that the author sees this mockery as unjust or ignorant, and by implication, the author endorses the idea that these features (accent and cultural habits) are meaningful markers of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土著"" (indigenous/local people)
  - ""嘲讽口音"" (mocking accents) – relates to language and accent
  - ""电炒饭"" (stir-fried rice using an electric cooker) – a cultural or lifestyle habit associated with locals

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The mention of accent mockery implies that **accent is a criterion used to identify locals**, and that this criterion is being used in a discriminatory way.
  - The mention of ""电炒饭"" implies that **local cultural habits or lifestyle traits** are being used as symbols to distinguish locals from others, and are being ridiculed.
  - The author's tone suggests they **implicitly endorse** the legitimacy of these traits as part of local identity, even as they are being mocked.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that **accent and cultural habits** are criteria used to judge or distinguish ""local people"".
  - These are not criteria the author opposes; rather, the author critiques how they are used by others to mock locals, thereby **endorsing their relevance** to local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – because the author discusses accent and cultural habits (like ""电炒饭"") as traits associated with local people and used for identification.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – the term ""土著"" implies a conventional understanding of who the ""true locals"" are, based on long-standing territorial and cultural belonging.

RL1, RL4"," The author is pushing back against the idea that **local Chengdu residents (成都人)** are discriminatory or superior. Instead, they argue that **outsiders (外地人)** often hold prejudices against Chengdu locals, assuming they are wealthy or privileged based on their local identity. The author also implies that Chengdu locals are often economically disadvantaged and face misunderstanding or unfair judgment. Additionally, the author identifies themselves as a local from the second ring road (二环), and mentions the local linguistic habit of saying ""进城"" (go into the city) when going to a central area like Chunxi Road, indicating a **linguistic and territorial self-identification**.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “成都人” (Chengdu people) — implies local identity.
- “外地人比较歧视和排挤成都人” — suggests the author is responding to external judgments of locals, implying a definition of local identity shaped by **outsider perception**.
- “你们屋头有几套房？” — outsiders judge locals based on **property ownership**, but the author resists this as a criterion.
- “我们成都的有几个买的起房给得起彩礼嘛” — again, economic criteria are discussed, but the author **rejects them** as standards for being a ""true local"".
- “我二环的” — locates the speaker within a specific urban geography, implying a **socially conventional territorial identity**.
- “我们去春熙路一般都说进城” — reflects a **cultural-linguistic habit** of identifying Chunxi Road as the ""city center"", indicating local awareness.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The **economic references** (RL5 and RL6) are **not criteria the author uses to define local identity**; rather, they are **criteria that outsiders wrongly apply** to locals, which the author **rejects**.
- The **linguistic behavior** (""进城"") and **geographical self-positioning** (""我二环的"") are used by the author to **illustrate their authentic local identity**, not to judge others. These are **endorsed** by the author as markers of being local.
- The author is **defending local identity** against misrepresentation and stereotyping, emphasizing **how locals perceive themselves**, not how others judge them.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author locates themselves as “二环的” and uses “进城” to describe going to Chunxi Road — both reflect a **mentally mapped, socially conventional understanding of local geography**.
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The phrase “我们去春熙路一般都说进城” shows **linguistic behavior** that reflects local identity and is **endorsed by the author** as a feature of being local.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
The author defines local identity not through economic or administrative means, but through **cultural-linguistic practices** and **socially conventional territorial self-positioning**. The author is asserting that being a local is about **how one talks and where one locates oneself in the city’s mental geography**, not about wealth or property.

不知道什么时候开始我们老成都人就开始被人骂看不起人了，大多是普通家庭的老成都谁管你哪来的，为什么说成都包容度大就是不管别人的事啊，归属感不强不融入当地不是本地人的错,"RL3, RL4, RL6"," The author is defending the image of ""老成都人"" (long-time Chengdu residents) against accusations of being snobbish or discriminatory. They argue that most long-time Chengdu residents come from ordinary families and do not care where newcomers come from. The author attributes the perceived lack of integration or belonging among newcomers not to the locals, but to the newcomers themselves not making the effort to融入 (integrate into) the local community. The author implies that the identity of being a ""local"" should be based on actual integration and belonging, not just presence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老成都人"" — implies a long-standing local identity rooted in generational presence (RL3).
  - ""归属感不强不融入当地"" — suggests that integration and sense of belonging are criteria for being considered a local (RL4: cultural-linguistic and social integration; RL6: depth of social roots).
  - Implicit contrast between ""老成都"" and ""别人"" (others) — suggests a boundary of local identity (RL1: conventional territorial identity).
  - No mention of administrative boundaries, occupation, or economic status.

**Step 3: Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""老成都人"" functions as a marker of authentic local identity based on historical rootedness (RL3).
  - ""归属感不强不融入当地"" functions as a counter-argument: the author is not blaming locals for exclusion, but rather suggesting that some newcomers haven’t truly integrated, which is why they don’t feel local (RL4 and RL6).
  - The contrast between ""老成都"" and ""别人"" reinforces a sense of insider/outsider boundary (RL1), though this is not the author’s main point but rather an implied background understanding.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** as the basis for authentic local identity.
  - The author also implies that **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** and **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots)** are important for integration and thus for being considered a true local.
  - There is no endorsement of RL2 (administrative legitimacy), RL5 (livability), or RL7 (occupational symbolism).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is clearly implied through the use of ""老成都人"", suggesting that long-term family presence defines true locals.
  - **RL4** is implied through the author’s view that lack of integration (not speaking the language, not understanding local customs) is why some people don’t feel accepted as locals.
  - **RL6** is implied through the author’s belief that belonging requires deeper social integration, not just physical presence.

**Step 6: Output Result**

锦江区二环攀成钢必须焊死在脑门上,RL1**," The phrase ""锦江区二环攀成钢必须焊死在脑门上"" (translated loosely as ""the area inside the second ring road of Jinjiang District, Pan Cheng Gang must be branded on one's forehead"") conveys a strong assertion about the symbolic importance of a specific geographical area within Chengdu. The author implies that living or belonging in this specific area (Pan Cheng Gang within Jinjiang District’s Second Ring Road) is a marker of authentic local identity — something so intrinsic that it's as if it's ""welded"" onto one’s identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The text emphasizes a **specific geographic area** (锦江区二环内攀成钢) as a symbol of local identity.
  - The use of ""焊死在脑门上"" (welded to the forehead) implies that this location is **symbolically inseparable** from one’s identity.
  - There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family history, language, or economic status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The geographic location is not just a place of residence but a **symbol of status and local authenticity**.
  - The author is not criticizing or resisting this idea — they are **endorsing** it as a standard or marker of being truly local.
  - The phrase implies a **socially accepted boundary** or elite zone within the city that defines the ""real locals.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is clearly using a **symbolic, socially conventional territorial identity** to define who is considered a true local.
  - There is no evidence that the author uses administrative status, cultural-linguistic traits, family history, or economic assets to make this argument.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is reinforcing a **symbolic and socially accepted boundary** (Jinjiang District’s inner second ring road, Pan Cheng Gang) as the core area that defines authentic local identity.
  - The phrase ""welded to the forehead"" suggests that this identity is **deeply internalized or socially imposed**, aligning with the idea of **mental maps** and **symbolic regional cognition**.

RL3, RL4"," The author is defending the identity and dignity of ""real Chengdu people,"" arguing that outsiders (implied to be non-locals) often provoke hostility by insulting Chengdu’s culture, environment, and speech. The author implies that it is this provocation — aimed at those who are genuinely local — that leads to the defensive or aggressive reactions sometimes labeled as ""弯脚杆"" (a derogatory term for Chengdu locals). Therefore, the author is redefining who the real ""locals"" are and what criteria they use to affirm their local identity in the face of external criticism.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **""说成都的面最难吃，成都二环内市区破烂，口音难听""** — implies cultural and linguistic characteristics used to target locals.
  - Reference to **“做人假打”** — a local behavioral stereotype, possibly cultural.
  - Emphasis on **“真的成都人”** — indicates a distinction between authentic and inauthentic locals.
  - Implied contrast between **""外地人"" (non-locals)** and **""真的成都人"" (real Chengdu people)** — suggesting a boundary of local identity.
  - The term **“外地人歧视” (discrimination by outsiders)** — implies that the real locals are those who feel the impact of this discrimination, suggesting a shared cultural or social experience.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The insults (about food, environment, accent) are used to show that cultural and linguistic features are criteria used by outsiders to judge locals, which the author resists.
  - The term “真的成都人” functions as a **positive identification** of authentic locals who are subject to this discrimination.
  - The author **rejects the outsider’s criteria** for judging locals (e.g., food quality, city appearance, accent), but **implicitly affirms an alternative basis** for identifying who is truly local — those who are targeted by these insults and who feel a shared sense of identity and grievance.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the criteria of food, city infrastructure, or accent as valid ways to judge localness — these are **resisted criteria**.
  - Instead, the author implies that **cultural-linguistic experience and shared identity** — being targeted for being from Chengdu — is a key part of being a real local.
  - The author also implies that **being born or deeply rooted in Chengdu** (as opposed to being a transient outsider) leads to being targeted — suggesting a **historical or rooted identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author implies that the insults are based on cultural and linguistic traits (food, accent), and that real locals are those who are identified and targeted based on these traits.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author distinguishes between “real Chengdu people” and “outsiders,” suggesting that only those with deep roots or long-term local identity are subject to this discrimination.

This reflects an **implicit boundary** the author uses to define who is considered a ""local"" in Chengdu.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""三环外甚至都不会说自己是成都人"" → Refers to a **geographical boundary (Third Ring Road)** being used to self-identify or not identify as a Chengdu local.
  - ""成都土著一般指的中心城区吧"" → Defines ""Chengdu native"" as someone from the **central urban area**, implying a **mental map or socially accepted boundary** of ""localness"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **geographical boundary (Third Ring Road)** functions as a **symbolic cutoff** the author uses to determine whether they personally qualify as ""local"".
  - The **central urban area** is positioned as the **core zone** of local identity, which the author implicitly accepts or conveys as the **socially conventional understanding**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** or negate these criteria; rather, they **implicitly endorse** the idea that **local identity** is defined by **geographical centrality** and **socially conventional mental maps**.
  - These are **explicitly used to define ""local people""** (成都土著) and distinguish insiders from outsiders.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

因为我们二环的一般没事不进城，就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩,RL1," The author is expressing a behavioral and possibly identity-based distinction between ""us"" (residents of the second ring road or beyond) and ""the city center"" (inner city or downtown). The phrase “没事不进城” (“we don’t go downtown unless necessary”) implies a sense of separation or boundary in daily activity space, possibly reflecting a self-identified local identity that is distinct from the urban core. The phrase “就在我们这个偏僻的地方玩” (“we just hang out in our out-of-the-way place”) further reinforces a sense of localized belonging and possibly a mental map that separates “our place” from the more central or conventionally prestigious urban areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “二环” (Second Ring Road) suggests a **territorial boundary** often used in Chinese cities to denote different urban zones.
  - The phrase “偏僻的地方” (“remote/out-of-the-way place”) indicates a **mental map** or **regional cognition** that distinguishes the speaker’s area as peripheral.
  - The use of “我们” (“we”) implies a **group identity** tied to that location.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - “二环” functions as a **symbolic boundary** that separates “us” from “them” (those who live or go into the city center).
  - “偏僻的地方” is not just a physical description but a **value-laden expression** that reflects a self-positioning in the urban hierarchy — possibly implying a lesser status in the mainstream perception but also a sense of authenticity or rootedness in a distinct local space.
  - The entire sentence implies a **socially conventional territorial identity** — a shared understanding among locals about where the “real us” live and where the “center” (symbolically and functionally) begins.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** or negate the territorial distinction; rather, they **affirm it** through their language and implied behavior.
  - The distinction is **used to define a local identity** — “we” are the ones who live in this peripheral area and do not go into the city center unless necessary.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is constructing a **socially conventional mental map** that defines a local identity based on territorial affiliation — living beyond the Second Ring Road and identifying with that space.
  - This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a **shared regional cognition** used to distinguish local identity.

This is described as a generational cultural habit, more common among the older generation, and used humorously among younger people without malice.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""三环外"" (outside the 3rd ring road) – suggests a territorial boundary linked to identity.
  *   ""变口音"" (change in accent) – indicates linguistic difference.
  *   ""老一辈传下来的"" (passed down from the older generation) – implies historical rootedness or tradition.
  *   ""开玩笑"" (joking) – shows the cultural function of the term, not meant to exclude but to differentiate.
  *   ""年轻人还好"" (younger generation is fine) – indicates generational change in identity perception.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""三环外"" and ""变口音"" are used to explain the **basis of a local identity boundary** – the author implies that **linguistic and territorial differences** are used by locals (especially the older generation) to distinguish ""us"" from ""them"".
  *   The term ""弯脚杆"" is not just a joke but **symbolizes a cultural-linguistic boundary**, even if it's softened in modern usage.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not resist** the use of dialect and territorial boundary as identity markers – they **explain and contextualize** them as part of local culture.
  *   The **linguistic boundary (RL4)** and **territorial identity (RL1)** are clearly used to define ""local identity"" in the text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author uses the idea of ""三环外"" as a boundary marker to explain how locals mentally divide who is ""local"" and who is not.

This includes a spatial boundary (""areas beyond the Third Ring Road don’t count"") and a judgment based on household registration status (""agricultural to non-agricultural hukou"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “土著” (native/local) – suggests rootedness, possibly RL3.
  - “看不起外地的” (look down on outsiders) – implies identity boundary, possibly RL1 or RL4.
  - “三环外的都不行” (areas beyond the Third Ring Road don’t count) – defines spatial boundary, possibly RL1.
  - “农转非” (agricultural to non-agricultural hukou) – implies administrative identity, RL2.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - “土著” – used to describe a self-identified local group with social superiority, functioning as a marker of local identity (RL3).
  - “看不起外地的” – shows the social boundary and hierarchy upheld by the local group, reinforcing the idea of an in-group/out-group distinction (RL1).
  - “三环外的都不行” – reinforces a socially conventional spatial boundary that defines who is considered part of the authentic local group (RL1).
  - “农转非” – used by the author’s relatives to distinguish between “authentic” locals and those who have administratively transitioned, implying that hukou history matters in local identity evaluation (RL2).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Although the author is not personally endorsing the prejudice, she **implicitly conveys** that these criteria are used by the local group she belongs to (or is associated with) to define local identity.
  - These criteria are part of the **socially accepted standards** within the local group, and the author **does not reject** them—she presents them as facts of the local mindset.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The boundary of “areas beyond the Third Ring Road don’t count” reflects a socially accepted spatial boundary that defines authentic local identity.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The term “农转非” (agricultural to non-agricultural hukou) is used by locals to evaluate someone’s local authenticity, indicating an administrative-rooted logic in identity judgment.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The term “土著” implies a long-standing rootedness in the area, functioning as a basis for local superiority.

大邑不算，土著是一二三环内,RL1," *   The author is making a clear distinction about who counts as a ""local"" in Chengdu, implicitly defining ""local people"" as those originating from the central urban areas (一二三环内), and explicitly excluding people from the suburban county 大邑 (Dàyì).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""大邑不算"" – suggests exclusion based on geographic origin.
  *   ""土著"" – refers to native or indigenous locals, implying deep-rooted local identity.
  *   ""是一二三环内"" – refers to the inner city rings, suggesting a socially conventional territorial identity based on proximity to the urban core.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""大邑不算"" functions to **exclude** a certain geographic group from the category of ""local"".
  *   The phrase ""土著是一二三环内"" functions to **define** who counts as ""local"" based on a socially conventional understanding of urban spatial hierarchy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is clearly using a **socially conventional territorial identity** logic to define who counts as ""local"".
  *   No mention of administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, etc., is made.
  *   The focus is on **which area counts as ""core local""** and which doesn’t, based on shared urban perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the author is endorsing a commonly accepted mental map of the city where the inner rings (1st to 3rd ring roads) are seen as the authentic local core, and areas like Dàyì are not.
  *   The author is not describing others’ views or resisting this logic — they are clearly endorsing it.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
以前主要是大邑口音真的重，现在还好了吧现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著,RL4," The author is expressing a change in perception: previously, the strong *Daxi* (大邑) accent marked someone as distinctly local, but now, with more outsiders in Chengdu, local Chengdu natives are being discriminated against. The key idea is that **local identity used to be defined by accent (a cultural-linguistic marker), but now there is a reversal in status dynamics between locals and outsiders**, with the latter sometimes looking down on the former.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “大邑口音真的重” – Strong Daxi accent → **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
- “现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著” – Outsiders in Chengdu discriminate against native Chengdu residents → suggests a **shift in how local identity is valued or judged**, possibly involving **RL6** if tied to social status or symbolic hierarchy, but more directly tied to **RL4** since the prior marker of local identity (accent) is now a basis for discrimination.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The mention of accent plays a **central role** in defining what used to make someone clearly local.
- The discrimination by outsiders implies a **change in how local identity is socially valued**, suggesting that **linguistic markers (RL4)** are still significant but now carry negative connotations.
- There is **no explicit endorsement** of administrative, economic, or occupational criteria; the focus remains on **language as a marker of localness and social identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **linguistic identity (accent)** is a key criterion for defining who is local, even if it is now being stigmatized.
- There is **no endorsement of RL6 or RL2**, and no mention of territory, family history, or facilities.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author is pointing out that **linguistic features (RL4)** were once strong indicators of local identity and are now associated with discrimination by outsiders, suggesting that the author sees **language as a central axis of local identity**, even if it's being devalued.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL4"
我爷爷老家是大邑县那边的，但是现在我爷爷的全家亲戚都已经全部搬到成都来了，并且有可能是我们沟通交流确实比较少，我印象当中他们没有过说可能要回到祖籍地去探望一下之类的。然后到我爸爸这一代就已经开始说自己就是土生土长成都人了。,RL3," The author is describing a generational shift in identity perception within their family. While the grandfather's generation originally came from Deyi County, they have all relocated to Chengdu and show no strong attachment or intention to return to their ancestral hometown. The father's generation now identifies as native Chengdu residents. The author subtly implies that **local identity is shaped by long-term residence and generational adaptation**, rather than ancestral origin.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ancestral origin (大邑县) → potentially related to **RL3**.
  - Emphasis on relocation and generational shift → suggests a **change in identity basis** from family roots to local upbringing → **RL3**.
  - Claiming to be ""native Chengdu people"" based on upbringing → **RL3** and possibly **RL1** (territorial identity).
  - Lack of emotional or symbolic attachment to ancestral place → implies that **identity is not rooted in family history alone**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ancestral roots in Deyi County serves as a **contrast** to the current local identity. The author **does not endorse ancestral origin as the defining criterion**.
  - The shift in identity from ""from Deyi"" to ""native Chengdu person"" due to upbringing and generational change is **explicitly endorsed** by the author as a **valid or natural transition**, thus emphasizing **RL3**.
  - The self-identification as ""土生土长成都人"" (native Chengdu person) implies **territorial belonging based on upbringing**, which aligns with both **RL1** and **RL3**, but since the emphasis is on **birth and growth**, **RL3** is more dominant.
  - There is no mention of administrative status, language, or other criteria, so other RLs are not relevant.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **growing up in a place and generational continuity** as the basis for local identity.
  - The author implicitly rejects ancestral ties as a sufficient or necessary condition for defining local identity.
  - Therefore, only **RL3** is directly and clearly endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses the narrative of **family relocation and generational change** to argue that **local identity is rooted in where one was born and raised**, not in ancestral origin.
  - This fits the **RL3** category, which emphasizes **family historical rootedness or individual growth history** as the basis for local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3"
思想观念，口音，穿着品味,RL4," The text snippet lists three aspects: 思想观念 (values/thinking), 口音 (accent), and 穿着品味 (dress style). These are described as criteria that the author associates with defining or evaluating ""local identity"". The author implies that these are **symbolic markers** used to distinguish between locals and non-locals.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - 思想观念 (values/thinking) — potentially related to **RL4** (cultural-linguistic recognition) if it refers to local customs or social norms.
  - 口音 (accent) — clearly aligns with **RL4**, which includes linguistic markers such as accent and dialect.
  - 穿着品味 (dress style) — potentially related to **RL4** if it reflects local cultural habits or serves as a symbolic boundary for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These three elements are **presented as key indicators** of local identity. The author is suggesting that these are not just personal traits, but **symbolic markers** that distinguish who is considered ""local"" or not.
  - The author implies that these are **shared cultural and linguistic norms** that define the boundaries of local identity, and thus play a **definitional and evaluative role** in determining who belongs.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - All three elements are **endorsed by the author** as **valid and relevant criteria** for defining or evaluating local identity.
  - These are not described as external opinions or resisted views, but rather as **the author’s own basis** for distinguishing local from non-local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **口音 (accent)** directly maps to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it is a linguistic marker used to identify local identity.
  - **思想观念 (values/thinking)** and **穿着品味 (dress style)** can also be mapped to **RL4**, as they reflect **cultural habits and symbolic norms** that distinguish locals from outsiders.
  - These elements collectively support the author’s view that **local identity is defined by shared cultural and linguistic traits**, not just geography or legal status.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL4"
……如果北京上海土著来到成都也是外地人，是不是也歧视人家思想意识 口音 和穿着品味,RL1**," * The author is questioning the logic of discrimination against ""non-locals"" in Chengdu, implying that even natives of major cities like Beijing or Shanghai would be considered ""outsiders"" in Chengdu. The author seems to critique the standards used to judge ""local"" identity — particularly cultural-linguistic and behavioral differences — and suggests that applying such criteria may lead to unfair treatment or stereotyping of anyone not originally from a place, no matter how ""local"" they may seem in other contexts.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""思想意识"" (thoughts and consciousness): Could imply cultural habits or values, possibly linking to **RL4**.
  * ""口音"" (accent): Directly linked to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  * ""穿着品味"" (clothing taste): Could be interpreted as cultural habits or lifestyle, possibly linking to **RL4**.
  * The implicit assumption that even Beijing or Shanghai natives are ""outsiders"" in Chengdu suggests a **socially conventional boundary** of local identity, possibly linking to **RL1**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of accent, mindset, and clothing taste is used to question the legitimacy of using **cultural and linguistic differences** to distinguish locals from non-locals. The author implies these are **arbitrary and exclusionary criteria**.
  * The idea that even Beijing/Shanghai natives are treated as outsiders in Chengdu suggests that **local identity is context-dependent and defined by socially conventional boundaries**, not absolute or universal standards.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does **not endorse** the use of accent, mindset, or clothing taste as valid criteria for defining ""local identity""; rather, they are pointing out how these are **used by others to exclude outsiders**. Therefore, **these do not qualify as RL4 criteria endorsed by the author**.
  * However, the **core idea that even natives of other cities are considered ""non-local"" in Chengdu** reflects a **socially conventional understanding of local identity**, i.e., that local identity is defined by **accepted regional boundaries and mental maps**, which is **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's main point is that **local identity is defined by socially conventional territorial boundaries** — that is, no matter how ""native"" someone is to another city, they are still considered ""non-local"" in Chengdu, implying that **local identity is not about general cultural or behavioral traits, but about accepted regional identity boundaries**.
  * Therefore, the only RL criterion **endorsed by the author** is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Output: RL1**"
哈哈哈点了，大大方方承认不好吗，还要拿什么思想观念口音穿着品味当遮羞布，都21世纪了，不会真有人觉得只有城里人思想前卫穿着讲究品味高档吗至于口音，更加扯淡不是吗,None," The author is mocking or rejecting the idea that certain attributes—such as思想观念 (thoughts/ideology), 口音 (accent), 穿着 (clothing), 品味 (taste or lifestyle)—should be used to distinguish or judge someone as a ""local"" or as more advanced/civilized. They are pushing back against **stereotypes or criteria that others might use** to define ""local"" or superior identity, especially in an urban context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key elements mentioned are:
  - 思想观念 (thoughts/ideology)
  - 口音 (accent)
  - 穿着 (clothing)
  - 品味 (taste or lifestyle)

These potentially map to:
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** – because of the mention of accent.
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** – because the text implicitly critiques a commonly accepted belief that people from the city are more advanced.
- Possibly **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** – if ""思想前卫"" (progressive thinking) is linked to urban lifestyle quality or environment.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is **not endorsing** these criteria; rather, they are **critiquing or rejecting** them. They mock the idea that people use these as markers of being a ""real local"" or being more modern/civilized. These elements are used to **expose and refute** the **false or outdated logic** that others might use to distinguish ""local"" identity or urban superiority.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author is **rejecting** these criteria rather than endorsing them, and is **not using them to define ""local identity"" themselves**, they **do not qualify** for annotation under the RL framework as per the task instructions.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL categories apply because the author is not using or endorsing any criteria to define ""local identity"". Instead, they are criticizing others' use of such criteria.

认识的成都本地朋友中，没有这种人。网上一刷，这成都的鄙视链比北京都严重。比京二环的好像要牛气多了,RL1," The author is expressing surprise and disbelief at the existence of a strong ""local identity hierarchy"" or ""local superiority complex"" in Chengdu, particularly based on observations from online discussions. They contrast this with their personal experience of knowing actual locals who don't exhibit such attitudes. The core assertion is that **some people online use certain criteria to construct a hierarchy of local identity**, which the author seems to critique or at least find noteworthy.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都本地朋友"" (Chengdu local friends) — RL1 (implies a conventional understanding of who is local)
  - ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of contempt) — suggests a ranking logic, potentially involving RL1 or RL4
  - ""比北京都严重"" (more severe than Beijing) — comparison of regional identity dynamics, possibly RL1
  - ""比京二环的好像要牛气多了"" (seem more arrogant than Beijing’s 2nd Ring residents) — implies a symbolic status tied to location, possibly RL1 or RL6

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author contrasts their **personal experience** of local friends (RL1) with the **online portrayal** of local identity as exclusionary and hierarchical.
  - The ""hierarchy"" and ""arrogance"" described suggest **symbolic territorial identity** (RL1), where certain areas or identities are seen as superior, forming a **mental map** or **status-based perception** of who counts as ""truly local"".
  - The mention of Beijing’s 2nd Ring implies a **cross-city comparison** of how **certain urban zones** are symbolically elevated, reinforcing the idea of **socially conventional territorial identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the hierarchy or arrogance; rather, they highlight it as something **not reflected in real local people**.
  - However, the **author implicitly acknowledges** that some people **use symbolic territorial identity (RL1)** to define or rank ""localness"", even if the author critiques it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **not endorsing** the hierarchy but is **highlighting its existence** in discourse. Still, the **core logic used by others (which the author is referencing)** is based on **symbolic and conventional notions of territorial identity**, i.e., certain areas or identities are seen as superior.
  - Therefore, the **author indirectly acknowledges RL1** as a **criterion used in defining local identity**, even if they seem to resist it.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL1"
成都二环内土著，问就是没优越感，我也没什么社交圈子，有几个朋友，大多不是本地人，也没觉得啥,N/A," The author identifies as a ""二环内土著"" (native/natural-born resident within the Second Ring Road) in Chengdu, which implies a certain rootedness in the local area. However, the author explicitly denies having any sense of superiority (""问就是没优越感""), and further states that they don't have much of a social circle, most of their friends are not locals, and they don't perceive any significant difference because of it. The core expressive intent is to **downplay the importance or relevance of being a ""local"" in defining identity or social status**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""二环内土著"" – Suggests a strong local identity, possibly linked to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) and **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  * ""没优越感"" – Indicates the author does **not** endorse the idea of elevated status due to local identity, which may **reject** certain RL6 or RL1 implications.
  * ""没什么社交圈子...大多不是本地人"" – Implies that the author does not associate local identity with social integration or network depth, possibly rejecting **RL6**.
  * ""也没觉得啥"" – Overall neutral or dismissive attitude toward the importance of being local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * **RL1 (Territorial Identity):** Mentioned via ""二环内土著"", which could imply a strong territorial identity. However, the author **explicitly rejects** the relevance or superiority associated with this identity.
  * **RL3 (Historical/Family Rootedness):** Implied through ""土著"", which often connotes long-standing local presence. But again, the author downplays its significance.
  * **RL6 (Social Roots & Economic Status):** The author denies having a strong social circle or local influence, and does not link local identity with status or network, thus **rejecting** this logic.
  * The author’s overall stance is **anti-essentialist**—they do not believe local identity carries significant social or symbolic weight.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **does not endorse** any RL criteria as valid for defining or evaluating local identity. Instead, they **reject** the relevance of territorial identity (RL1), rootedness (RL3), and social/economic integration (RL6) as meaningful indicators of ""localness"" or superiority.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  While the text **mentions** elements related to RL1 and RL3, the author **explicitly denies** their relevance in defining or evaluating local identity. Therefore, **no RL category is endorsed** by the author as a valid criterion for defining ""local people"".

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output:"
小时候没有成都土著这个概念，这十年也不知道是谁定义了这个概念,RL1," *   The author is expressing confusion or critique about the emergence of the concept of ""Chengdu native"" (成都土著), suggesting that it was not commonly used before and questioning who introduced or defined this identity label in recent years.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The phrase ""小时候没有...这个概念"" (didn’t have this concept as a child) implies a **temporal change** in identity discourse.
  *   The question ""也不知道是谁定义了这个概念"" (don’t know who defined this concept) suggests the author perceives a **newly constructed identity boundary** or definition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is **critiquing or questioning the legitimacy or origin** of the concept of “Chengdu native,” implying that it is a **socially constructed or recently imposed identity label**.
  *   The author is not necessarily defining what a local is, but is **reflecting on how the concept of local identity has changed**, and possibly **resisting the idea** that such a label should carry meaning.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not explicitly endorse** any specific RL criteria.
  *   However, the author **implies that the concept of “local” has been redefined socially**, possibly aligning with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it involves the **social construction and changing perception of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author reflects on how the **social understanding or labeling of local identity has changed**, suggesting that the idea of “Chengdu native” is not natural or timeless, but rather a **recent social construct** used to **define who belongs and who doesn’t**, aligning with **RL1**.

RL1, RL3, RL4, RL6"," * The author is expressing a sense of nostalgia and longing for a past where local identity was more rooted in community ties, lifestyle, and certain privileges (e.g., rural or suburban benefits, military family perks). They do not feel that being a ""native"" or ""local"" (土著) brings much superiority, but they do feel a sense of loss and emotional attachment to their original local identity and the associated lifestyle.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土著"" — Suggests a self-identification as a native/local person.
  * ""从长顺街出来的"" — Indicates a birthplace or long-term residence, implying rootedness.
  * ""周边的城乡结合部，有分红，有拆迁，有土地"" — Implies economic and social rootedness (RL6).
  * ""农村来的，过年可以回乡下放火炮，杀猪，天然无污染环境"" — Implies cultural and lifestyle differences, possibly cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4), or rootedness (RL3).
  * ""很多同学都是军区后勤的家属，也羡慕啊，什么都有优待"" — Implies social privilege tied to identity or occupation, possibly RL7 or RL6.
  * ""还是很怀念以前长顺上街，中街以及长发街附近的老邻居些"" — Implies emotional attachment to a local area, possibly RL1.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses these elements to **contrast their own local identity with others who have different or more advantageous local identities**, showing that being a ""native"" does not necessarily equate to privilege. These elements support the idea that **local identity is complex and tied to multiple factors beyond just birthplace**, and that the author feels a sense of emotional and social loss.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not reject** these elements; rather, they **implicitly accept** them as meaningful markers of local identity (e.g., rural lifestyle, community dividends, neighborhood ties), even if they themselves do not possess them now.
  * These are **used to define or evaluate different types of ""local"" identities** and their perceived advantages or disadvantages.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author identifies as a native/local person (""土著"") and grew up in a specific neighborhood (""从长顺街出来的""), indicating a personal history-based local identity.
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The rural lifestyle (firecrackers, slaughtering pigs, natural environment) implies a cultural distinction that the author admires and associates with a desirable local identity.
  * **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author expresses envy of those with land, dividends, and拆迁 (demolition compensation), indicating that these are seen as **markers of a more materially secure or ""rooted"" local identity**.
  * **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author's nostalgia for the old neighborhood and specific street names implies a **symbolic emotional attachment to a certain local area**, which contributes to their sense of local identity.

我家反正是三环外城乡结合部，周边啥都有反正不进城里玩一般,"** RL1, RL5"," The author is describing their residential area as being in a suburban-rural fringe area beyond the third ring road. They indicate that their area has everything they need, and they don't usually go into the city center for activities. The key point is the **implicit contrast between their peripheral location and the perceived core urban ""local"" space**, suggesting that not going into the city is normal because their area is self-sufficient. This implies a **definition of local identity tied to a mental map of the city**, where the city center is not necessarily the defining space of being “local.”

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “三环外城乡结合部” (suburban-rural fringe beyond the third ring road): This is a **spatial definition** based on perceived geography.
  - “周边啥都有” (everything is around here): This suggests **functional livability**, indicating the area is self-sufficient.
  - “不进城里玩一般” (usually don’t go into the city center to hang out): This implies a **mental boundary** or **territorial identity**, suggesting that the author does not feel the need to be part of the central urban space to be considered local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **mention of location beyond the third ring road** is not just a description—it's used to **define the author’s own local identity** in contrast to the city center.
  - The **self-sufficiency of the area** supports the author’s claim that they are part of a **local space that doesn't need the city center** to be valid.
  - The **lack of need to go into the city** implies that the author sees their area as a **legitimate local space**, even if it's on the periphery.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not reject** the idea that their area is local; rather, they affirm it through the self-sufficiency and territorial stance.
  - The **core criteria used to define ""local""** include:
    - A **territorial identity** based on spatial perception (RL1).
    - A **functional definition** of local area based on livability (RL5).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author implicitly accepts and affirms the **identity of being “local” from a suburban-rural fringe area**, which may not be traditionally seen as central, but is still part of a local mental map.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: The author implies that their area qualifies as a **legitimate local space** because it has everything they need and functions as a complete living environment.

This is expressed through their derogatory attitude (e.g., using terms like ""弯脚杆"") toward people living outside the third ring road, implying that those beyond this boundary are not ""true locals.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""老土著"" (old locals)** implies a sense of rootedness and local identity.
  - **""住在那种老破小的"" (living in old, small, rundown houses)** suggests a certain lifestyle and residential history, potentially pointing to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - **""三环外"" (outside the third ring road)** indicates a **territorial boundary** used to distinguish who is considered truly local — a **symbolic boundary**.
  - **""5句话就有弯脚杆"" (mentioning ""bent foot rod"" within 5 sentences)** — a derogatory term, indicates **cultural-linguistic exclusion** or **social segregation** based on speech or origin.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to **residential history and generational rootedness** (RL3) is used to explain **why** some locals feel superior and define local identity narrowly.
  - The **territorial boundary of ""三环"" (third ring road)** functions as a **symbolic mental map** (RL1) that some locals use to define who belongs and who doesn’t.
  - The **use of derogatory language** (""弯脚杆"") indicates **cultural-linguistic exclusion** (RL4), reinforcing the idea that certain speech patterns or origins mark someone as an outsider.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not personally endorse** the criteria of exclusion but **describes how others use them** to define local identity.
  - However, the author **implicitly acknowledges** that these criteria (territorial boundary, rootedness, and cultural-linguistic markers) are **functionally used by some locals** to define who counts as ""local"" — and the author presents this as a **notable and somewhat negative phenomenon**, not as resistance or rejection.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author references the **third ring road** as a **symbolic boundary** used by some locals to distinguish between ""true locals"" and others.

好像！！？你说的有道理！！！不过成都土著没有拆迁户过的轻松就不明白这优越感哪里来的hhh,None," The author is expressing skepticism about the source of ""superiority"" or ""pride"" among native Chengdu residents (""成都土著""), implying that this sense of local identity is not clearly justified, especially when compared to the living conditions of those who benefited from demolition compensation (""拆迁户""). The author seems to question the legitimacy of the local identity claim by ""native"" residents.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""成都土著"" → possibly RL3 (family historical rootedness)
- ""拆迁户"" → possibly RL6 (economic status symbolism, as demolition compensation often brings financial gain)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL3 (""成都土著"")**: The author is implicitly critiquing the assumption that being a ""native"" (i.e., long-standing resident or born in Chengdu) grants any real advantage or legitimacy in claiming local identity. The phrase is used to question the validity of this identity marker.
- **RL6 (""拆迁户"")**: The author contrasts ""native"" identity with economic benefit from urban development, implying that material or economic status (RL6) may in practice offer more real-life advantage than historical rootedness.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **does not endorse** RL3 (historical rootedness) as a valid or meaningful basis for local superiority.
- The author also **does not explicitly endorse** RL6 (economic status), but uses it to **contrast** and **undermine** the perceived legitimacy of RL3.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- Although the author critiques RL3 and references RL6, **neither is endorsed as a standard the author themselves would use** to define local identity. The author is **questioning the basis of local identity altogether**, rather than proposing or endorsing any specific RL-based criteria.

成都人不是被骂的人吗？陈冠希。假打。口音难听。全是槽点。,RL4**," The author is expressing a **negative judgment** towards people from Chengdu, primarily based on **linguistic and cultural traits**. They associate being from Chengdu with being criticized (""被骂的人""), mock a specific behavior (""假打""), and point out the **undesirable qualities of accent and behavior** as reasons for ridicule or criticism.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “成都人” (Chengdu people) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - “口音难听” (accent is unpleasant) → RL4
  - “假打” (phony/fake behavior) → RL4 (interpreted as a culturally specific behavior)
  - “全是槽点” (full of points to mock) → RL4 (implies cultural and linguistic characteristics are mockable, thus identity-defining)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **not defining who is a local** in a positive sense, but rather **mocking a group often seen as outsiders or stereotyped locals**.
  - However, the **criteria used to mock** — accent, behavior, and cultural traits — are **precisely the same criteria** that **function as markers of local identity** in many contexts.
  - Therefore, the author is **implicitly affirming that these are the criteria by which people identify someone as a Chengdu local**, even if negatively framed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** these criteria — they are using them as **the basis for judgment**, which implies **implicit endorsement** of their relevance in defining local identity.
  - The text does not involve RL1 (territorial identity), RL2 (administrative), RL3 (historical rootedness), RL5 (livability), RL6 (social roots), or RL7 (occupation).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **accent** and **cultural behavior** (e.g., “口音难听”, “假打”) to define who is seen as a “成都人”, and thus these are **identity markers** that distinguish locals from others.
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author implicitly accepts that **accent and cultural behavior** are criteria for identifying local identity.

**Output: RL4**"
都是外地人歧视成都口音的嘛,** RL4," The author is expressing a sense of confusion or frustration, implying that there may be a bias or negative perception from others toward people with a Chengdu accent, suggesting that the speaker perceives this accent-based judgment as unfair or widespread.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key element here is the mention of a **local accent** — specifically, the **Chengdu accent** — which is being subjected to **discrimination or negative evaluation**. This points to a **linguistic marker** being used to distinguish insiders from outsiders.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of the Chengdu accent serves to **highlight a criterion used by others to identify someone as non-local**, which the author finds problematic or worth questioning. Although the author is not explicitly endorsing this criterion, they are **implicitly revealing that this is a commonly used standard in society** — one that defines who is considered ""local"" or not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  While the author does not personally endorse the discrimination, they **implicitly acknowledge that accent (a cultural-linguistic trait) is used as a standard to judge local identity**, which is consistent with the RL4 definition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author’s question implies that **a Chengdu accent is treated as a marker of non-local identity**, revealing that **linguistic traits are being used as a de facto standard for evaluating local identity**. This aligns with RL4, which concerns the use of language or accent as a criterion for determining who belongs to the local group.

**Output:** RL4"
我觉得成都口音挺好听的呀。,RL4," * The author is expressing a positive personal sentiment toward the Chengdu accent, implying that they find it pleasant or agreeable.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “成都口音” (Chengdu accent), which is directly related to speech and linguistic identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of the Chengdu accent plays a role in expressing familiarity or affinity with the local culture or people. Although the statement is brief and subjective, it implies that linguistic features (specifically accent) are part of the author's perception of what constitutes local identity.
  * The author is not rejecting this criterion but is instead affirming its appeal, suggesting that accent plays a role in their perception of ""localness"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not defining someone as ""non-local"" or making a strict boundary judgment, but they are **positively associating** the Chengdu accent with local identity.
  * This implies that **language or accent** is a factor the author associates with being local — not necessarily as a gatekeeping criterion, but as a **marker of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it involves using accent — a linguistic feature — to identify or positively associate with local identity.
  * There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of other RL categories (e.g., administrative status, generational history, etc.).

The author emphasizes that most people they interact with are non-local, and that for the average person (""打工人""), there is no inherent sense of superiority or inferiority based on origin. However, they note that some local individuals—specifically ""拆迁户老嬢嬢"" (local elderly women from demolished housing areas)—do exhibit a sense of superiority, which can be off-putting. The author also comments on marriage patterns, noting that while many local classmates marry locally, some do marry outside the region, suggesting that this is not a strict rule.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses the **low proportion of local people** in their environment.
  - Mentions of **marriage patterns** among local people.
  - Reference to **demographic characteristics** and **interpersonal dynamics**.
  - Implicit contrast between **ordinary people** and **certain local groups (拆迁户)** who exhibit superiority.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **does not** endorse the idea that being a ""local"" is defined by superiority or identity claims made by certain groups (like 拆迁户老嬢嬢), and in fact, criticizes it.
  - The author **does not** use **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**, or **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** as criteria for defining local identity.
  - The mention of **marriage patterns** is **not** used by the author as a standard for defining who is ""local"" or not; it's just an observation about social trends.
  - The author **emphasizes equality**—that most people are ""打工人"" and thus origin doesn't matter in daily life.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not** explicitly or implicitly endorse **any** criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author’s core argument is that **for most people, being local or not doesn’t matter much**, and that **claims of superiority by certain locals are unwarranted**.
  - Therefore, **no RL criteria are used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - There is **no endorsement of any RL category** by the author.
  - The author **rejects** the relevance of **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**—as they criticize 拆迁户老嬢嬢 for their sense of superiority.
  - The author does not define ""local"" through **territory, administration, history, language, culture, economy, or occupation**.

小时候有，因为确实不给房租，用完回家吃饭睡觉，过得比来成都打工的同事好很多，而且四川其他地方来打工的听说你是本地人，他们很羡慕哈，本来我没觉得咋的后来就越来越不觉得了，感觉小孩父母都是过节回老家，我女曾经说我们咋没有老家我说就成都呀，她还觉得不安逸，都没地方回人家也都在成都买了房定居了，所以也没啥优越不优越感觉了,"** RL3, RL6"," The author is reflecting on how their perception of being a ""local"" (in Chengdu) has evolved over time. Initially, they experienced certain implicit advantages of being local—such as not paying rent and having a place to return for meals and rest—compared to migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan. These outsiders once envied the author for being a local. However, over time, the author's sense of local identity has weakened. They note that even migrant families now consider Chengdu their home, having bought property and settled down. This blurs the boundary between ""locals"" and ""non-locals,"" leading the author to feel that there's no longer a clear sense of superiority or distinctiveness tied to being a local.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “四川其他地方来打工的听说你是本地人，他们很羡慕哈” – Implies a sense of **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) and **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as being a local once conferred a sense of rootedness and subtle privilege.
  - “小孩父母都是过节回老家” – Implies a contrast between those with family roots elsewhere and the author’s family, who now consider Chengdu home, indicating **RL3** again.
  - “我女曾经说我们咋没有老家我说就成都呀” – This shows a generational shift in identity and suggests that Chengdu itself is now considered the family’s rooted place, reinforcing **RL3**.
  - “人家也都在成都买了房定居了” – Implies that others have now also established **RL6** markers (property ownership, settlement), which used to be associated with being a ""local,"" but are no longer exclusive to locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The RL3 elements (rootedness, generational history) were once used to distinguish the author as a ""true local"" and provided a sense of privilege. However, the author now feels that distinction is fading.
  - The RL6 elements (property, settlement) were once associated with ""local"" identity, but the author observes that migrants are now matching or surpassing locals in these aspects, eroding the traditional boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author reflects on the **historical rootedness** (RL3) as a once-significant marker of being local and still acknowledges Chengdu as their family’s “home.”
  - The author also implicitly acknowledges **economic and residential settlement** (RL6) as a **shared standard** between locals and non-locals now, which contributes to the erosion of a unique local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL3** to reflect on how being ""born and raised here"" used to define local identity.
  - The author uses **RL6** to show how property ownership and settlement—once seen as signs of being rooted—are now shared by migrants, making the local identity less distinctive.

**Step 6: Output Result**

**Output:** RL3, RL6"
没有，倒是会被外地人歧视，说我说话口音牙尖弯酸，天天都说“电炒饭”,** RL4," The author is expressing a personal experience of being discriminated against by outsiders due to their accent and the way they speak, specifically mentioning the phrase “电炒饭” (fried rice cooked with electricity, a colloquial or local way of speaking). This implies that the author feels their **linguistic and cultural traits** are perceived as markers of local identity by others—and used as a basis for judgment or exclusion.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “说话口音” (speaking accent) → potentially related to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
  - “天天都说‘电炒饭’” (always say 'electric fried rice') → also related to **RL4**, as it reflects a specific linguistic habit or cultural marker associated with locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not celebrating or affirming these traits, but they are clearly **used by others to identify the author as a local**, and this identification leads to discrimination. Therefore, the **author implicitly acknowledges** that these linguistic features are **used as a criterion to judge local identity**, even if the author may not personally endorse the logic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not resist or negate the idea that their speech habits mark them as local; rather, they are highlighting that this is how they are perceived and judged. Therefore, the **linguistic criteria are accepted as part of the local identity definition**, even if the author finds it unfair.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author's speech accent and specific expressions are used as criteria to identify them as a local, even if it is done negatively.

The phrase *""被别个说我的口音好难听""* (someone criticized my accent as sounding bad) implies a sense of **linguistic marginalization**. The defiant tone (""我想说关你毛线事，我爱咋咋说"") suggests the author **strongly resists being judged** by accent or dialect as a marker of local belonging.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **Accent / Dialect (RL4):** ""口音"" (accent) is directly mentioned as a point of criticism.
  *   **Geographic Commute (RL1):** The fact that the author lives in **Dujiangyan** but works in **Chengdu** hints at a **territorial boundary issue** and potential **identity dissonance** between urban core and surrounding areas.
  *   **Defiant Attitude Toward Judgment Criteria:** The author **rejects** being judged by accent, implying that **RL4 is not a valid or accepted standard** for defining local identity in their view.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author is **rejecting** this as a valid criterion for judging local identity. The criticism of their accent is something they **resist and refute**, so it should **not be annotated**.
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Implicitly, the author is caught between two places—living in Dujiangyan but working in Chengdu. However, the author is not **endorsing or proposing a new mental map or boundary**, but rather **expressing discomfort** at being judged based on such boundaries. Therefore, this is not **explicitly or implicitly endorsed** as a criterion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** any criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this text. They **reject** the idea that accent (RL4) or place of residence (RL1) should be used to judge someone’s local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   No RL criteria are **endorsed** by the author. The text centers on **resistance to being judged** using **linguistic** or **territorial** criteria, but does **not affirm** any alternative standard or logic.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**: Used to **define authentic local identity** as rooted in **generational continuity**, **childhood experiences**, and **ancestral connection** to the place.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: Used to **distinguish locals from outsiders** through shared language (Chengdu dialect), cultural habits, and shared tastes.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: Used to show **intimate, emotional familiarity with the city**, which the author sees as a mark of true localness.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots)**: Used to emphasize **long-term social continuity** as a key component of being a real local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - All of the above RLs are **explicitly or implicitly endorsed** by the author and are **used to define who is a real local** or what makes a place truly ""local"" in the author’s eyes.
  - The author **resists** property ownership or wealth as criteria for defining locals, so RL5 and RL6-related economic criteria are **not endorsed**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author defines ""local people"" not by material wealth or administrative status, but by **deep historical, cultural, linguistic, and social ties** to Chengdu. This includes **multi-generational rootedness (RL3)**, **shared dialect and cultural habits (RL4)**, **intimate knowledge of the city (RL1)**, and **long-standing social relationships (RL6)**.

哈喽冒昧了，同成华区土著三代成都人，本人条件能看口音可查，能了解一哈不,"** `RL1, RL3, RL4`"," The author introduces themselves as a ""三代成都人"" (third-generation Chengdu native) and a ""同成华区土著"" (fellow native of Chengdu's Chenghua District), and asks if the other person can ""看口音可查"" — implying that accent or dialect can be used to verify whether someone is a local. The author is asserting their local identity and appears to be initiating a comparison or inquiry into shared local identity markers.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""成华区土著"" — suggests a specific local territorial identity within Chengdu, possibly implying a strong local attachment or identity with Chenghua District.
  * ""三代成都人"" — indicates three generations of family rooted in Chengdu, suggesting historical rootedness.
  * ""看口音可查"" — implies that accent is a way to verify local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * ""成华区土著"" functions to establish a **specific local identity** tied to a district, beyond just being a Chengdu native — it suggests a more specific local territorial affiliation.
  * ""三代成都人"" supports the author's claim of **deep-rootedness** in the local area, serving as a legitimacy marker for being a ""true local"".
  * ""看口音可查"" implies that **language or accent** is a recognized and accepted marker of local identity — something the author assumes the other person would understand or share.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly **endorses** being a ""土著"" (native) of a specific district (成华区) as a marker of local identity — this aligns with **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  * The author clearly **endorses** being a ""三代成都人"" — three generations rooted in Chengdu — as a marker of local identity — this aligns with **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness).
  * The author clearly **endorses** accent (""口音"") as a way to verify local identity — this aligns with **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author asserts their local identity based on three criteria:
  1. They are a native of Chenghua District — suggesting that not just being from Chengdu, but being from a specific part of it, carries symbolic weight in defining ""local"".
  2. They are a third-generation Chengdu resident — implying that historical rootedness is central to being a ""true local"".
  3. They imply that accent can be used to verify this identity — suggesting that linguistic patterns are a key marker of local belonging.

These three criteria are **explicitly or strongly implied** by the author as standards they themselves use (or assume others use) to define who counts as a ""local"".

**Output:** `RL1, RL3, RL4`"
有，比上海更甚，直接对你说你说的话（口音）他们听不懂，是哪个县份上的,"RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing that in the place they are referring to, there is a strong regional linguistic divide — so much so that even the local people cannot understand someone speaking with a different accent. The author is emphasizing the importance of **local linguistic identity**, suggesting that one's specific place of origin (even down to the county level) is clearly detectable and significant.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""你说的话（口音）他们听不懂"" (They can't even understand what you're saying (your accent)) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - ""是哪个县份上的"" (Which county are you from?) → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author uses the idea of mutual unintelligibility due to accent to highlight strong linguistic boundaries. This functions as a **clear marker of local identity**, where speaking a certain way is a defining trait of being local.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The question “which county are you from?” implies that **local identity is not just about a broad region but specific sub-regions**, and that people can tell the difference based on speech. This reflects a **socially accepted cognitive boundary** and segmentation within the broader region.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Both RL4 and RL1 are **endorsed by the author** and used to **define local identity** — the former through language and accent, the latter through the recognition of fine-grained territorial identity (county-level).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **language and accent** (RL4) are key to identifying whether someone is local, as locals cannot understand outsiders due to linguistic differences.
  - The author also implies that **local identity is tied to specific counties** (RL1), and that people can detect this fine-grained identity through speech, reinforcing the idea of **socially conventional territorial boundaries**.

The author seems to believe that speaking the local dialect (or not) has implications for social acceptance and identity affiliation.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase ""一口四川话"" (speaking Sichuan dialect) is directly related to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  *   The mention of ""联姻"" (intermarriage) implies social integration and identity boundaries, which is often tied to cultural and linguistic identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is using the **Sichuan dialect** as a **criterion for social evaluation**, implying that speaking it may make someone less desirable in social or familial contexts.
  *   This suggests that **linguistic identity** plays a role in how the author perceives ""localness"" or social belonging.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that speaking a local dialect (or not speaking a stigmatized dialect like Sichuanese) is relevant to **social acceptance and identity affiliation**.
  *   This aligns with **RL4**, as the author is using linguistic features to evaluate or distinguish ""local"" vs. ""non-local"" identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is suggesting that **speaking Sichuan dialect** is a socially disadvantageous trait, potentially affecting **intermarriage and social integration**. This implies that **language or accent** is a **criterion for defining local identity or social belonging**, which is the core of **RL4**.

She emphasizes that despite being a local (成都人), she and many of her peers or family members have broader life experiences (e.g., studying abroad, working in diverse environments), and she personally rejects the kind of local pride or superiority that is based on superficial markers like property ownership. She also clearly opposes using certain criteria (like family background or property) to judge local identity and instead promotes values like personal effort, professional skill, and humility.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity): Mentions of Chengdu locals and identity perception.
  - RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): Not present.
  - RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History): Mentions of being a local (成都人), family ties, and possibly growing up in the area.
  - RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition): Not directly mentioned.
  - RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition): Not present.
  - RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism): Mentions of property ownership, salary level, and not flaunting them.
  - RL7 (Occupational Symbolism): Mentions of working in the internet industry, and the occupational status of herself and others.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL1: The author is pushing back against stereotypical notions of what it means to be a Chengdu person. She redefines the local identity in a more inclusive and personal way, not based on territorial pride.
  - RL3: She implies that she is a local (成都人), but her personal identity is not defined solely by birthplace or family background.
  - RL6: She owns property and earns a high salary, but explicitly **rejects** flaunting these as markers of superiority. She defines her ""superiority"" or ""pride"" in terms of personal values (hard work, humility), not material status.
  - RL7: She mentions working in a professional field (internet industry), and that many in leadership roles are from outside Chengdu, which implies that professional identity is more important than local identity in her worldview.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL1: The author acknowledges the conventional identity of being a Chengdu person but redefines it.
  - RL3: She implicitly accepts being a local by birth but does not emphasize it as a core criterion for identity.
  - RL7: She emphasizes her professional identity and that of others as more significant than local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's main point is that being a ""local"" (成都人) should not be defined by superficial or stereotypical criteria (like boasting, property ownership, or family background), but rather by personal qualities like hard work, humility, and professional capability. She aligns herself with RL1 (being a local by conventional identity) but redefines it in a way that incorporates RL7 (occupational symbolism), emphasizing professional identity over territorial or familial identity.

   - Also implies **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – distinguishing between ""real Chengdu"" and ""South Chengdu"" as a symbolic boundary.

2. *“天府新区那边一堆农民拆迁的，整体素质不高”*
   - Implies **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** – linking local identity with economic status and social standing.
   - Also implies **RL1** again – using a **territorial label** (""Tianfu New Area"") to exclude people from being ""real locals"".

3. *“华阳，龙泉也能叫成都？只认五城区哈”*
   - Strongly implies **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – only recognizing the ""Five Urban Districts"" as ""real Chengdu"".
   - Implies **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – possibly referencing older or more ""core"" administrative divisions.

4. *“土生土长的本地人都是享受生活的”*
   - Implies **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – ""native locals"" are those who are ""born and raised here"".
   - Also implies a **cultural stereotype** – possibly linking to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, though more indirectly.

5. *“除了五城区，都是郊区”*
   - Again, **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – defining the scope of ""real local"" identity based on a mental map or conventional boundary.

6. *“个人感想：这种觉得自己土著的人（包括且不限于成都，上海，北京）在外面但凡遇到个比他城市好优越的土著，就秒变舔狗...”*
   - This is the **author's own viewpoint**, which **rejects** the above RL-based criteria as **superficial, exclusionary, and ultimately insecure**. The author **does not endorse** these criteria but is **critiquing** them.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The RL elements listed above are **not the author's own beliefs**. Instead, they are **representations of a mindset the author is mocking and condemning**. The author uses these examples to illustrate how people define ""local identity"" based on exclusionary and shallow criteria (territorial, occupational, historical, etc.), and then **rejects** them by pointing out the absurdity and insecurity behind such definitions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author **does not endorse** any of these RL-based definitions of local identity, and is in fact **strongly critical** of them, **none of the RL categories apply** to the author's own criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is not defining their own criteria for ""local identity"", but rather **exposing and ridiculing** others’ use of exclusionary and symbolic ranking logic. Therefore, **no RL category applies to the author’s own view**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
Output: None"
给你讲个笑话，成都土著有优越感，哈哈哈哈哈哈,N/A," The author is making a humorous remark about ""Chengdu natives having a sense of superiority,"" likely poking fun at the idea that being a local in Chengdu (or any city) automatically grants someone a higher status or a sense of being ""better than others."" The laughter (""哈哈哈哈哈哈"") suggests it's meant to be lighthearted or ironic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “成都土著” (Chengdu native), which relates to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** — being rooted in a place for generations or having been born and raised there. The notion of ""优越感"" (superiority complex) implies that the speaker is aware of a social perception that locals may feel they are better due to this rootedness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase ""成都土著有优越感"" functions as a **social observation or stereotype** that the author finds amusing. However, the tone is not one of endorsement but rather **mild mockery or satire**. The author is not asserting that Chengdu natives *should* be considered superior or that rootedness is a valid criterion for defining local identity — instead, they are making a humorous comment on the *perception* of such superiority.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Although the text mentions a criterion (RL3), it does **not** represent a standard that the author **endorses** for defining ""local identity."" Rather, it is used to set up a joke — possibly even critiquing or poking fun at the idea of local superiority. Therefore, **RL3 is not endorsed by the author** in this context.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  Since the author does **not** explicitly or implicitly endorse any standard for defining ""local identity"" (but rather comments on a perceived social stereotype), **no RL category applies**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

  *   The text mentions:
      *   **Economic conditions** (house ownership, retirement salary, financial stability).
      *   **Family background** (urban vs. rural, financial burden of elderly care).
      *   **Implicitly rejects** the relevance of local identity (e.g., ""this has nothing to do with being a Chengdu native"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author **rejects** the idea that local identity (e.g., being a native of Chengdu or any city) is a relevant criterion for evaluating marital compatibility.
  *   The author **emphasizes economic and familial factors** (RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism) as the **true criteria** used to assess compatibility, particularly ownership of property, retirement income, and whether the child will have to bear the burden of supporting aging parents.
  *   The author implies that **economic disparity**, not geographic or local identity differences, is what leads to incompatibility.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** any of the RL criteria related to defining ""local identity"" (e.g., territorial identity, cultural-linguistic recognition, administrative legitimacy, etc.).
  *   Instead, the author **explicitly endorses economic and familial financial stability** as the **key criteria** for determining marital compatibility, which falls under **RL6**, but **not as a criterion for defining local identity**, but rather for evaluating **marital suitability**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author **does not define or endorse any criteria for determining ""local identity""** in this text.
  *   The author **rejects the relevance of local identity** and instead **replaces it with economic and familial financial conditions** as the **true evaluative standard**, but **not for defining local identity**.

RL1, RL5, RL6"," The author is expressing concern about the impact of urban renewal on low-income populations in Chengdu, arguing that the city's charm and livability come from its inclusiveness — particularly its ability to accommodate low-income groups and maintain low living costs through older residential areas. The author implies that true ""local"" qualities of Chengdu include **social inclusiveness and accessibility**, not just physical or economic development.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""成都人均收入并不高"" → Suggests economic heterogeneity, but not directly about local identity.
  - ""城市全部翻新之后，就把低收入人群赶出去了"" → Indicates a concern with displacement due to urban change, possibly linking to identity and inclusiveness.
  - ""没有低收入人群服务，生活成本就上去了"" → Implies that the presence of low-income populations contributes to a livable, functional local environment.
  - ""成都的老小区生活便利，低收入人群也住的舒服，包容性很强"" → Strongly implies that Chengdu’s traditional or older neighborhoods contribute to a sense of inclusiveness and local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses the idea of **inclusive living environments** and the **presence of low-income populations** to argue that Chengdu retains a kind of authentic, accessible local identity. This is contrasted with the idea of urban renewal pushing out these populations and thereby **eroding the city's local character**. The author values the **traditional, accessible, and socially diverse structure** of Chengdu’s older communities as a core component of what makes Chengdu a true ""local"" city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly values **social inclusiveness**, **community structure**, and **accessibility** (especially in older neighborhoods) as essential qualities that define a desirable and authentic ""local"" environment. These are not just descriptions of economic or social conditions — they are **criteria used to judge the authenticity or quality of ""local"" identity** in Chengdu.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author emphasizes the importance of **low-income populations being present and integrated** in the city, implying that **social diversity and rootedness of all classes** are part of Chengdu’s local identity.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author praises older neighborhoods for being **livable, convenient, and comfortable**, directly linking these qualities to the **definition of a good ""local"" area**.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author contrasts **older, inclusive neighborhoods** with newly developed areas, implying a **symbolic or conventional understanding of where ""real Chengdu"" or ""true local life"" exists**.

The core intent is to **identify areas with specific economic and real estate characteristics**, likely for purchase or investment purposes.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - **一二环** (1st and 2nd Ring Roads): This is a **geographical boundary**, often symbolizing the **core urban area** in major Chinese cities.
  *   - **老小区00年那种** (old communities from around 2000): Refers to a **specific time period of construction**, implying older, possibly more established neighborhoods.
  *   - **每平方米一万以下** (below 10,000 yuan per square meter): This is an **economic threshold**, potentially indicating **affordability or lower status** in the housing market.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - **一二环** (1st and 2nd Ring Roads): The author uses this to **define a desirable geographical scope**, likely due to its central location and perceived status. This implies a **mentally mapped boundary** for what they consider a valuable or accessible ""local"" area.
  *   - **老小区00年那种** (old communities from around 2000): This indicates a preference for **older, established neighborhoods**, possibly with deeper **social roots** or **historical continuity**, though not explicitly stated in terms of family history.
  *   - **每平方米一万以下** (below 10,000 yuan per square meter): This is a **price filter**, indicating the author is looking for **economically accessible housing**, which could reflect **functional livability** or **economic symbolism**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - The author is **not explicitly defining ""local identity""** in terms of **cultural-linguistic traits**, **administrative legitimacy**, or **occupational symbolism**.
  *   - The mention of **一二环** (1st and 2nd Ring Roads) implies a **socially conventional territorial identity**, using a widely accepted mental map of the city's core areas.
  *   - The price threshold (**每平方米一万以下**) and the reference to **older communities** may reflect a **functional livability** or **economic symbolism** in defining the **quality or accessibility of a local area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The use of **一二环** indicates a **conventional understanding of the city's core area**, based on widely accepted urban mental maps.
  *   - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: The **price threshold** and **focus on older communities** suggest a **functional evaluation** of the area’s **livability or accessibility**, even if indirectly.
  *   - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The **price filter** and **reference to older housing** may also imply **economic symbolism** in terms of **affordability or perceived social status**.

RL1, RL3, RL5, RL6"," The author is discussing the practical difficulties and trade-offs in purchasing property in desirable urban areas (specifically in Chengdu), emphasizing the high cost of buying a house in the inner city (within the 2nd ring road) and the necessity of renovating an existing property instead of relocating to the suburbs. The author implicitly conveys a sense of rootedness and attachment to the inner-city area — not only due to convenience and facilities (which relate to livability) but also due to long-term family presence and social networks.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""一两百万买一个环境好点还在二环内的房子"" (A house within the 2nd ring road with decent environment costing several hundred thousand yuan): This points to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as it reflects a judgment of the area’s value and desirability.
  - ""爸妈在成都工作这么久 基本都在一二环内"" (Parents have worked in Chengdu for a long time, mostly in the 1st and 2nd ring areas): This suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), indicating generational presence and family ties to the area.
  - ""朋友也在附近"" (Friends are also nearby): This implies **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), showing deep social integration and attachment to the area.
  - ""买到郊区肯定不现实"" (Moving to the suburbs is not realistic): This reflects a **spatial identity boundary**, suggesting that the core urban area is the legitimate or preferred ""local"" space, which points to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL5** plays a role in highlighting the high standard of urban living and the cost barrier, which contributes to the author's view of what constitutes a desirable ""local"" space.
  - **RL3** supports the idea that the author's family has a long-standing presence in the city, reinforcing their sense of belonging and legitimacy as ""locals"".
  - **RL6** reinforces the author’s social integration and emotional attachment to the area, further strengthening their identification with the inner city as the ""real"" local space.
  - **RL1** is subtly implied through the author's rejection of suburban relocation, which reflects a conventional view of the inner city as the core ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  All four RL elements — **RL1**, **RL3**, **RL5**, and **RL6** — are endorsed by the author and function to construct their sense of local identity and the legitimacy of the inner-city area as the ""true local"" space.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's argument combines a **socially conventional boundary of local space** (RL1), **family historical rootedness** (RL3), **functional livability standards** (RL5), and **depth of social roots** (RL6) to define and affirm their perception of local identity and the value of the inner-city area.

They point out negative characteristics such as **noise and high density**, yet note that **prices are still very high**. This implies a contradiction: the area has poor livability/environmental quality, yet is still considered valuable or desirable. This suggests an implicit evaluation of what makes a place ""local"" or ""good,"" based on property value despite poor living conditions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""紧靠二环边"" (next to the Second Ring Road) — potentially related to **RL1** (territorial identity) or **RL5** (functional livability).
  *   - ""各种噪音和高密度"" (various noises and high density) — potentially related to **RL5** (environmental quality).
  *   - ""价格就是贵贵贵"" (the price is just so expensive) — potentially related to **RL6** (economic symbolism), as high price may imply status or desirability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - ""紧靠二环边"" serves to locate the area in a **symbolically central urban zone**, which is often associated with being ""local"" or ""core"" in city identity.
  *   - ""各种噪音和高密度"" are **negative environmental factors**, yet the author points out that prices are still high — this **contrasts poor RL5 quality with high economic value**, implying that **economic or symbolic status (RL6)**, rather than livability, defines the area's value or local prestige.
  *   - The repeated ""贵贵贵"" emphasizes that **price itself is a marker of status**, which the author seems to critique but also implicitly acknowledges as a standard.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not explicitly endorse** RL5 (livability/environmental quality) as a standard — in fact, they **imply it's lacking**. However, they **do imply that economic value (RL6)** — reflected in high property prices — is what **makes the area still considered ""good"" or ""local""**, despite its poor living conditions.
  *   The location near the Second Ring Road (RL1) is mentioned as a **symbolic marker**, implying that this contributes to the area being seen as ""local"" or ""central"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The phrase ""紧靠二环边"" (next to the Second Ring Road) implies that the location has **symbolic centrality**, often associated with being part of the ""core city"" or ""true local"" area in urban mental maps.
  *   - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The repeated emphasis on high prices (""贵贵贵"") indicates that **economic value is a key marker of local prestige or status**, even if other qualities are poor. The author critiques this but **implicitly accepts it as a standard used in evaluating ""local"" areas**.

They argue that such houses provide more **security**, **autonomy**, and **economic utility**, and they reject the idea that high-rise flats are a genuine sign of improved or luxurious living.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The author mentions **security concerns** (e.g., fire, elevator accidents) as reasons to prefer townhouses/villas.
  *   They express **functional and economic autonomy** as a key value: “啥都是自己说了算” (everything is up to oneself), and “不住的话也可以开公司开工作室” (can be used as office space if not lived in).
  *   They reference **economic value** (“三环内的也有六七百个W的” — properties within the 3rd ring road cost 600–700 million).
  *   They **reject** the idea of ""large flats"" as a legitimate form of improvement or luxury.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **Security concerns** serve as a **functional critique** of high-rise living, but not directly a criterion for defining local identity.
  *   **Autonomy** (self-determination in use and function) and **economic utility** are used to **define what kind of housing represents true local value and authenticity**.
  *   **Economic value** is used to **evaluate the legitimacy and desirability of certain types of housing** within the local area, especially within the 3rd ring road.
  *   The **rejection of large flats** is not just a personal preference, but a **symbolic boundary**—implying that those who live in such properties do not truly understand or embody authentic local living.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not** define local identity based on **territorial boundaries**, **administrative status**, **family history**, **language**, or **occupation**.
  *   However, they **do** use **economic status symbolism and property ownership** as a way to **distinguish authentic local identity** and evaluate the **quality and legitimacy of local residential areas**.
  *   The **economic and social power** associated with owning a villa or townhouse is **explicitly linked to identity legitimacy** and the **definition of ""real"" local living**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The key RL category here is **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.
  *   The author believes that **owning a townhouse or villa** (especially within the 3rd ring) is not just a matter of preference, but a **symbol of true local identity**—because it allows autonomy, has economic value, and is contrasted with the ""fake"" concept of luxury flats.
  *   This implies that **economic capital and property ownership** are criteria for **defining who or what counts as ""authentic local""**.

Initially, they believed that anyone living within the administrative boundaries of Harbin—whether in the city or county—could be considered a Harbin local. However, they encountered a contrasting viewpoint on Xiaohongshu (小红书) that only people from certain central urban districts (e.g., Daoli 道里) are ""real"" Harbin locals, while county residents are considered rural and not truly part of the local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""哈尔滨辖区内不管市里还是县里的""** – Implies an **administrative** definition of local identity.
  *   **""县里的都是农村的 不属于哈尔滨人""** – Suggests **socially conventional territorial identity**, where certain areas are not considered truly local based on social perception.
  *   **""老哈尔滨人只有道里的""** – Implies **socially conventional territorial identity**, where only people from specific core districts are considered authentic locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is **challenging** the **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** perspective (that anyone in Harbin's jurisdiction is a local) and presenting an alternative view based on **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**, where only people from certain districts (like Daoli) are seen as authentic locals.
  *   The **RL1 elements** are used to show how **social perceptions and mental maps** define local identity more strictly than administrative boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** the administrative boundary logic (RL2) as the final standard.
  *   The author **presents and implicitly accepts** the **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** logic as a **real or influential standard** used by others (e.g., ""老哈尔滨人只有道里的"") to define who is a local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is reflecting on how **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**—rather than administrative boundaries—shapes the perception of who counts as a ""real"" local.

They seem to be pointing out that while it's acceptable for people from surrounding counties to say they are from Harbin (as they fall under its administrative jurisdiction), it is considered **ridiculous or inappropriate** for them to claim to be **""native to the main urban area"" (主城区土生土长)**. This implies the author sees a **hierarchy in local identity**, where being a native of the **main urban core** is a stronger or more legitimate form of ""localness"" than merely being from the broader Harbin area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   “区” (district) vs. “县” (county) — suggests **administrative distinctions**
  *   “属于哈市辖区范围内” — implies **administrative legitimacy** is a factor in claiming Harbin identity
  *   “主城区土生土长” — implies **birth and growth in a specific local area** (main urban area) is a stronger form of local identity
  *   “挺搞笑的” — shows the author **resists** the idea of someone from a county claiming to be a native of the main urban area

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **Administrative boundaries (RL2)** are acknowledged as a **basic standard** for claiming affiliation with Harbin — people from surrounding counties can say they are from Harbin because they are under its jurisdiction.
  *   **Birth and upbringing in the main urban area (RL3)** is **endorsed as a stronger or more authentic form of local identity**, particularly in contrast to those from surrounding counties.
  *   The author **does not endorse** the idea that administrative affiliation alone is sufficient for claiming deep local identity — instead, **local identity is layered**, with the main urban natives being more ""legitimate"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — The author acknowledges administrative boundaries as a **baseline for local identity** (people from surrounding counties can say they are from Harbin).
  *   **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — The author **strongly implies** that being born and raised in the main urban area is a **higher or more authentic form of local identity**, especially when mocking others for claiming it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **administrative affiliation (RL2)** to establish a **basic level of local identity** — being from the Harbin jurisdiction.
  *   However, they emphasize **birth and upbringing in the main urban area (RL3)** as the **true or more legitimate marker of being a ""local""**, suggesting a **hierarchical view of local identity** where administrative legitimacy is the foundation, but rootedness in the core urban area is superior.

肯定不算北京人啊，说话口音也不像，文化背景也不同,** RL4," The author is clearly **distinguishing someone from being considered a Beijinger** (北京人), based on two key observations: their **accent is not Beijing dialect** and they have a **different cultural background**. These are not just casual observations but are used as **criteria to judge whether someone belongs to the ""local"" group**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “说话口音也不像” (accent not like a Beijinger) → relates to **language and accent**, a strong indicator of **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  - “文化背景也不同” (different cultural background) → relates to **customs, cultural habits**, also fits **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  Both the **accent** and **cultural background** are being used **as criteria to exclude someone from being considered a local** (北京人). These are not just descriptors but are **functional in defining local identity** from the author's perspective.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly uses **linguistic and cultural markers** to judge local identity, and these are **endorsed as valid criteria** in the statement.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that to be considered a local (北京人), one should **speak with the local accent and share the local cultural background**. This aligns directly with:
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** — as both accent and cultural habits are used to judge whether someone is ""local"".

They reject the idea that claiming to be from Harbin elevates one's status and emphasize that identity should not be based on administrative convenience or perceived urban prestige. The author also stresses the importance of **authentic local identity** and critiques the social dynamics—especially on platforms like Douyin (抖音)—where people argue over who counts as a “real” local based on things like accent or place of origin.

  - ""我更要说我是双城人了"" – reaffirmation of local identity against imposed labels → **RL1**
  - ""没有觉得说是哈尔滨人能为我提升什么档次"" – rejection of symbolic hierarchy → **RL6**
  - ""每一个城市的发展都是由在本城市同生活奋斗的人一起共同努力的"" – identity tied to lived experience and contribution → **RL3**, **RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Central to the author’s argument. They emphasize personal identification with a specific place (双城), reject the broader label (哈尔滨), and frame identity as rooted in conventional local belonging rather than administrative or symbolic convenience.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** Mentioned but **not endorsed**—used to **critique** the idea that administrative classification alone should define identity.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Strongly endorsed. The author implies a deep-rooted connection to 双城, and their identity is shaped by where they grew up and where their family is from.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Mentioned as a **phenomenon** others use to distinguish locals, but the author **does not endorse** this as a valid criterion.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author **rejects** the idea that being from Harbin brings status or legitimacy, thus **not endorsing** this logic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1:** Strongly endorsed and central to the author’s identity claim.
  - **RL3:** Strongly endorsed through emphasis on family origin and upbringing.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author defines ""local identity"" through a combination of **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1)—insisting on identifying as 双城人 rather than 哈尔滨人—and **family historical rootedness** (RL3), emphasizing where they and their family are from. They reject administrative, linguistic, and symbolic status-based definitions, positioning authenticity and rootedness as the core of local identity.

周边县就是不是哈尔滨呀，我爸老家就是宾县，没有人认为宾县=哈尔滨，在那住的也会区分，而且开车要出城，开高速才能到，都说来哈尔滨和回宾县。至于呼兰阿城双城，更不是一个地方了。小时候坐火车到呼兰要一个小时。我姥姥家行政上属于黑河下面的市，但是从来不会认为这是黑河的一部分，都是各叫各的，我也不认为我去过黑河。只有市区才算是这个市啊。,RL1," *   The author is emphasizing a clear distinction between **core urban areas** and **surrounding counties or cities**, arguing that people do not equate these surrounding areas (e.g., Bin County, Hulan, Acheng, Shuangcheng) with the city of Harbin, even if they are administratively part of Harbin. The author also shares personal experiences (e.g., travel time, family background) to illustrate that **local identity is defined by a sense of belonging tied to the urban core**, not administrative boundaries or proximity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""没有人认为宾县=哈尔滨"" (No one thinks Bin County = Harbin) – suggests **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  *   - ""开车要出城，开高速才能到"" (You have to leave the city and take the expressway to get there) – implies **RL1**
  *   - ""都说来哈尔滨和回宾县"" (People say “come to Harbin” and “go back to Bin County”) – implies **RL1**
  *   - ""小时候坐火车到呼兰要一个小时"" (As a kid, it took an hour by train to get to Hulan) – supports **RL1**
  *   - ""我也不认为我去过黑河"" (I don’t think I’ve been to Heihe) – implies **RL1**
  *   - ""只有市区才算是这个市啊"" (Only the urban core counts as the city) – strongly implies **RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author repeatedly emphasizes that **local identity is not defined by administrative boundaries or physical proximity**, but by a **socially constructed mental map** of what counts as the city. The author rejects **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and instead supports **RL1**, using travel time, common usage of language, and personal perception to illustrate that only the urban core is perceived as the real city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Only **RL1** is clearly endorsed and used to define local identity in the text. The author consistently rejects administrative definitions (RL2) and instead emphasizes **socially conventional territorial identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author’s argument is that **local identity is shaped by shared perception and experience**, not legal or administrative definitions. This aligns directly with **RL1**, as the author describes how people mentally separate Bin County, Hulan, and even parts of Heihe from the core city of Harbin, using **common language, travel behavior, and mental maps** to reinforce this distinction.

9区12县都是哈尔滨……老哈尔滨人都认为早期的七区（还有被取消的动力区和太平区）五县，现在是哈尔滨市区主要包括道里区、南岗区、道外区、平房区、松北区、香坊区、呼兰区、阿城区、双城区。其他算郊县。所以啥哈尔滨人……唉，都是中国人，行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人。没必要,RL2," The author is making a point about the changing administrative boundaries of Harbin and how that affects the definition of who is a ""Harbin local."" They acknowledge that while the administrative scope has expanded (including many new districts and counties), **some people (especially older residents)** still hold a more traditional or historical view of what constitutes the core area of Harbin. However, the author ultimately **rejects this narrow view**, arguing that **everyone within the administrative boundary should be considered a Harbin local**, and emphasizes a more inclusive identity under the broader administrative framework.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of specific historical and current administrative divisions: “动力区和太平区” (former districts), “道里区、南岗区...” (current core districts), “9区12县” (current administrative structure).
  - Reference to **老哈尔滨人** (old Harbin people) who define local identity based on historical administrative boundaries.
  - Emphasis on **current administrative structure**: “行政区域内，全都是哈尔滨人.”
  - Implicit contrast between **historical identity** and **administrative legitimacy**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The reference to **老哈尔滨人** and traditional districts reflects **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — a socially rooted perception of local boundaries and identity.
  - The author contrasts this with the **current administrative definition**, which aligns with **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** — defining local identity based on formal administrative boundaries.
  - The author **resists** the RL1-based identity and **supports** RL2 as the correct or more inclusive way to define who is a local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the **administrative boundary** as the basis for defining local identity, thus supporting **RL2**.
  - The author **mentions** a socially conventional view (RL1) but **rejects it**, so it should **not be annotated** as an endorsed criterion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **administrative boundaries** (RL2) — not historical or socially conventional ones — should be used to define who is a local. This is the **core argument**.
  - Therefore, only **RL2** is endorsed and functionally used in the author’s argument.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL2"
都是，又不是不属于哈尔滨,RL1," *   The text ""都是，又不是不属于哈尔滨"" (literally: ""All are, yet not not-Harbin"") expresses a nuanced or conflicted perception of local identity in Harbin. The author seems to suggest that although certain people or areas may technically or socially be associated with Harbin, there is also a sense in which they are not fully accepted or recognized as part of the ""true"" local identity. This reflects an **implicit boundary-making** in defining who or what counts as ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase “不属于哈尔滨” (""not belong to Harbin"") suggests a **cognitive or social boundary** around local identity.
  *   The structure of the sentence implies a **socially conventional understanding** of who is considered local, even if not explicitly stated.
  *   There is no mention of administrative boundaries, hukou, family history, language, economic status, or environmental quality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase functions to **highlight a socially accepted or conventional boundary** of local identity — some people or areas may be in Harbin, but not *of* Harbin in the deeper, socially recognized sense.
  *   The author is **not resisting** this logic; rather, they are **acknowledging or subtly reinforcing** the conventional understanding of local identity that distinguishes between ""in name only"" and ""in identity truly"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not referring to administrative definitions, family roots, language, or economic factors.
  *   The author is **endorsing or reflecting a conventional, socially sedimented understanding of local identity boundaries** — that is, a socially conventional territorial identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text reflects **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — the author implies that there is a **socially accepted or conventional understanding** of who or what is considered truly “local” to Harbin, even if they are physically or administratively part of it.
  *   This supports the idea that **local identity is not just geographic, but socially and cognitively bounded** — a core aspect of RL1.

The author finds this logic illogical and even absurd, pointing out that if these areas are excluded, it's unclear which city they then belong to (e.g.,大庆 or 齐齐哈尔). The author is clearly **opposed to the idea of using rigid, exclusionary territorial definitions to determine who or what counts as ""local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author discusses the **socially conventional or emotional boundaries** of what counts as part of Harbin, and criticizes the idea of excluding certain districts or counties based on **traditional or emotional regional cognition**.
  *   **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — The author indirectly questions the **administrative归属 (affiliation)** of these areas, asking if excluded areas belong to大庆 or 齐齐哈尔, implying that the author believes administrative boundaries should be respected over subjective local perceptions.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL1** plays a **critical role** in the author's argument. The author is **opposing** the use of **emotionally or traditionally based territorial identity** to exclude certain areas from being considered part of Harbin. This shows that the author sees this as a **criterion being used by others**, which they **explicitly reject**.
  *   **RL2** plays a **supportive role** in the author’s argument. By questioning where excluded areas would administratively belong, the author is **implying that administrative boundaries should define归属**, even if not stated outright.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   **RL1** is **not endorsed** by the author — it is **explicitly criticized**.
  *   **RL2** is **implied as a more legitimate standard** than the socially conventional one, and thus is **endorsed by the author**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is arguing against the use of **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) to define who is a local. Instead, they **implicitly endorse** the **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) of city boundaries. Therefore, the **only RL criterion endorsed by the author** is **RL2**.

They **reject** these as valid criteria for determining who is truly ""local"", arguing instead for a more inclusive and grounded sense of belonging. Their own viewpoint is that **shared upbringing, coexistence in the same broader region (like大庆, Daqing), and mutual experience—not symbolic or administrative markers—define local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""口音腔调"" (accent/dialect) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - ""习惯"" (habits/customs) → RL4
  - ""市政惠民政策当作地域分界线"" (using municipal policies as regional boundaries) → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)

  - ""冰雪大世界售票规则不过是行政划分的产物"" (Ice Festival ticket rules are just administrative divisions) → RL2
  - ""五区四县同属一座城"" (five districts and four counties all belong to one city) → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - ""油田子弟和湿地农家的孩子都在磕头机旁长大"" (children of oilfield workers and wetland farmers grow up together around pump jacks) → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - ""文明尺度从不丈量户口本上的地址"" (civilization doesn't measure address on a hukou) → RL2 (implied rejection of administrative legitimacy)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL4 elements (accent, dialect, customs) are **criticized** by the author as **false or exclusionary markers of local identity**.
  - RL2 elements (administrative boundaries, policies, hukou) are also **explicitly rejected** as **arbitrary and inauthentic** bases for defining local belonging.
  - RL1 (""five districts and four counties as one city"") is **endorsed** by the author as a **broader, more inclusive regional identity**.
  - RL3 (""grew up together around pump jacks"") is used to **positively affirm a shared upbringing and lived experience** as the **true basis of local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only RL1 and RL3 are **endorsed** by the author as **valid criteria** for defining ""local identity"".
  - RL2 and RL4 are **explicitly resisted** and **not used to define ""local""** in the author's view.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is clearly present: the author affirms a broader, socially conventional territorial identity that includes ""five districts and four counties"" as part of one city.

None of the RL categories apply."," The author is **resisting the idea** of distinguishing between ""authentic"" and ""non-authentic"" Harbin locals. They argue that since the **price of housing in the city isn't significantly higher than in surrounding counties**, there's currently **no substantial basis for such a distinction**. The author implies that only when the **wealth gap becomes as large as in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou** would such distinctions make sense. Thus, the author is **rejecting the idea** that economic or residential factors should currently be used to define local identity in Harbin.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""正宗的哈尔滨人"" — touches on **local identity** and potentially relates to RL1, RL3, or RL4.
  - ""市里的房价也没比我周边县城贵多少"" — refers to **property prices** and **economic disparity**, which could relate to **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** or **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**.
  - ""贫富差距大到北上广那样再来分吧"" — clearly links **economic disparity** (as seen in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou) to the **possibility of defining local identity through economic status**, again pointing toward **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **not endorsing** the use of economic or property-based criteria to define local identity. Instead, they are **arguing against it**, saying that **such criteria only become relevant when there's a large wealth gap** like in major cities.
  - Therefore, although the text **mentions criteria related to RL5 and RL6**, it **does not endorse** them as valid for defining local identity **in the current context**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** any specific criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - They **reject** the idea of using economic or property-based criteria.
  - There is **no explicit or implicit endorsement** of **any** RL category to define local identity in Harbin at this time.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - Although economic disparity and housing prices are mentioned, they are **not used by the author as legitimate criteria** to define local identity.
  - The author **argues against** the legitimacy of such distinctions in the current context.
  - Therefore, **no RL category applies** based on the author’s own stance.

说嗯呐的不属于哈尔滨市里的,RL4," The author is making a clear distinction about identity and belonging, specifically stating that people who say ""嗯呐"" (a colloquial expression typical of Northeastern Mandarin dialects, especially associated with rural or non-Harbin urban speech) are **not considered part of Harbin city proper**. This is not just a linguistic observation—it is a **social boundary-drawing** statement, where the use of a specific linguistic feature is being used to **exclude** someone from the category of ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “说嗯呐的不属于哈尔滨市里的” — “those who say '嗯呐' are not considered part of Harbin city.” The key element here is the use of **linguistic behavior** (specifically dialect or speech pattern) as a **marker of local identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase “说嗯呐” (using the expression 嗯呐) is being used as a **litmus test** or **criterion** for determining whether someone is considered a true local of Harbin. The author is not just describing a linguistic trait—they are **using it to define the boundaries of local identity**. This is a **symbolic boundary** being drawn using **language**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is clearly endorsing the idea that **linguistic behavior** (specifically dialect or speech pattern) is a valid or commonly used standard for judging who counts as a local. This is not a resisted or negated criterion—it is the **main point** of the sentence.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author contrasts this with other areas like Old Daowai and Central Street, which are described as either **ethnically local centers** or **secondary commercial zones**, respectively.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Mentions of ""museum roundabout as the oldest city center"", ""Central Street as a secondary entertainment/commercial area"", and ""Old Daowai as the local people's center"" suggest conventional mental maps and symbolic meanings of different urban zones.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author notes that ""the provincial and municipal governments were originally located here"", which implies administrative centrality and legitimacy.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The reference to ""Old Daowai being the gathering area for old Harbin residents"" implies a historical settlement pattern and local rootedness.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** The emphasis on the **railway as the reason for the city’s rise** and the centrality of areas near the railway implies that **railway-related development and occupation** shaped the city and its core.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1** plays a central role in defining what the author considers the ""real"" center of Harbin, based on **historical perception and symbolic meaning**, not just physical infrastructure.
  - **RL2** supports the claim that the Museum Roundabout was the **administrative and symbolic heart** of the city.
  - **RL3** is used to **contrast the Russian-built urban core with the local Chinese settlement area**, showing that ""local"" can have different meanings.
  - **RL7** supports the argument that the city's **economic and occupational origins (railway)** determined where the center should be.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  All four RL elements are used to **construct and support the author’s claim** about where the real ""center"" of Harbin is, and how different areas represent different kinds of ""local"" identity or function.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL1** to argue that the Museum Roundabout is the conventional center, symbolically and historically.
  - **RL2** reinforces this by linking it to the placement of government institutions.
  - **RL3** shows that Old Daowai is the center for ethnically local people, though not the original urban core.

The author also expresses frustration with the inefficiency of Beijing’s transportation system and how it impacts quality of life.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of urban development patterns: old city vs. new districts (哈西 vs. 群力),江北, city center vs. outskirts → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**
  - Implicit assumption that certain areas (哈西, 群力) are or become more ""local core"" based on development and popularity → **RL1**
  - Reference to transportation convenience as a reason to live in the city center → **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**
  - Comparison of travel time and accessibility to highlight how urban structure affects lifestyle → **RL5**
  - Implicit judgment that certain areas (e.g., city center) have historically been more desirable or ""central"" to local identity → **RL1**
  - Mention of how transportation improvements change perceptions of centrality and local value → **RL5**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Territorial Identity):** The author is comparing different districts in Harbin and their evolving status. This implies a mental map or perception of which areas are ""core"" or ""local,"" and how this perception changes over time. The author uses this to contrast with the current situation in Beijing.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability):** The author emphasizes how transportation and accessibility used to make city center living more valuable, but now, due to sprawl and better connectivity, this advantage has diminished. This is central to the author’s point about how ""local"" value or desirability is shifting.

  - The author **does endorse** the idea that functional factors like transportation and accessibility define or redefine the value and desirability of a ""local"" area → **RL5**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1:** The author implicitly defines which areas are ""local"" or central based on historical development patterns (哈西 was first, then 群力,江北 not yet developed). This reflects a socially conventional understanding of which areas are core.

  - ""那时候合肥人口才一百来万"" → context, not directly defining local identity.
  - ""我上学是工大附中"" + ""合肥工业大学就在现在南一环那"" + ""大学墙外就是农村田地"" → suggests **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, as the author describes a mental map of the city and implies a distinction between core and peripheral areas.
  - ""我们小时候爬墙过去炸菜地，趴祖坟"" → anecdotal, not directly defining local identity.
  - ""就那时候我们还被人说是郊区的"" → reinforces **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**.

合肥一直都是移民城市，我93年到合肥，从幼儿园到高中，班上所谓纯正的合肥人就没几个，基本都是90年代跟着父母来的，都是普通话交流，合肥话都不会讲，你这些本地同事基本也应该是小时候移民过来的为主，就像我们这些人在别人看都是本地的，因为幼儿园就来了，但是其实也不是土生土长的,"RL3, RL4"," The author is reflecting on the nature of ""local identity"" in Hefei, emphasizing that it is a city shaped by migration. They suggest that many who are perceived as ""locals"" today are actually people who migrated to Hefei as children (often during early education), and therefore, the concept of being a ""pure local"" is rare or even illusory. The author implies that growing up in the city from an early age (e.g., kindergarten) contributes significantly to being seen—and seeing oneself—as ""local"", even if not born there.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - *“合肥一直都是移民城市”* → Suggests a historical pattern of migration, implying that the concept of “local” is not rooted in long-term rootedness.
  - *“我93年到合肥，从幼儿园到高中”* → Indicates that early arrival and upbringing in the city contributes to local identity.
  - *“合肥话都不会讲，普通话交流”* → Implies that language/cultural assimilation plays a role in local identity perception.
  - *“这些本地同事……小时候移民过来的为主”* → Suggests that many perceived ""locals"" are actually migrants from childhood.
  - *“幼儿园就来了，但是其实也不是土生土长的”* → Emphasizes the distinction between being raised locally and being born there.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** to argue that growing up in the city from early childhood (e.g., kindergarten) is a key criterion for being seen as ""local"", even if not born there.
  - The author also implies **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** by noting that many long-term residents do not even speak the local dialect, suggesting that linguistic assimilation (e.g., using Mandarin) contributes to being accepted as ""local"".
  - The author **resists** the idea of **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as they point out that most people seen as ""locals"" are not actually from the area by birth or family history.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** RL3 and RL4 as criteria for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **does not endorse** RL1 or RL2 as valid markers of local identity, suggesting they are outdated or inaccurate in the context of Hefei.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is used to argue that growing up in Hefei from childhood is sufficient to be considered ""local"", even without being born there or having local family roots.
  - **RL4** is implied in the idea that not speaking the local dialect doesn’t disqualify someone from being seen as local, suggesting that cultural assimilation (or lack thereof) is a relevant, though perhaps not definitive, factor.

发展起来的晚，年纪大一点的普遍受文化教育水平不高，很多拆迁户（没有歧视的意思，但确实老年人较多 素质确实有待提高）,** RL6," The author is describing a **social phenomenon** related to a group of people—likely older, with lower levels of education, and including many demolition resettlement households (拆迁户)—who, according to the author, are perceived as having lower overall quality. While the author explicitly states that there is **no discriminatory intent**, the underlying implication is that these characteristics are **linked to a judgment about the social or cultural quality of a group**, which the author uses to **evaluate or distinguish the ""local"" population or residential area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""年纪大一点的普遍受文化教育水平不高""** (older people generally have low educational levels) → potentially related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as it indirectly reflects social status and generational characteristics.
  - **""很多拆迁户""** (many demolition resettlement households) → strongly linked to **RL6**, as resettlement often involves changes in social and economic status, and may imply a lack of deep-rooted social or economic integration.
  - **""老年人较多 素质确实有待提高""** (many elderly people, whose quality needs improvement) → again points to **RL6**, where ""quality"" (素质) is used as a **criterion to evaluate people's status or legitimacy within a local community**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  These elements are used to **describe a group of people who are implicitly contrasted with a more ""ideal"" or ""authentic"" local population**. Although the author denies any discriminatory intent, they are **evaluating the local demographic structure** using **social and economic characteristics**—particularly **educational level and personal quality (素质)**—which are **indirect indicators of social status and integration**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is not explicitly defining who counts as a ""local"", but they are **implicitly evaluating the ""quality"" of a local population**, especially in the context of urban development and resettlement. The key criteria—educational level, age, and personal quality—are **used to judge or assess the social value or legitimacy of certain groups**, aligning with **RL6**, which concerns **social rootedness, status, and economic symbolism**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is evaluating the **social quality of a local population**, particularly in the context of **demolition resettlement and generational differences**, using **educational level and personal素质 (quality)** as **implicit criteria**. These are **indicators of social rootedness and status**, and are used to **assess the authenticity or value of a local group**.

还有交通特别乱，机动车从不让行人，电动车逆行，到处乱窜不遵守交通规则,N/A," The author is complaining about the chaotic traffic conditions, emphasizing that motor vehicles do not yield to pedestrians, and that electric bikes often ride against traffic and violate traffic rules generally.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text discusses traffic and rule-breaking behavior, but does not mention any criteria related to defining ""local people"" or evaluating the scope or quality of a ""local"" area. There is no indication that the author is using traffic behavior or rule-breaking as a standard for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The description of traffic chaos serves to express frustration or dissatisfaction with the urban environment. However, it is not being used to define who is or isn't a local person, nor is it used to evaluate the legitimacy, boundaries, or quality of a ""local"" area from the author’s perspective.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author does not use traffic behavior or rule compliance as a basis to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the value or scope of local areas, **no RL criteria are applicable**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  There is no match with any RL category because the text does not present any logic or standard the author uses to define ""local identity"" or to judge the quality or scope of a ""local"" area.

南二环包河区政务东那边，薛河地铁站附近，比如信达的房子和绿地的房子，大概2万左右,N/A," The author is describing a real estate inquiry or observation, focusing on specific housing options near the Xuehe Metro Station in the Baohe District, particularly properties from developers such as China Fortune (信达) and Greenland (绿地), with a price around 20,000 RMB per square meter. The text primarily discusses property values and locations but **does not explicitly or implicitly define who is considered a ""local"" person** or what makes a place a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  There are references to:
  - **Location**: ""南二环包河区政务东"" (southeast of Baohe District, near the southern Second Ring Road).
  - **Specific place names**: ""薛河地铁站附近"" (near Xuehe Metro Station).
  - **Property developers and pricing**: ""信达的房子和绿地的房子，大概2万左右"" (China Fortune and Greenland houses, around 20,000 RMB).
  
  These elements could potentially relate to RL1 (territorial identity), RL5 (livability and environmental quality), or RL6 (economic symbolism), but we must assess whether they are used to **define ""local identity"" or evaluate ""local"" areas**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The location and place names are used to **pinpoint a real estate area**, not to define or evaluate ""local identity"".
  - The mention of developers and pricing primarily serves to **describe property value and investment context**, not to assess who is ""local"" or what makes an area ""local"".
  - There is **no indication** that the author is using these elements to define or judge local identity, nor is there any **implicit or explicit endorsement** of criteria for ""localness"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **not making an argument** about local identity. The text is **not evaluative** in terms of who is considered local or what makes a place more or less ""local"". It is **descriptive and transactional**, focusing on real estate details.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL categories apply because:
  - There is **no discussion of identity markers** (RL3, RL4).
  - There is **no reference to administrative boundaries or hukou** (RL2).
  - There is **no evaluation of what constitutes a ""local"" area** based on symbolic or social territorial logic (RL1).
  - There is **no link between livability or economic status and the definition of ""local""** (RL5, RL6).
  - There is **no mention of occupation or occupational symbolism** (RL7).

They also imply that these criteria are effective when one has enough exposure to diverse groups of people.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""庐阳区读书长大的"" (grew up studying in Luyang District):** RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - **""口音最容易分辨的"" (accent is the easiest to tell):** RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)

  - **""南方人北方人...细分到周边两三个省份"" (distinguishing between Southerners, Northerners, and even细分到周边两三个省份):** RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3** establishes the author's own local identity claim — growing up in a specific area — which gives them perceived authority to speak about local identity criteria.
  - **RL4** is the **main functional criterion** the author proposes for identifying locals: accent is the most straightforward, and appearance is a more refined way to distinguish people’s regional backgrounds.
  - **RL1** underpins the assumption that regional differences (e.g., between provinces) are socially meaningful and recognizable, and that people can be categorized into these regions based on the above cues.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3** is endorsed and used to frame the author's own legitimacy in making these observations.
  - **RL4** is clearly endorsed as a key criterion for identifying local or regional identity.
  - **RL1** is implicitly endorsed through the author’s belief that people can be categorized into fine-grained regional groups, indicating a conventional understanding of territorial identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that growing up in a specific local area (RL3) gives one the ability to recognize subtle regional identities based on **accent and appearance** (RL4), which they use to distinguish **regional boundaries and local affiliations** (RL1). These criteria form the basis of their understanding of how local identity can be recognized and differentiated.

啊？我03年的，我妹12年的，我们一家人平时交流都是合肥土话周围的亲戚基本上也都讲合肥话,"**  
RL4"," The author is emphasizing that their family, including themselves and their younger sibling (born in 2003 and 2012 respectively), as well as surrounding relatives, communicate in the local Hefei dialect. This implies a strong cultural and linguistic continuity within the family and community, used to affirm their local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Use of the local dialect (""合肥土话"", ""合肥话"") — points to linguistic rootedness.
  - Family generational consistency in using the local dialect — suggests cultural rootedness and heritage.
  - Relatives also using the local dialect — reinforces a shared cultural-linguistic identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The use of the local dialect by the author, their sibling, and relatives functions as a **key identity marker** that distinguishes them as locals. It supports the author's implicit claim that speaking the local dialect is a core aspect of being considered a local person in this context.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The linguistic use of the local dialect is clearly **endorsed and affirmed** by the author as a characteristic of their family and relatives, and thus functions as a **criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author implicitly defines local identity through the use of the local dialect and shared linguistic practices within the family and extended relatives.

所以这和小黑子有什么关系？房价网上查不到？,None," The author is questioning the relevance of a certain topic (possibly related to ""little blackies"" or critics) to housing prices, suggesting that housing prices are something that can be easily looked up online. The author appears to be dismissive of the connection being made by others, and is not making a substantive argument about what defines a ""local person"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text contains no explicit or implicit discussion of:
  - Territorial identity
  - Administrative legitimacy
  - Family or individual history
  - Cultural or linguistic traits
  - Livability or environmental quality
  - Social roots or economic status
  - Occupational symbolism

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  There are no RL elements present in the text. The author is not constructing or endorsing any standard for defining ""local identity"". The mention of housing prices is not linked to any evaluative or definitional standard for ""local"" people or areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author is not making any argument about ""local identity"", and no RL elements are present, nothing qualifies for annotation.

哈哈，新来的都在疯狂踩老城区，因为他们恰好赶上的房价最高的那一波,RL6," *   The author is making a sarcastic or ironic observation about newcomers who are ""stepping on"" (disparaging or looking down upon) the old city area. The reason given is that these newcomers ""just happened"" to arrive during the peak of the housing price cycle.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""新来的"" (newcomers) — implies a distinction between ""new"" and ""old"" residents.
  *   ""疯狂踩老城区"" (frantically stepping on the old city area) — suggests a negative evaluation of the old city by newcomers.
  *   ""房价最高的那一波"" (the highest housing price wave) — links the newcomers' judgment of the area to economic conditions, specifically real estate prices.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""疯狂踩老城区"" indicates that the author perceives a value judgment being made by newcomers about the old city area.
  *   The reason given — ""房价最高的那一波"" — is used to **undermine the legitimacy** of that judgment. The author is implying that the newcomers are not making an objective or culturally grounded evaluation, but are instead influenced by the high property prices they encountered.
  *   The author is **critiquing** the logic used by newcomers to define or judge ""local"" areas, suggesting that their standard (housing prices) is shallow or misinformed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** the standard of ""high housing prices"" as a valid way to judge local areas.
  *   The author is **not defining what makes someone 'local'** but is instead **mocking** the criteria used by newcomers.
  *   However, the text **implies that the author believes economic status or real estate value is being used by others as a standard**, and the author **does not accept this**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The key RL category involved here is **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.
  *   The author is **implicitly critiquing** the idea that high housing prices (or economic value) can be used to judge the quality or authenticity of a ""local"" area.

The author also mentions that dining out can be costly in both places depending on the venue, and points out that Hefei’s real estate prices are relatively lower than in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The author lived in Hefei’s government district about ten years ago, shopped there, and visited places like Swan Lake and MixC Century City, indicating that Hefei’s consumption level is not necessarily low.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Mentions of **consumption patterns** (e.g., dining out, buying pork ribs, visiting commercial centers) and **housing prices**.
  *   Reference to **geographical areas** like the government district, Swan Lake, MixC Century City.
  *   Personal experience living in Hefei.
  *   Comparison of **economic factors** between cities.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **Consumption and housing price comparisons** serve to challenge the assumption that Hefei is significantly cheaper than Shanghai.
  *   The **mention of specific locations in Hefei** and the author’s personal experience living there are used to support the author’s argument from firsthand knowledge.
  *   However, **none of the economic or consumption comparisons are used to define ""local identity"" or judge who counts as a ""local"" person** — they are used to compare **quality of life or cost of living**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The only RL-related element is the author’s **personal experience living in Hefei’s government district**, which implies a **local identity through lived experience**.
  *   This supports **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** — the author lived in Hefei and participated in local life, which implies a form of **local belonging**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author lived in Hefei for several years, frequented local places like Swan Lake and MixC Century City, and shopped locally (e.g., buying pork ribs). This **personal history and integration into local life** aligns with **RL3**, as it reflects **individual growth and experience forming a basis for local identity**.

They compare Hefei unfavorably to other cities, citing traffic congestion and chaotic road conditions involving electric scooters as key reasons for no longer wanting to stay. The text implies a **change in the perceived quality of life** in Hefei, which affects the author's emotional connection to it.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长合肥人"" → Suggests a long-standing personal and possibly generational connection to Hefei → **RL3**
  - ""14年以前根本舍不得离开合肥"" → Implies emotional attachment and rootedness → **RL1**
  - ""越来越不爱在合肥待着了"" → Indicates a shift in emotional connection → **RL1**
  - ""每年想办法溜出去给自己放假"" → Suggests avoidance of Hefei, seeking better experiences elsewhere → **RL5**
  - ""感觉每个城市都比合肥新鲜"" → Implies Hefei has become less appealing or livable compared to other cities → **RL5**
  - ""没有繁杂的交通环境，不用走在过个马路和各种电瓶车碰撞"" → Directly links dissatisfaction to traffic and environmental quality → **RL5**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The phrase ""土生土长合肥人"" establishes the author's deep-rooted, lifelong connection to Hefei. This gives weight to their emotional shift — it’s not an outsider’s critique, but a native’s disillusionment.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The emotional shift from attachment to detachment reflects a change in how the author perceives their territorial identity and affiliation with Hefei. It's not just about physical residence but about belonging.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author’s current negative view of Hefei is based on traffic, road safety, and environmental chaos. These are not just complaints but are directly tied to their changing sense of whether Hefei is a place they want to live in — thus influencing their self-identification as a ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3:** Endorsed. The author identifies as a native, and this rootedness is central to their perspective.
  - **RL1:** Endorsed. The author’s emotional shift reflects a change in their territorial identity and sense of belonging.
  - **RL5:** Endorsed. The author evaluates Hefei negatively based on livability factors and compares it to other cities, indicating that these factors influence their sense of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is a native of Hefei (RL3), who once had a strong emotional connection to the city (RL1), but now feels increasingly alienated due to deteriorating environmental and livability conditions (RL5). This shift affects their sense of local identity and their desire to remain in the city.

**Output:** RL1, RL3, RL5"
合肥土著人，感觉合肥的名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城以后，面积大了不少，交通也在变的便捷，相应的民生政策并没有积极跟上，希望越来越好，做到真正的宜居,RL1," *   The author identifies as a Hefei native (""合肥土著人"") and expresses a reflective viewpoint on how the city's identity and scope have evolved (""名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城""), which implies a shift in public perception and territorial identity. They note that the city has expanded (""面积大了不少"") and that transportation has improved (""交通也在变的便捷""), but they express concern that the民生 policy (social welfare policies) have not kept pace. The author hopes for future improvement toward becoming a truly livable city (""做到真正的宜居"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""合肥土著人"" — may imply **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as the author identifies as a native.
  *   ""名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城"" — indicates a shift in how the city is symbolically defined, potentially implying **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  *   ""面积大了不少"" — suggests a change in the perceived geographical scope of the city, relevant to **RL1**.
  *   ""交通也在变的便捷"" — relates to functional livability, potentially **RL5**, but only if directly linked to local identity or evaluation of the city.
  *   ""民生政策并没有积极跟上"" — discusses policy shortcoming; not directly an RL unless tied to defining ""local people"".
  *   ""做到真正的宜居"" — again, links to **RL5**, if the author is using livability as a standard to evaluate the ""quality"" of a local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""合肥土著人"" — establishes the author’s personal rootedness, which implies **RL3** is in the background, but it is not used as a **criterion for defining others as local**, only as self-identification.
  *   ""名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城"" — this is about **changing symbolic identity and perception**, which plays a **core role** in how the city and its people are seen socially — directly supports **RL1**.
  *   ""面积大了不少"" — this is a **spatial perception shift**, also playing a role in **RL1**, reinforcing how the city’s territorial identity is expanding.
  *   ""交通也在变的便捷"" — functional improvement, but the author links it to the city’s **evolving identity**, not to who is “local” — potentially **RL5**, but only indirectly.
  *   ""做到真正的宜居"" — the author uses this as a **normative standard** for how the city should develop, and possibly how it should be evaluated — again, **RL5**, but not directly tied to defining ""local people"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is most focused on the **evolving perception and symbolic identity** of Hefei — how the city is **redefined in people’s minds**, and how its **territory and image have expanded**. This is the **core of their argument**.
  *   Therefore, **RL1** is clearly endorsed as a standard for defining and evaluating the city and its local identity.
  *   **RL5** is mentioned, but not as a standard for defining ""local people"" — rather as a **goal for the city's development**.
  *   **RL3** is present in self-identification but not used as a **criterion for judging others**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author discusses the **symbolic redefinition** of the city and the **mental map shift** — from a historical figure-based identity (""包拯故里"") to a broader environmental and spatial one (""大湖名城""). This directly corresponds to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  *   The author implies that the **new identity includes a larger area** and is **changing people’s perception**, which is central to how ""local"" is defined and experienced.
  *   Other elements (like transportation and livability) are mentioned, but **not used as criteria for defining local identity**, so they are not annotated.

合肥的人口这几年聚集太多了，整体管理还是有很大脱节的，比如停车问题就很糟糕。而且本地人也不少的，但和深圳不一样，本地人很少吃到房价上涨带来的资产增加，跟外地人组成新合肥人相比，竞争力相对不足,RL6," The author is expressing concern about the rapid population growth in Hefei and the resulting urban management challenges (e.g., parking issues). They also note that while there are many local residents, unlike in Shenzhen, these locals haven't benefited much from rising housing prices. As a result, they are less competitive compared to the ""new Hefei people"" composed of outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""本地人"" (local people) vs. ""外地人组成新合肥人"" (new Hefei people composed of outsiders) – implies a distinction in local identity.
  - ""很少吃到房价上涨带来的资产增加"" (rarely benefited from asset increases due to rising housing prices) – suggests economic status or asset ownership plays a role in identity or competitiveness.
  - Comparison with Shenzhen implies a different standard or model for local identity elsewhere.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The distinction between ""本地人"" and ""新合肥人"" is central to the author’s point — it shows that traditional locals are being economically outpaced by new arrivals.
  - The author implies that **economic benefit from real estate** and **asset ownership in the local area** are important markers of status or competitiveness within the local identity framework.
  - The author is not defining locals based on administrative, cultural, or rootedness criteria, but rather through economic outcomes and local asset ownership.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not** endorse or use RL1 (territorial identity), RL2 (administrative legitimacy), RL3 (family history), RL4 (cultural-linguistic), RL5 (livability), or RL7 (occupational symbolism) to define ""local identity"".
  - The author **does imply** that **economic status and asset ownership in the local area** (specifically real estate and the benefits derived from it) affect the **authenticity or competitiveness** of one's local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as the author contrasts traditional locals with new arrivals who are more economically empowered, suggesting that **owning property and benefiting from its appreciation is tied to a more ""authentic"" or competitive form of local identity**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

有一说一之前去合肥，当地的阜阳口音是真的正宗啊,RL4," The author is expressing an observation and a subtle evaluation that during a recent trip to Hefei, they noticed that the local Fuyang accent was ""really authentic"" or ""genuine."" This implies that the presence and quality of the local dialect serve as a marker of local identity or at least a perceived authenticity of local culture.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “阜阳口音是真的正宗” (the Fuyang accent is really authentic), which clearly relates to linguistic features and their role in defining or recognizing local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of the Fuyang accent being ""正宗"" (authentic) plays a role in affirming a cultural-linguistic distinction — suggesting that the local dialect is a notable or even defining characteristic of the local people in that area. The author appears to endorse or at least acknowledge this as a meaningful and authentic marker of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does not resist or negate the importance of the dialect; rather, they highlight its authenticity, implying that it contributes to a sense of local identity or cultural distinctiveness. This aligns with the use of linguistic features to distinguish insiders from outsiders or to affirm local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This fits within **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author implicitly endorses the idea that linguistic traits (specifically the Fuyang dialect) are a meaningful criterion for recognizing local identity or cultural authenticity in the area.

Output: RL4"
我老家也是大圩的欸，不过好像大圩拆迁房的房价并不高吧，是什么葡萄家园吧,(no RL category applies)," The author begins by expressing a shared origin — ""my hometown is also in Da Wei (大圩)"" — indicating a potential connection to local identity. However, the subsequent part of the sentence shifts focus to property prices of ""demolition houses in Da Wei"" and mentions a housing estate name — ""Pu Tao Jia Yuan (葡萄家园)"" — which appears to be a factual or slightly evaluative remark about real estate value. There is no explicit or implicit assertion about what defines a ""local person"" or how ""local identity"" should be judged. The author is not proposing or endorsing any standard of local identity; rather, they are making a passing observation about property prices in a place they are originally from.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mention of hometown origin — could relate to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**.
  * Mention of demolition housing and property prices — could relate to **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** or **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""my老家 is also Da Wei"" implies a personal connection to the area, potentially invoking **RL3**, but the author does not use this to argue for or define what makes someone a ""local"" — it's more of a personal note.
  * The mention of property prices and housing estate names does not serve to define ""local identity"" or evaluate the area's local status; it's more of a factual or evaluative comment on housing value, not on identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * No RL criteria are being explicitly or implicitly endorsed by the author to define ""local identity"".
  * The author is not constructing or endorsing any logic to judge who is ""local"" or to evaluate the ""local"" nature of an area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * While the author mentions origin and property prices, neither is used to define or evaluate ""local identity"" in the way required by the task.
  * There is no assertion about identity boundaries, administrative legitimacy, rootedness, cultural traits, quality of life as identity criteria, social capital, or occupational symbolism.

**Step 6: Output Result**

别逗了，，他们家父母和她都是45，确实有小户型60的，但是有些是自己掏钱钱买的平方，给你60又怎么样，，多15平方也就多8万来块钱修不修好有个屁关系，房价在这里，根本没人买，发财个毛啊，真靠每个月租房补助能有多少钱，我朋友大铺头拆迁，到现在房子也没拿，每个月人头补助才几个钱，这些钱不会在你这就是巨款吧。,"**  
RL6"," The author is expressing skepticism and frustration regarding the benefits of being involved in urban redevelopment or being considered part of the ""local"" group through property ownership or family ties. The tone is dismissive of the idea that owning property or receiving compensation equates to financial gain or local status. The author implies that these factors do not significantly impact one's status or wealth, and questions the assumption that such benefits are substantial.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of property ownership (""小户型60的"", ""自己掏钱钱买的平方"") relates potentially to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.
  - Reference to family (""他们家父母和她都是45"") may imply a generational or familial connection, potentially linking to **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - Discussion of financial compensation (""租房补助"", ""人头补助"") and property value (""房价在这里，根本没人买"") also ties into **RL6**, as it reflects economic symbolism and the perceived value or lack thereof tied to property and compensation.
  - No strong references to cultural-linguistic identity, administrative boundaries, or territorial identity are present.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL6** elements (property ownership, compensation, economic value) are used to **undermine** the idea that being a local or being connected to redevelopment equates to financial benefit or social status. The author is **critical** of the assumption that owning property or receiving compensation makes someone better off.
  - **RL3** is **not strongly endorsed** by the author; the mention of family ties seems more descriptive than evaluative in terms of local identity. The author does not affirm family history as a basis for local identity but rather questions the value of the benefits associated with it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL6** is used in a way that reflects the author’s **core viewpoint**—that economic benefits tied to local status or property are **overestimated or insignificant**. The author **does not endorse** family history or cultural identity as criteria for local identity.
  - The author is **not affirming** any positive standard for defining ""local identity"" but is **critiquing** the economic assumptions often tied to it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is **implicitly rejecting** the idea that property ownership or financial compensation is a valid or meaningful marker of local identity. This **still counts as a reference to RL6**, as it reflects the **author’s view on the invalidity of economic symbolism** in defining local identity.
  - Therefore, **RL6** is the only RL category that is functionally relevant and endorsed (in a critical or negating way) in the text.

**Output:**

说实话，我们这一代当时强制普及普通话，天天做这个黑板报，我们能听懂合肥话，但是说出来总是怪怪的，我妈还问我是哪里的口音,"**  
RL4"," The author is reflecting on their personal experience of growing up during a time when Mandarin was being forcefully promoted in education and public life. While they can understand the local dialect (Hefei dialect), they feel a sense of disfluency or disconnect when trying to speak it. Their mother even questions the author’s accent, implying that it doesn’t quite fit the local pattern—perhaps suggesting a lack of deep local identity due to linguistic shift.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “能听懂合肥话，但是说出来总是怪怪的” (can understand Hefei dialect, but speaking it feels awkward): This points to a **linguistic disconnect**, which is a potential **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** indicator.
  - “我妈还问我是哪里的口音” (my mom even asked me where my accent is from): This implies that the author's speech doesn't align with the local norm, further reinforcing the **linguistic identity boundary**, again pointing to **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is expressing a personal identity tension—being from Hefei (or at least culturally close to it), but not fully aligned with the local dialect, which creates a sense of linguistic and possibly cultural distance. This suggests that **language is being used as a marker of local identity**, and the author implicitly acknowledges its importance in defining who is considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not oppose the idea that dialect proficiency is a marker of local identity; rather, they express a personal experience of lacking that marker. This implies that the author **implicitly accepts** the linguistic criterion as valid for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The key RL category here is **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author reflects on how dialect proficiency (or lack thereof) affects their sense of belonging and is perceived by others (e.g., the mother’s question about the accent).

**Output:**  
RL4"
合肥四个行政区啊，为什么合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区,"**  
RL1"," The author is **questioning or critiquing** the common tendency among ""Hefei people"" to refer to the High-tech Zone (高新区) as an administrative district, implying that this reflects a **social perception or mental map** of local identity and area classification that goes beyond formal administrative boundaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区” — indicating a **socially conventional perception** of area identity, where高新区 is treated as if it were an administrative district, even if not officially so.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  The author is not endorsing the administrative status of 高新区 but is pointing out that **socially and cognitively**, many locals treat it as such. This reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** — how people mentally categorize and talk about areas, which may differ from official boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author highlights a **social perception or mental categorization** of高新区 as if it were an administrative district, which is a **socially conventional way of defining local areas** — even if not formally correct.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is describing a **socially accepted or conventional way of identifying or categorizing local areas**, which influences how locals mentally define ""local"" territory.

**Output:**

因为高新区有自己的学区啊，而且管委会管理行政事务，居民办事也不去蜀山区啊，房产证也是高新区，就一个身份证是蜀山区,"** RL2, RL5"," The author is emphasizing that高新区 (High-tech Zone) has its own distinct administrative and residential identity — including its own school district system, administrative management (via a管委会 - Management Committee), and property certificates — which functionally separates it from 蜀山区 (Shushan District), except for the fact that the ID card registration (身份证) still officially belongs to Shushan District. The author is implying that高新区 should be seen as a distinct ""local"" area, separate from Shushan, despite the ID card classification.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""高新区有自己的学区"" –高新区 has its own school district system. → **RL5** (Functional Livability – education infrastructure)
  - ""管委会管理行政事务"" – administrative affairs are managed by the Management Committee → **RL2** (Administrative legitimacy)
  - ""居民办事也不去蜀山区"" – residents don't go to Shushan District for administrative services → **RL2**
  - ""房产证也是高新区"" – property ownership certificates are issued under高新区 → **RL2**
  - ""身份证是蜀山区"" – ID card still belongs to Shushan → **RL2** (Contrastive use of administrative legitimacy)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is building a case that高新区 functions as an independent administrative and residential unit — with its own school district, administrative management, and property system — which implies it should be recognized as a separate ""local"" area.
  - The contrast between the property certificate (高新区) and ID card (蜀山区) is used to highlight the mismatch between administrative recognition and functional reality.
  - The school district and administrative functions are not just described as facts; they are used to argue for高新区's distinct ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly supports the idea that高新区 should be seen as a separate ""local"" area based on its administrative structure and functional independence (RL2).
  - The school district and property system are used as evidence of高新区’s local legitimacy (RL5 and RL2).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author uses高新区’s own administrative system and property registration to argue for its local identity, contrasting it with the outdated ID card registration under Shushan.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The mention of高新区 having its own school district implies that高新区 is functionally self-sufficient and thus should be considered a legitimate local residential area.

没说不宜居 瑶海庐阳都很宜居 我在瑶海生活五六年 买东西真的很方便 但是发展比较好的区确实包河和蜀山更强些,N/A," *   The author is expressing that瑶海 (Yaohai) and 庐阳 (Luyang) are both livable districts where they have lived for five or six years and find convenient for daily needs. However, they also note that 包河 (Baohe) and 蜀山 (Shushan) are more developed. This suggests a nuanced view of different districts' qualities, but the core point is not about defining ""local identity"" but rather about evaluating the **livability and development level** of different areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key elements in the text include:
      *   ""瑶海庐阳都很宜居"" – Yaohai and Luyang are livable.
      *   ""我在瑶海生活五六年"" – Lived in Yaohai for 5–6 years.
      *   ""买东西真的很方便"" – Convenient for shopping.
      *   ""发展比较好的区确实包河和蜀山更强些"" – Baohe and Shushan are more developed.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of ""宜居"" (livable), ""买东西方便"" (convenient shopping), and ""发展比较好的区"" (more developed districts) all point to **functional livability and environmental quality** (RL5), but they are used to **compare the development and convenience of different districts**, not to define who is ""local"" or to establish criteria for local identity.
  *   The author lived in Yaohai for several years, which might hint at **individual growth history** (RL3), but this is not used to define ""local identity"" — it's just a statement of residence duration.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not** use any of these observations to define ""local people"" or to draw boundaries around local identity.
  *   The discussion is about **quality of life and development levels**, not about **who counts as local**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although RL5 elements are present, they are not used to define ""local identity"" or to judge who is a local. The text lacks any criteria that the author uses to distinguish locals from non-locals.

The author implies that while the area has some urban characteristics (like metro access and产证), it lacks broader livability appeal or high-end facilities relevant to the general population.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * **""有地铁1号线 三号线 四号线""** – RL5 (mentions of multiple metro lines indicating functional livability)

  * **""至于后期的五星级酒店和普通人也没太大关系""** – RL5 (evaluation of livability and its relevance to general population)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **RL5** elements to evaluate the area’s functional livability and environmental quality, suggesting that while some infrastructure (like metro lines) is present, the overall environment and relevance of high-end facilities to ordinary people are lacking. This supports the author’s view that the area is only partially developed or livable.
  * **RL2** (""市区产证"") is used to affirm the area’s administrative urban classification, which the author contrasts with its actual quality of life, implying that administrative status doesn’t necessarily equate to a high-quality local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses **RL2**, **RL5**, and **RL6** to evaluate the area’s status as a ""local"" space, especially in terms of how administrative recognition, livability, and economic structure collectively shape its identity or value as a ""local"" area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author acknowledges that the area is classified as a downtown area based on产证, which is an administrative indicator of its status.

The comparison to Shenzhen is used to emphasize that a special economic zone doesn't represent the entire country (or, by analogy, that Jingwu District doesn't represent the whole city or have standalone status). The parenthetical note also reinforces that locals still refer to ""天鹅湖"" (Swan Lake) as part of Shushan District, not Jingwu.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **Administrative classification**: ""行政上依然是属于蜀山区"" — clearly references administrative boundaries.
  - **Economic distinction**: ""从经济上划分的独立区域"" — indicates economic or functional zoning.
  - **Comparison to Shenzhen**: used to illustrate the idea that economic status doesn't equate to administrative or symbolic independence.
  - **Local naming practice**: ""大部分合肥本地人提到天鹅湖都是说蜀山区天鹅湖"" — suggests how locals identify a place, which may reflect cultural or identity-based territorial cognition.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Administrative classification** is used to **reject the idea that Jingwu is a standalone ""local"" region**, and instead assert that it's still part of Shushan — this supports the author's view that local identity and boundaries are not defined by economic zoning.
  - **Economic distinction** is **explicitly contrasted** with administrative legitimacy — the author **rejects economic zoning as a valid basis** for defining local identity or local boundaries.
  - **Comparison to Shenzhen** reinforces the **functional role of administrative legitimacy** and **symbolic territorial identity** — the author is using it to say that economic zones do not redefine local identity.
  - **Local naming practice** shows how locals still associate Swan Lake with Shushan — this is **an implicit endorsement of socially conventional territorial identity**, where local people's naming habits reflect a deeper sense of belonging and regional cognition.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: Endorsed — the author supports the idea that local people still refer to Swan Lake as part of Shushan, indicating a conventional, socially accepted mental map of the city.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: Endorsed — the author clearly emphasizes that Jingwu is still administratively part of Shushan, rejecting the idea that economic zoning defines local identity.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: **Not endorsed** — although economic distinction is mentioned, the author **rejects** this as a valid standard for defining local identity.
  - **RL6 and others**: Not relevant — no mention of social roots, economic status, cultural-linguistic features, or occupational symbolism.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is asserting that **true local identity and regional boundaries** are not defined by economic zoning (RL5), but rather by **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) and **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), as evidenced by how locals still refer to Swan Lake as part of Shushan.

The text implies that while functional areas serve management purposes, they do not override or redefine the **administrative legitimacy** of where something ""belongs"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""归属于"" — clearly refers to administrative affiliation.
  *   Contrast between ""功能区"" and ""行政区"" — suggests that functional zones are not equivalent to administrative regions in terms of identity or legitimacy.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The use of **""归属于""** is central — the author is asserting that despite the existence of functional zoning, the **true administrative归属** of the area is under Shushan District.
  *   The author is **not merely describing**, but **arguing for a standard** (administrative legitimacy) by which the ""local identity"" or belonging of a place should be judged — not by its current functional use, but by its **administrative history and structure**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **administrative boundaries and归属 relationships** define the ""local"" identity of a place.

滨湖的都说滨湖宜居，吃喝玩乐都方便。不是杠，就是真的想问下具体是滨湖哪块都做到这样我认识的亲戚朋友在滨湖的，感觉地方大是大，但是人好少，也没什么好的商业圈一直都好好奇,** RL5," The author is expressing genuine curiosity and some skepticism about the commonly held view that ""Binhu (a district) is livable and convenient for daily life."" They are questioning the validity of this claim by pointing out that, based on their personal observations and social circle, Binhu seems large but sparsely populated, with underdeveloped commercial areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “滨湖宜居，吃喝玩乐都方便” (Binhu is livable and convenient for food, drinks, and entertainment) may relate to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.
  - The author's personal experience and social network in Binhu (“我认识的亲戚朋友在滨湖的”) may relate to **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - The author's skepticism about the livability of Binhu and lack of commercial vibrancy may suggest they are evaluating the **quality of the local area**, potentially related to **RL5** again.
  - The implicit comparison between the general perception and the author’s personal experience may relate to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, if the author is challenging the conventional view of what ""counts"" as a desirable or representative local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL5** is used to question the commonly accepted notion of ""livability"" in Binhu. The author implies that the area does not meet the standard of being livable due to a lack of commercial facilities and sparse population. This directly engages with RL5 logic.
  - **RL3** plays a role in grounding the author’s skepticism in personal experience. They know people who live in Binhu, which gives them a basis to question the general perception. However, the author is not using this to define who is a ""local"" but rather to validate their doubts about the area's quality.
  - **RL1** is potentially at play if we interpret the author as challenging the conventional symbolic perception of Binhu as a livable area, suggesting a different mental map or cognitive boundary for what should be considered a ""good"" local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **RL5** to evaluate the quality of Binhu as a local area. They question the claim that it is livable and convenient, based on the lack of commercial vibrancy and sparse population.
  - **RL1** is indirectly used to challenge the conventional perception of Binhu as a desirable or representative ""local"" area, though not explicitly stated as a new boundary definition.
  - **RL3** is mentioned but not used to define ""local identity"" or evaluate the area's local status—it serves more as background for the author’s skepticism.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's core argument is that the common belief in Binhu’s livability is questionable. They evaluate the area based on **functional livability**—commercial availability and population density—which aligns with **RL5**.
  - While **RL1** could be inferred through the challenge to the conventional perception, it is not the central or explicitly endorsed logic.
  - **RL3** is not directly used to define or evaluate local identity.

They contrast their own **lived, functional, and socially embedded local experience** (within the护城河 area, i.e., the moat-encircled old city core) with the **abstract or peripheral development** seen in newer districts like the high-tech zone or the政务区 (government administrative district). The author emphasizes that for them, **""local"" is defined not by economic growth or modern facilities alone, but by convenience, familiarity, and social rootedness.**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text includes the following relevant elements:
  - Reference to **specific areas** (包河区, 高新区, 政务区, 护城河内) and distinctions in development perception.
  - Emphasis on **functional livability**: proximity of schools, hospitals, convenience stores, and daily life amenities.
  - Emphasis on **social rootedness**: neighborhood familiarity, helping neighbors, long-standing community relationships.
  - Implicit contrast between **newer districts** and the **old city core**, suggesting a symbolic boundary for authentic local identity.
  - Mention of **daily life experiences** (e.g., walking to school, convenient healthcare, neighborhood help) as criteria for defining ""local quality"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly defines 护城河内 (within the city moat) as the authentic local core, contrasting it with newer districts. This reflects a **mental map** and **symbolic boundary** for ""true localness"".
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author emphasizes **proximity, convenience, and daily usability** of facilities (school, hospital, food, etc.) as key to a good local life. This is **explicitly linked to their standard for evaluating a good ""local"" area**.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author values **long-standing neighborhood familiarity**, **mutual help**, and **community relationships** as part of what makes a place truly ""local"". These are **socially rooted markers** that the author uses to **evaluate and define the quality of local life**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly endorses**:
    - **RL1:** The 护城河内 area as the symbolic, authentic local core.
    - **RL5:** Functional convenience and livability as key to a good local area.
    - **RL6:** Deep social roots and neighborhood familiarity as essential to a meaningful local experience.
  - The author **does not endorse** or use:
    - **RL2 (Administrative legitimacy)** — no reference to hukou, legal boundaries.
    - **RL3 (Family rootedness)** — no mention of birth, generational ties.
    - **RL4 (Cultural-linguistic)** — no mention of dialect, accent, or customs.
    - **RL7 (Occupational symbolism)** — no link between job type and local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that **true local identity or local quality** is not defined by flashy development or modern facilities alone, but by:
  - A **symbolically recognized core local area** (RL1),
  - **Daily functional convenience and livability** (RL5),
  - And **deep social integration and neighborhood familiarity** (RL6).

These three together form the author’s **implicit standard for evaluating what counts as a ""real"" or ""good"" local area**.

They are so satisfied that they plan to buy a second property in the same or nearby area. This indicates a positive association between the area's qualities and the author's concept of an ideal residential environment.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text mentions several attributes: **transportation convenience, metro access, presence of a mall, good residential environment, quality property management, good school district, and surrounding facilities**.
  *   These are all indicators of **functional livability and environmental quality**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   These attributes are not just background features; they are central to the author's **positive evaluation of the area** and their **decision to stay and invest in more property**.

这个不知道反正包河区公务员分数线最高，高的离谱,N/A," *   The author is expressing surprise or frustration about the high civil service exam cutoff scores in Baohe District, suggesting that these scores are unusually or unreasonably high.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text mentions **Baohe District**, a specific location.
  *   It references **civil service exam scores**, which are related to **occupational competition** and potentially **local value perception**, as high scores may indicate a desirable or competitive area to work or live in.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of high civil service scores is not used to define who is a local or to evaluate the cultural, historical, or administrative identity of the area.
  *   The author is **not asserting a definition of local identity** but rather commenting on the **competitiveness or desirability of a job or district**, which is **not sufficient** to qualify as a local identity defining criterion under the RL framework.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   No RL criteria are used by the author to define ""local identity"" or evaluate ""local"" areas.
  *   The text is a **comment on social competition or educational performance**, not a **definition or evaluation of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although Baohe District is mentioned (which might suggest RL1 or RL5), the author does **not** use it to define local identity or evaluate the area’s quality as a ""local"" space.
  *   There is **no endorsement or implication of any RL criteria** used to define or evaluate ""local"".

RL1, RL2, RL5, RL6"," The author is evaluating different districts in a city (likely Hefei) across various dimensions: industrial development (高新), environment (滨湖), atmosphere or ""liveliness"" (烟火气, associated with 庐阳), and administrative legitimacy (蜀山区). The author is not just describing each district but is implicitly constructing a framework for what makes a district ""local"" in different respects. The key is that the author is **using these criteria to define which areas are more ""local"" or central in different dimensions**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- **高新** (high-tech district): related to economic development, possibly RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
- **滨湖** (lakeside area): related to environmental quality, possibly RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)
- **庐阳** (old district with ""liveliness""): possibly RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) or RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
- **蜀山区** (Shushan District): explicitly mentioned as the most legitimate if judged by **administrative boundaries**, clearly RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author is **constructing a multi-dimensional view of ""local"" identity**, where different areas are ""more local"" depending on the standard used.
- Each RL element is **used to justify or define which area is more representative of ""local"" in a certain aspect**.
- The author **endorses** these criteria as valid or meaningful for evaluating the ""local"" status or centrality of each area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长合肥蜀山区人"" → Points to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - ""喜欢绿化好人少的居住环境...买房首选"" → Points to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as the author is linking environmental quality with the desirability and possibly the identity of a ""good local"" area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The phrase ""土生土长"" (born and raised here) is used to assert a deep, native connection to the local area, which serves as the foundation of the author's local identity. This is not just background information—it's used to justify their authority or alignment with what ""locals"" should value.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author explicitly links their residential preferences (greenery, low population density) with their property decisions. This implies that they view such environmental qualities as important standards for what makes a place a desirable or authentic ""local"" residential area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3** is clearly used to define the author’s own ""local"" identity and is endorsed.
  - **RL5** is used to evaluate and define the ""quality"" of a local area, and is directly tied to the author’s residential preferences and identity construction.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs their local identity based on being **born and raised locally (RL3)** and further defines what a ""good local area"" should be by emphasizing **environmental quality and livability (RL5)**.

The key idea is that being a ""本地人"" (local person) is tied to their birth and upbringing location — ""土生土长"" — and that this place holds a special emotional value for them.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长本地人"" — suggests a strong rootedness and generational connection to the place.
  - ""喜欢我庐阳"" — indicates emotional preference and attachment to a specific area based on personal history and identity.
  - ""目前居住滨湖"" — shows current residence, but it is contrasted with the author's emotional identification with their origin.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""土生土长"" functions to emphasize that the author's local identity stems from being born and raised in Luyang, not from where they currently live.
  - The preference for ""庐阳"" functions to show that emotional and identity-based ties to a region are central to the author's sense of being ""本地人"".
  - The mention of current residence in ""滨湖"" serves as a contrast to highlight that physical residence alone is not sufficient for defining ""local identity"" from the author's perspective.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author explicitly identifies as a ""土生土长本地人"" — this clearly endorses **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of housing prices could be linked to the **RL6** category, which involves economic status symbolism and its role in defining or evaluating local areas. However, the phrase does **not explicitly or implicitly state** that the author uses housing prices to define ""local identity"" or evaluate who counts as a local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author is only prompting a comparison of housing prices without clearly linking it to a definition of ""local identity"" or an evaluation standard of ""local"" areas, **no RL category is endorsed by the author for the purpose of defining ""local identity.""**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

大部分是工业区。地铁覆盖范围少，公园也就两个,RL5," *   The author is describing certain areas as having limited livability due to being predominantly industrial, having minimal metro coverage, and only a couple of parks. This implies a negative evaluation of the area's quality of life and possibly its status or desirability as a ""local"" residential area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Phrases such as ""地铁覆盖范围少"" (limited metro coverage) and ""公园也就两个"" (only two parks) point to functional aspects of the area’s infrastructure and livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   These elements are used to **evaluate the area negatively in terms of its functional livability**, suggesting that it lacks the basic amenities and transport infrastructure that would make it a desirable or high-quality ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly uses **functional livability factors** (transportation and public facilities) to judge the area’s quality and, by implication, its status or value as a ""local"" area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, where the author evaluates the area based on its metro coverage and number of parks — elements of functional livability — and implies these factors make it less desirable or of lower quality as a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The text mentions **transportation convenience** (""地铁公交都方便""), which is a livability factor.
  - It **compares two areas**, suggesting a **regional evaluation** based on this convenience.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The transportation convenience is used to **positively evaluate the South Station area** and **negatively contrast it with the Economic Development Zone**.
  - This implies that the author considers **functional livability (transportation)** as a **criterion for judging the quality or desirability of a local area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **functional livability** (specifically transportation infrastructure) to **evaluate and compare the ""local value"" of two areas**.
  - There is no indication that the author uses this to define who is ""local"", but rather to **assess the quality or desirability of a location** as a ""local"" residential area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author is using transportation convenience (a functional livability factor) to **evaluate the ""local"" quality of an area**.

  * The author clearly endorses the idea that public transportation (bus, metro) is convenient, which reflects a positive evaluation of the area’s **functional livability**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author is directly referencing transportation options (bus, metro) as convenient, and by implication, a standard for evaluating the livability or quality of a local area.

天天堵车，开车没地方停，没有快速路，红绿灯太多，住一下交通方便的地方就有对比,N/A," The author is expressing frustration with traffic conditions — including traffic jams, lack of parking, absence of expressways, and too many traffic lights — and implies that living in a place with better traffic conditions would highlight the contrast in quality of life. However, **there is no explicit or implicit statement** that these traffic or livability issues are **used to define ""local identity"" or to judge who counts as a ""local person""**. The text is purely about **quality of life or functional convenience**, not about **identity boundaries**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text mentions traffic inconvenience, parking difficulty, and lack of expressways — all of which fall under **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**. However, these are **not framed as identity-defining criteria**, only as **negative evaluations of the area’s functional quality**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The RL5-related content serves to **criticize the area’s livability**, but not to **define who is local** or to **establish identity boundaries**. There is **no suggestion that someone is more or less local based on these factors**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author does **not use these criteria to define local identity**, and the text is **not about identity boundaries or evaluation standards of ""local""**, these RL5 elements **do not qualify** for annotation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL category applies because the author is not constructing or endorsing any standard for defining ""local identity"".

我也住城区，但是近综合交通，你自己试试下高架5分钟就到家多舒服了,RL5," The author is emphasizing the comfort and convenience of their residential location, particularly its proximity to an overpass (高架), which allows them to get home in five minutes. This implies a positive evaluation of their living area based on **functional convenience**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “近综合交通” (close to comprehensive transportation) and “下高架5分钟就到家” (get off the overpass and arrive home in five minutes) strongly indicate **functional livability**, specifically transportation convenience.
  - There is no mention of cultural identity, family history, administrative boundaries, dialect, or social networks.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses transportation convenience as a **positive attribute** of their residential area.
  - This supports their broader **evaluation of the area as a good or ideal ""local"" place to live**, aligning with **RL5**, which concerns how functional and environmental qualities define or evaluate the quality of a ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **endorses** the idea that being close to transportation and having a short commute enhances the quality of a local area.
  - This is **not a neutral observation**; it is used to **justify the value or desirability of the local area**, thus fitting RL5.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s statement aligns with **RL5**, as it uses **transportation convenience** as a standard to evaluate the **quality of a local residential area** and, by implication, what constitutes a desirable or authentic ""local"" living environment.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL5"
我说的近综合交通不就这样吗？,N/A," The sentence ""我说的近综合交通不就这样吗？"" (Isn't what I'm saying about integrated transportation just like that?) is a rhetorical question implying that the author has previously expressed a view about integrated transportation, likely in the context of what constitutes a ""local"" area or what facilities define a place as ""local"" or desirable. However, this sentence alone does not contain a clear statement about the author's criteria for defining ""local identity"". It references transportation infrastructure but does not link it to any evaluative or definitional standard for ""local people"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The only potentially relevant keyword is “综合交通” (integrated transportation), which could relate to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as it involves infrastructure that contributes to livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  However, the phrase is vague and appears in a rhetorical question without any clear assertion or evaluation. There is no explicit or implicit statement that links integrated transportation to a standard for defining ""local people"" or evaluating the quality or boundaries of ""local"" areas. It is unclear whether the author endorses this as a criterion or is merely referencing it in passing.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the sentence does not contain a definable or endorsable criterion for ""local identity"", and the reference to transportation is too indirect and ambiguous, no RL category can be confidently applied.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL category applies due to insufficient or ambiguous content related to the definition or evaluation of ""local identity"".

我从地图上研究过，最方便的是华府骏苑那一块，距离各大商业区，银泰之心城万象城啥的，距离都比较平均。唯一缺点是周围好工作很少,None," The author is discussing a specific residential area (华府骏苑) in terms of its **functional convenience**, particularly its **proximity to commercial centers** (银泰, 心城, 万象城), while also noting a drawback: the **lack of high-quality jobs nearby**. However, the text **does not define or evaluate ""local people"" identity**—it is focused on **geographical convenience and job market quality**, not on criteria for who counts as ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of commercial centers and location-based convenience: may relate to **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**.
  - Mention of ""few good jobs"": might be linked to **RL5** or **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The functional convenience and job availability are **not used to define local identity**, but rather to **evaluate the quality of a residential area**.
  - There is **no implication that living in this area, proximity to commercial centers, or job availability defines someone as ""local""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Although RL5 and RL7 are mentioned, they are **not used to define ""local identity""**, but to **evaluate the livability or economic potential of a location**.
  - The author **does not endorse or imply** that these are **identity-defining criteria for being ""local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

有车之后你就知道，老城区堵车几小时的堵,** (No RL category applies)," The author is expressing frustration with traffic congestion in the old城区 (old city area), implying that having a car reveals the severe traffic problems that persist there for hours.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “老城区堵车几小时的堵” (the old城区 gets stuck in traffic for hours). This highlights a negative perception of the old城区's livability due to traffic congestion.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of chronic traffic congestion in the old城区 functions as a critique of its functional livability. The author implies that this makes the area less desirable or of lower quality, possibly influencing perceptions of where one would want to live or consider ""local"" in a positive sense.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is not defining who is ""local"" in terms of identity, but rather evaluating the **quality of the old城区** as a place to live. However, this evaluation is **not** explicitly or implicitly used to define who counts as a local person or to delineate local boundaries — it's more of a critique of infrastructure and convenience.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  Although the phrase touches on **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, it does not directly tie this to defining ""local identity"" or evaluating who is a local. The author is not saying that people who live in areas with bad traffic are not local, or that such areas should not be considered part of the local region — just that traffic is a major issue.

**Conclusion:** The text critiques the functional livability of the old城区 but does not use this as a standard to define ""local people"" or to evaluate the scope or legitimacy of ""local"" areas in a way that would qualify for RL annotation.

**Output:** (No RL category applies)"
还有双地铁4.6也是很方便，就是新房二手一起疯狂卷，还有五里庙和朗溪路高架不利因素美中不足,N/A," The author is describing a residential area that has good transportation (double subway lines 4 and 6), which is seen as convenient. However, they also point out negative aspects such as the oversupply and intense competition (""疯狂卷"") in both new and second-hand housing markets, and the presence of the Wulimiao area and Langxi Road elevated expressway as ""不利因素"" (disadvantages). The overall tone is evaluative, discussing the area’s residential quality, but **not clearly defining or discussing the concept of ""local identity""** in terms of who counts as a local person.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""双地铁4.6""** (double subway lines 4 and 6): This relates to functional convenience and livability.
  - **""新房二手一起疯狂卷""** (new and second-hand housing markets are both overheated/competitive): This speaks to housing market dynamics and possibly economic symbolism.
  - **""五里庙和朗溪路高架""** (Wulimiao and Langxi Road elevated expressway): These are environmental or infrastructural drawbacks.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements are used to evaluate the **quality of the residential area** — whether it is desirable or not to live there — but **not to define who is a ""local"" person** or to demarcate the boundaries of ""local"" identity.
  - There is **no explicit or implicit endorsement of criteria** for defining ""local people"" based on geography, family history, culture, or administrative status.
  - The focus is on **livability and environmental quality**, which are **RL5 elements**, but **not used to define local identity**, only to evaluate the area’s desirability.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - None of the elements are used to define ""local identity"" or to distinguish who is a ""local"".
  - The author is not constructing or evaluating **identity** or **boundaries of localness**, but rather discussing **housing market dynamics** and **infrastructure pros and cons**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - Although the text contains elements that **could** fall under RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), **they are not used by the author to define ""local identity""** or to evaluate the ""localness"" of people or areas in terms of identity.
  - Therefore, **no RL categories are applicable**.

肥东必须是最差，工业园不说了，空气环境不行，交通也不行，设施也跟不上 ， 下雨就涝，地震中心,RL5," The author is expressing a negative evaluation of Feidong (肥东), focusing on multiple aspects such as industrialization, environmental quality, transportation, infrastructure, and natural disaster risks. The core expressive intent is to argue that Feidong does **not** meet the standard of a desirable or high-quality local area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""工业园不说了"" (industrial park, not even worth mentioning) → hints at functional livability.
  - ""空气环境不行"" (air/environment is bad) → environmental quality.
  - ""交通也不行"" (transportation is bad) → functional livability.
  - ""设施也跟不上"" (facilities are inadequate) → functional livability.
  - ""下雨就涝"" (floods when it rains) → environmental quality/livability.
  - ""地震中心"" (earthquake epicenter) → environmental risk.

All these elements point to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses these elements to construct a **negative evaluation of Feidong as a place to live**, implying that it fails to meet the standard of a ""good"" or ""ideal"" local area. These are not just complaints about infrastructure or environment; they are **used as criteria to judge the area's quality and, by implication, its status or value as a ""local"" area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  All the mentioned criteria are used by the author to **evaluate Feidong negatively** as a ""local"" area. They are not resisted or described as others’ views — they are part of the author’s own evaluative framework.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is clearly applying **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, using environmental and infrastructural shortcomings as a standard to judge Feidong as a poor-quality local area.

交通确实很方便的,N/A," The phrase ""交通确实很方便的"" (Transportation is indeed very convenient) primarily expresses a positive evaluation of the functional livability of a location—specifically its transportation convenience. However, the task requires identifying whether this evaluation is **used by the author as a criterion to define ""local identity"" or evaluate ""local"" areas**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase refers to **transportation**, which is a strong candidate for **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as it directly relates to the functional quality of an area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  However, the phrase does **not** explicitly or implicitly link transportation convenience to the definition of ""local people"" or the boundaries or value of ""local"" areas. It's a **standalone evaluation of convenience**, not a standard used to **categorize or define local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since there is **no indication** that the author uses transportation convenience as a **criterion for defining local identity or evaluating local areas**, this does **not qualify** for RL5 or any other RL category.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL category applies because the statement is **not used by the author to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or ""local areas""**—it is simply a comment on transportation quality.

However, there is **no explicit or implicit endorsement of criteria for defining ""local identity""** or evaluating who counts as a ""local"". The mention of high housing prices and lack of improvement options are **economic and functional observations**, not criteria for defining ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""方便"" (convenient)** → potentially RL5
  *   **""房价贵"" (expensive housing prices), ""改善也没有选择"" (no better options)** → potentially RL6 if linked to economic status or local identity legitimacy

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **convenience** is mentioned as a **positive quality of the area**, but it is not used to define who is a local or to evaluate local identity.

我也喜欢七里塘，摆摊吃 真的很方便，去步行街也很方便，离省医院也不远，也不用下班开车去挤那边,RL5," The author expresses personal convenience and satisfaction with the location of Qilitang (七里塘), mentioning ease of access to street food, the pedestrian street, and the provincial hospital, as well as avoiding traffic congestion after work.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text mentions:
  - Convenience of amenities and accessibility (street food, pedestrian street, hospital)
  - Avoidance of traffic congestion
  These relate to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as the author appreciates the area based on its functional convenience and livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author evaluates Qilitang positively based on its accessibility and convenience, which contributes to their personal perception of it as a desirable or ""good"" local area to be in or near. This implies that **functional livability factors** are part of how they judge or define the quality of a local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly endorses the **livability and functional convenience** of the area as a positive quality, which contributes to their favorable view of Qilitang as a local area. This aligns with RL5.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author uses **RL5** logic — they define a desirable ""local"" area based on its **functional livability**, such as proximity to amenities, ease of access, and avoidance of congestion. There is no mention of other RL criteria (e.g., cultural identity, administrative boundaries, etc.).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""配套设施"" (supporting facilities) – points to the presence of infrastructure and services.
  - ""离老城区也很近"" (very close to the old city area) – suggests proximity to a historically and socially significant part of the city.
  - ""方便"" (convenient) – indicates functional accessibility and practicality of the location.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of facilities and proximity to the old city supports the idea that the area is functionally livable and accessible, which contributes to its desirability or ""local value"".
  - The reference to the old city implies a conventional or socially accepted understanding of where the core local area is, and being close to it enhances the local identity or desirability of the area in question.
  - These elements are positively evaluated and are used by the author to support an implicit argument that this area is a good or authentic ""local"" place.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly accepts the conventional understanding that being close to the ""老城区"" (old city area) enhances the local identity or desirability of a location. This suggests a socially accepted mental map where the old city is the core, and proximity to it defines local identity or quality.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author evaluates the area positively based on its facilities and convenience, directly linking these to its quality as a ""local"" area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

The author also explicitly denies any ""regional discrimination"", indicating that their definition is based on perceived urban development and infrastructure.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The author describes the current urban scope using **major infrastructure (highways and elevated roads)** as boundary markers, which suggests a **socially conventional mental map** of where the ""urban core"" is perceived to be.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The use of infrastructure to define the current ""urban area"" functions as a **symbolic boundary** for identifying what areas are considered part of the ""real"" or ""core"" city, based on current development and public perception. The author is **not** using administrative boundaries, household registration, cultural identity, or economic status — they are drawing a **mentally mapped urban scope** based on development trends.

我小时候从济钢到市区叫做“去济南”。……而且还要坐火车去“济南”，那时济钢桥头有个374车站，编号是距离青岛站374公里的意思，后面改叫韩仓站，现在废弃了。后来有了8路、10路公交车……现在公交、地铁一应俱全，不过不超过CBD（原二钢）还是电瓶车最方便,"RL1, RL5"," The author is reminiscing about transportation changes over time in the Jinan steel plant area (济钢), describing how the region has evolved from being considered outside the city core (""去济南"" implies going to the city) to being integrated into the urban system with new infrastructure like buses and subways. Despite this, the author notes that even now, electric carts remain the most convenient transportation in certain areas near the former steel plant (CBD, 原二钢). This implies a persistent perception of the area as somewhat peripheral or distinct within the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The distinction between ""济钢"" and ""市区""/""济南"" implies a **mental map or regional boundary** (RL1).
  - The renaming and integration of the train station (374 station → Han Cang station), and the development of public transport (8路, 10路, subway) reflect **changes in social recognition or current consensus** about the area's status (RL1).
  - Mention of the **CBD (Central Business District)** and its connection to the former steel plant (""原二钢"") implies a **functional livability and environmental quality cognition**, particularly in how the area is evaluated in terms of convenience and urban development (RL5).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 elements** (e.g., ""去济南"", renaming of stations, perception of the area as needing special transport modes like electric carts) serve to highlight the **historical and psychological boundary** between the steel plant area and the city proper. The author implies that even with administrative or infrastructural integration, a **symbolic distinction remains** in daily life and perception.
  - The **RL5 elements** (e.g., ""公交、地铁一应俱全"", ""电瓶车最方便"") are used to **evaluate the area's livability and urban integration**, but also to imply that it's still not fully on par with the city center — hence the continued reliance on electric carts.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that the **mental boundary** between ""济钢"" and ""济南"" still exists, despite administrative or infrastructural changes — this supports **RL1**.
  - The author also implicitly evaluates the area’s **livability and convenience**, which supports **RL5**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly present: the author uses historical and psychological boundary markers to show that the steel plant area was once seen as outside the city proper and still carries that symbolic status in some ways.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** is also present: the author evaluates the area’s transportation convenience and infrastructure development, suggesting that while it has improved, it still has limitations (e.g., electric carts remain the most convenient in some parts), which reflects a **quality-based evaluation of the area’s local value**.

我小时候以前从章丘到济南还有收费站,RL2," The author is recalling a past situation where there was still a toll station between Zhangqiu and Jinan, implying a sense of change over time in the regional connection between the two places. This observation hints at a transformation in the perceived relationship or integration between Zhangqiu and Jinan, possibly related to identity or boundary perceptions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “从章丘到济南还有收费站” (there was still a toll station from Zhangqiu to Jinan). Toll stations are often associated with administrative boundaries and can symbolize a physical and symbolic separation between regions. This implies a past administrative or territorial distinction that has since changed.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of the toll station is not about its functional purpose (e.g., revenue collection), but rather what it represents: a former boundary marker between Zhangqiu and Jinan. The author uses this to reflect on how that boundary — and perhaps the sense of identity or belonging — has changed. This supports a reflection on shifting perceptions of local identity tied to administrative or symbolic boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does not explicitly oppose the idea of administrative boundaries influencing identity. Instead, they reflect on how the removal of the toll station (and thus the softening of the boundary) affects the perception of connection between the two places. This implies that administrative legitimacy (RL2) — in this case, the symbolic presence of a toll station as a boundary marker — plays a role in how local identity is perceived or experienced.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author uses the toll station as a symbol of past administrative division, which had implications for how Zhangqiu and Jinan were perceived in relation to each other. This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the toll station functioned as a marker of administrative boundaries, and its removal implies a change in how these areas are administratively and symbolically linked.

坐标槐荫……86年……小时候我们在机务段做火车去市里……,RL3," The text is a brief reminiscence by the author, mentioning their location (Huaiyin), a year (1986), and a childhood memory of taking a train from the locomotive depot to the city. The author appears to be invoking a sense of nostalgia and personal history tied to the local area. The key aspect here is the **personal, lived experience of growing up in the area**, especially in contrast to others who may not have such early, deep connections.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""坐标槐荫""** (Coordinates: Huaiyin) — suggests a specific local identity or self-identification with a place.
  - **""86年""** (1986) — implies a generational or historical time reference.
  - **""小时候我们在机务段做火车去市里""** (When we were little, we took trains from the locomotive depot to the city) — evokes early life experiences and a sense of growing up locally, possibly implying a deeper connection to the area than newer residents.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not explicitly arguing or evaluating the quality of the area in terms of facilities, culture, or economy.
  - The emphasis is on **growing up in the area**, **childhood memories**, and **long-standing familiarity with local infrastructure** (e.g., the locomotive depot and train travel to the city center).
  - These elements **imply a sense of being “rooted”** in the area from an early age, suggesting that **local identity is tied to long-term, formative presence** rather than current residence or economic status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not** mention administrative boundaries, dialect, economic status, or cultural habits.
  - The author **does** imply that having **a long-standing, childhood connection to the area** (and by extension, family history and early settlement) is a **marker of authentic local identity**.
  - Therefore, the **core RL criterion endorsed by the author is RL3**, which is about **family historical rootedness or individual growth history**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s narrative centers on **growing up locally**, **childhood experiences**, and **early exposure to the city**, all of which are strong indicators of **RL3**.
  - The tone suggests that **those who grew up in the area (like the author) have a deeper or more authentic claim to being “local”** than those who came later.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL3"
我知道济南历史文化名城，论经济青岛不算是后起之秀吗，济南现在历下市中发展比较好，资源倾斜都感受不到吗，我遇到的都按发展谈论市区，可能和年轻人讨论比较多，基本都看发展，大家公认青岛发展会比济南好，但现在新建地铁，可能也是新机遇,** RL5," The author is comparing the development status and perception of two cities — Jinan and Qingdao. They suggest that Qingdao is generally perceived as having better development, though Jinan is seeing new opportunities (e.g., new metro construction). The discussion centers around **regional perception and evaluation**, especially among young people, based on **development indicators**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""发展比较好"" (relatively better development)
  - ""资源倾斜都感受不到吗"" (lack of perceived resource allocation)
  - ""按发展谈论市区"" (discussing urban areas based on development)
  - ""大家都公认青岛发展会比济南好"" (general consensus that Qingdao is better developed)
  - ""新建地铁，可能也是新机遇"" (new metro brings new opportunities)

  These phrases suggest **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**, as the author links development, resource allocation, and infrastructure (e.g., metro construction) to the perception and evaluation of a city's quality and status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is not defining local identity through family roots, dialect, or administrative boundaries. Instead, they are **evaluating the cities** — particularly in terms of **development and infrastructure** — and discussing how these factors influence **perception and status**. This plays into **RL5**, as the author implies that development and infrastructure (like metro systems) are key criteria for evaluating the **quality of a local area** and thus shaping its identity in people's minds.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does not oppose development or infrastructure as evaluative criteria; rather, they **endorse and reflect on these as key standards** used by people (especially young people) to judge which city is ""better"" or ""more local"" in a social perception sense.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The text fits **RL5**, as it centers on evaluating and comparing urban areas based on their **functional livability**, especially **infrastructure and development status**, which are used as **standards for judging the quality or status of a ""local"" area**.

94年的，小时候住大明湖附近，感觉济南最西是现在和谐那边，最东是甸柳庄，最北是洛口，最南是东八里洼。那时候跟爸爸回章丘爷爷家，过了甸柳庄都是土路....以至于我家搬到奥体附近住十多年了，去泉城路玩都还叫去市里哈哈,RL1**," The author is reminiscing about how their perception of the ""local"" boundaries of Jinan was shaped during childhood. They describe the perceived edges of the city (west, east, north, south) based on their early experiences and contrast that with how those boundaries have shifted over time, especially after moving to a new area (奥体附近). The author still refers to the central area (泉城路) as ""市里"", which reflects a **lingering mental map** of where the ""real"" or ""core"" local area is.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Childhood residence near Daming Lake (RL3 – growth history)
  - Perception of city boundaries based on childhood understanding (RL1 – socially conventional territorial identity)
  - Reference to ""市里"" (the city center), implying a symbolic distinction (RL1)
  - Change in residence to Aoti area and continued reference to old core as ""市里"" (RL1 – reflects a mental map and emotional attachment)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - Childhood residence and experience (RL3) are used to ground the author’s **early understanding** of what constituted ""Jinan"" or ""local"", but not as a claim of being more ""local"" than others.
  - The author's mental map of the city (RL1) is central to the narrative — it shows how their **subjective, socially conventional** sense of ""local"" was formed and how it lingers even after physical relocation.
  - The use of ""市里"" to refer to the old central area reflects a **symbolic and habitual** understanding of where the ""real"" local center is, reinforcing RL1.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses a **subjective, socially conventional understanding** of local boundaries and identity based on early experiences and emotional attachment — this maps to **RL1**.
  - RL3 (growth history) is mentioned but not used as a **criterion for defining local identity** in a judgmental or evaluative way; it supports RL1 but is not independently qualifying.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s narrative centers on how their **mental map** and **habitual understanding** of what constitutes the ""local"" space in Jinan were formed through early experiences and have persisted over time. This aligns directly with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  - There is no endorsement of administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic traits, or economic status as defining features of local identity in this passage.

**Step 6: Output Result**

**Output: RL1**"
我06的，家在市中区，现在往泉城路还习惯说是去市里,RL1**," The author is expressing a habitual way of referring to a location (""市里"") when talking about going to ""泉城路"", which reflects an **implicit认同** of a spatial or identity-based distinction between their home area (市中区) and what is considered the core urban area or ""local center"" (市里). This implies a conventional understanding of where the ""local core"" is, rooted in long-standing social or personal habit.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""家在市中区"" → potentially relates to **RL1** (territorial identity) and **RL3** (rootedness).
  - ""往泉城路还习惯说是去市里"" → clearly reflects a **mental map or conventional spatial understanding**, implying泉城路 is part of the core ""市里"" and市中区 is not, or at least not perceived as such in the speaker's habitual logic. This aligns with **RL1**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author's habitual phrasing (""还习惯说是去市里"") indicates a **socially conventional cognitive boundary** between ""市里"" and other areas such as ""市中区"". This is not about administrative boundaries or legal identity, but rather a **symbolic or perceptual boundary** that reflects **RL1** logic.
  - The phrase does **not** imply administrative criteria (RL2), nor does it emphasize family history (RL3), language (RL4), facilities (RL5), social roots (RL6), or occupation (RL7).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL1** is clearly endorsed here. The author implicitly accepts a **conventional, symbolic spatial understanding** that defines ""市里"" as a distinct and meaningful local core area.
  - There is no indication that the author endorses administrative boundaries, family history, or any other criteria as the basis for defining ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's habitual expression reflects a **socially conventional understanding of local spatial identity**, which is the hallmark of **RL1**.
  - This usage implies a **symbolic boundary** between different areas and a **conventional perception** of where the ""real local"" or ""core local"" area is.

**Step 6: Output Result**

**Output: RL1**"
看标题，2022年，我说的跟老市区没有一点关系,RL1," The author is emphasizing that their discussion has **nothing to do with the old urban core area (""老市区"")**, and is likely resisting or rejecting a commonly held view that associates something (possibly identity, development, or change) with the traditional city center. The author is drawing a **symbolic boundary** between ""老市区"" and what they are discussing.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “跟老市区没有一点关系” (has nothing to do with the old city center), which implies a **mental or symbolic boundary** between the speaker and the traditional urban core. This reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** logic.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  By explicitly distancing their topic from ""老市区"", the author is **defining a non-traditional or peripheral identity or scope**, using the symbolic meaning of ""老市区"" as the **benchmark for contrast**. This implies that ""老市区"" carries a **conventional or habitual understanding of what counts as ""local""**, and the author is positioning themselves outside of that identity framework.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is not defining themselves as local in the conventional, habitual, or symbolic sense tied to the old city center. Therefore, they are **rejecting the RL1-based conventional identity**, but the very act of rejection implies that **RL1 is a recognized standard they are contrasting against**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is **not endorsing** RL1 directly, but they are **implicitly referencing** it as a **socially conventional understanding of ""local"" identity** to define the scope of their own argument. Therefore, **RL1 is relevant** because the author is positioning their discussion in contrast to the conventional understanding of ""local"" rooted in the old city center.

所以并不是所有的老济南人都认准那一块，你要搞清楚，就天桥槐荫那块小时候呆了20年，等有钱买房了第一时间搬到领秀城附近，这才是老济南的缩影,"RL3, RL6"," The author is expressing a common behavioral pattern among ""老济南人"" (longtime native Jinan residents), suggesting that despite having grown up in a traditional ""old"" part of the city (天桥槐荫), when given the opportunity, they move to a newer, presumably more upscale residential area (领秀城), which the author sees as emblematic of what ""老济南"" really aspire to.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""老济南人"" — implies a cultural or historical local identity.
- ""天桥槐荫那块小时候呆了20年"" — indicates a long personal history in a traditional local area.
- ""搬到领秀城附近"" — implies a shift in residential status and possibly in perception of what is considered ""desirable"" or ""ideal"" local space.
- The contrast between old and new areas suggests a value judgment about residential quality and local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
- ""小时候呆了20年"" supports **RL3** — rootedness and growth history.
- The contrast between staying in an old neighborhood and moving to a new one implies that **residential choice and mobility** are part of what defines a ""true local"" — this links to **RL6**, where economic capability and choice of residence indicate deeper or more legitimate local identity.
- The implication that only certain areas are seen as desirable or representative of ""good local living"" may also hint at **RL5**, as the author suggests that these newer areas have better livability features.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument**
- The author implies that **true locals are those who have deep roots (RL3)** but also **have the economic means to move to better areas (RL6)**.
- The text **does not emphasize administrative boundaries (RL2)**, language/culture (RL4), or resist any criteria — so these are excluded.
- The author **does not directly describe cultural-linguistic traits (RL4)** or explicitly define a mental map of the city (RL1), though there is a contrast between areas, which may be implied.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author mentions growing up in 天桥槐荫 for 20 years, indicating a deep personal connection to the city, which forms the basis of local identity.
- **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The act of moving to 领秀城 when financially able is framed as a ""true local"" behavior, suggesting that economic mobility and asset ownership are part of what defines a ""legitimate"" or ""evolved"" local identity.

洪楼很方便，可以坐地铁，推荐华山湖公园，环联夜市，洪楼教堂，省美术馆博物馆啥的都可以去看看,RL5," The author is describing the convenience and attractiveness of the Honglou (洪楼) area, highlighting its accessibility via地铁 (subway) and recommending various nearby attractions and facilities such as parks, night markets, churches, and museums. The core intent appears to be promoting the area as a livable and culturally rich location.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""洪楼很方便，可以坐地铁"" — RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition): Mentions subway access as a livability feature.
  * ""推荐华山湖公园，环联夜市，洪楼教堂，省美术馆博物馆啥的都可以去看看"" — RL5: Mentions cultural and recreational facilities as positive attributes of the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of subway access and nearby cultural/recreational facilities serves to **highlight the area's livability and appeal**, supporting the author's positive evaluation of Honglou as a desirable or representative local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The RL5 elements are directly used to **evaluate the quality of the area** and imply that such features make it a good or authentic ""local"" area, consistent with the author's positive portrayal.

They suggest that ""Old Jinan"" used to refer only to the area within the moat, but the city has grown significantly. Despite this, they maintain that the authentic or core ""Old Jinan"" identity still belongs to the original small central area. They also acknowledge the administrative expansions, including the incorporation of areas like Laiwu and Zhangqiu, but differentiate that growth doesn't equate with making those areas inherently part of the traditional ""老济南"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""老济南只有护城河里面那一块"" — suggests a traditional or socially conventional boundary of local identity.
  *   ""老济南画个小圈圈就好啦"" — reinforces the idea of a limited, traditional spatial understanding of ""local"".
  *   ""现在莱芜章丘也并入济南了吧"" — references administrative boundary changes.
  *   ""毕竟是省会，不发展一下如何是好"" — acknowledges the need for development and expansion but does **not** directly define local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The idea of ""老济南"" being limited to the area within the moat functions as a **socially conventional understanding** of local identity, contrasting with newer administrative boundaries.
  *   The mention of Laiwu and Zhangqiu being incorporated into Jinan functions as a **reference to administrative legitimacy**, but the author implicitly **resists** considering these as part of the authentic ""老济南"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **endorses** the idea that ""老济南"" is defined by a **traditional, socially accepted spatial boundary** — the area within the moat.
  *   The author **acknowledges** administrative expansion but **does not endorse** it as a defining criterion of ""老济南"" identity.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of cultural, linguistic, historical rootedness, economic, or functional criteria in defining ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's view aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they define ""老济南"" based on a traditional, socially accepted spatial cognition — the area within the moat.
  *   The author does **not** endorse administrative changes (RL2) as sufficient to redefine ""老济南"", though they acknowledge them.

我爷爷说护城河以里是济南，我姑姑嫁去全福都觉得是『闺女嫁外头去了』…80后（我）觉得市区还是二环里，下班回家觉得过来二环东才算进市区…当然了，东部发展的比其他地方都快，是二环南二环北二环西都比不上的，但内心还是觉得，那是『二环外』,RL1**," The author is expressing a personal and generational perspective on what constitutes the ""real"" or ""core"" local area of Jinan (济南), contrasting it with peripheral areas. They describe how different generations (grandfather, aunt, and themselves) define the ""local"" area based on **mental maps** and **emotional attachment**, not administrative boundaries or facilities. The author feels that despite the eastern part developing rapidly, it still feels like ""outside the second ring road"" — not the authentic local core.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Generational differences in defining local identity → possibly **RL3** (family rootedness)
  - Reference to emotional/geographical boundaries (护城河以里, 二环里, 二环外) → **RL1**
  - Mention of development disparity (东部发展快) → potentially **RL5**, but not used to define ""local""
  - Implicit contrast between official development status and emotional belonging → **RL1** emphasized

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The generational differences (RL3) are mentioned but not used to define ""who is local"", rather to show how **perceptions of local space change over time** — not the author's core argument.
  - The **emotional boundary perception** (RL1) is the **core logic** the author uses to define what is truly ""local"" — the inner second ring road and moat area — indicating a **socially conventional, emotionally rooted territorial identity**.
  - The **development status (RL5)** is mentioned but **not used to validate** or define local identity; in fact, it's contrasted with the author’s inner sense of where ""local"" really is.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL1** is used by the author to define the **core local area** and to express **emotional and symbolic boundary distinctions**.
  - RL3 and RL5 are mentioned but **not used as criteria** to define local identity — they serve **contextual or contrasting roles**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **""local"" is defined by a socially conventional, emotionally rooted mental map** — the area within the moat and second ring road is the **true local heartland**, while the eastern expansion, despite its development, remains ""outside"".
  - This aligns directly with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

批发市场不是市区吗？？你家的批发市场在农村啊？？,RL1**," The author is challenging the idea that a wholesale market can be considered part of the ""city"" or ""urban area"", implying that such markets are typically found in rural or non-core urban areas. The rhetorical tone suggests the author believes there is a **symbolic or spatial boundary** between what counts as ""urban"" (市区) and what does not — and that the presence of a wholesale market (批发市场) is a marker of non-urban or peripheral identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “批发市场不是市区吗？？” implies a **rejection** of the idea that a wholesale market can be part of the city center.
  - The rhetorical question “你家的批发市场在农村啊？？” implies a **symbolic association** between wholesale markets and rural areas.
  - This suggests a **mental map or symbolic boundary** that the author uses to distinguish between urban and rural, or core local vs. non-core local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The mention of ""批发市场"" (wholesale market) is used to **contrast** urban and rural areas.
  - The author is **reinforcing a spatial hierarchy** in which certain types of facilities or land uses are **symbolic markers** of rural or non-local (non-urban) identity.
  - This supports a **symbolic boundary** between what counts as the city (市区) and what is considered rural — a boundary that the author sees as self-evident or commonly understood.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument**
  - The author is **endorsing a symbolic spatial boundary** that distinguishes urban from rural.
  - This boundary is based on **shared social understanding or conventional spatial cognition**, not legal or administrative definitions.
  - The logic is used to **evaluate the scope or symbolic meaning of ""local"" urban space**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - This matches **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the author is relying on **commonly accepted or assumed spatial cognition** to define what counts as ""市区"" (urban area), using the presence or absence of certain facilities (批发市场) as a **symbolic marker** of urban vs. rural identity.

章丘人，上了大学说自己是济南的，别的区的觉得我碰瓷。。。。。说的和我们很想并入你们一样章丘市不比区大气啊？,"**  
RL1"," * The author is expressing frustration or irony about how other districts in Jinan look down upon Zhangqiu people claiming to be ""Jinan locals."" The author implies that Zhangqiu, though now a district, was historically a city and thus should not be seen as inferior or less ""local"" than other districts of Jinan.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""章丘人"" (Zhangqiu person) – implies a local identity tied to a specific place.
  * ""上了大学说自己是济南的"" (said I’m from Jinan after going to university) – indicates a claim to broader local identity.
  * ""别的区的觉得我碰瓷"" (people from other districts think I’m碰瓷 [claiming something falsely for ulterior motives]) – implies a contested or resisted boundary of local identity.
  * ""章丘市不比区大气啊？"" (Isn’t Zhangqiu City more impressive than a district?) – reflects a belief in Zhangqiu’s symbolic or historical status as a city, suggesting it should carry equal or greater weight in local identity than other districts.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author is challenging the perception that only certain districts are ""truly"" Jinan, while Zhangqiu, despite being historically a city, is treated as an outsider. This implies a belief that the definition of ""local"" in Jinan should consider **historical and symbolic status**, not just current administrative boundaries or social perceptions.
  * The question “Isn’t Zhangqiu City more impressive than a district?” directly challenges the **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) standard that others are using to exclude Zhangqiu from being “real” Jinan.
  * The author’s identification as a “Zhangqiu person” and the frustration over being seen as falsely claiming Jinan identity implies a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1), where the author believes Zhangqiu should be included within the broader “Jinan local” identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly resists the idea that administrative status alone (RL2) should determine local identity, but the very fact that they bring it up shows that they recognize it as a standard used by others — and they are arguing **against** that standard.
  * The author **endorses** the idea that Zhangqiu, due to its historical and symbolic status as a former city, should be seen as part of the local identity — this supports **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is advocating for a broader, more inclusive definition of ""Jinan local"" that includes Zhangqiu based on **historical and symbolic recognition**, not just current administrative boundaries.
  * This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author is pushing back against the conventional mental map or socially accepted boundary of what is considered ""Jinan local.""

呃，有没有想过被划进来的也不喜欢济南啊，纯纯被济南吸血光靠济南市区早就让烟台超了,"** `RL1, RL2, RL6`"," The author is expressing dissatisfaction with the idea that areas incorporated into Jinan (济南) administratively do not necessarily identify with or benefit from Jinan, and in fact, feel economically exploited (""被济南吸血""). The author also implies that other cities like Yantai (烟台) have surpassed Jinan in terms of economic strength, suggesting a comparison in urban development and possibly implying that Jinan is not a desirable ""local"" reference point.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""被划进来的"" —— suggests administrative incorporation (RL2).
  - ""不喜欢济南"" —— implies a sense of local identity not aligned with Jinan, possibly related to socially conventional territorial identity (RL1).
  - ""被济南吸血"" —— implies economic exploitation, possibly related to RL6 (economic status symbolism).
  - ""烟台超了"" —— implies economic comparison and possibly a value judgment on Jinan as a local area, possibly linking to RL5 or RL6.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""被划进来的"" (RL2): This phrase is central to the author's argument — that administrative boundaries do not equate to local identification. The author uses this to challenge the legitimacy of defining someone as part of Jinan merely based on administrative inclusion.
  - ""不喜欢济南"" (RL1): This reflects a psychological or emotional boundary — a rejection of Jinan as a local identity. The author implies that true local identity cannot be imposed administratively.
  - ""被济南吸血"" (RL6): This indicates economic exploitation, and the author uses this to delegitimize Jinan's claim as a desirable or representative ""local"" center.
  - ""烟台超了"" (RL6): This is used to support the claim that Jinan is not economically dominant or attractive, reinforcing the idea that being ""local"" to Jinan is not a desirable status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): The author critiques the use of administrative boundaries as a basis for local identity, but the phrase itself is used to question its validity — not endorse it. However, the mention is functional in the argument and implies that **administrative legitimacy is a commonly used but flawed standard**, so it is relevant.
  - RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity): The author supports the idea that emotional or psychological identification (not just administrative inclusion) defines local identity. This is clearly endorsed.
  - RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism): The author uses economic exploitation and the economic comparison with Yantai to critique Jinan's status as a ""local"" center. This is clearly part of the author’s argument and is endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author argues that being administratively part of Jinan does not equate to feeling local to Jinan, emphasizing emotional and psychological boundaries over administrative ones (RL1). They critique the administrative logic of defining ""local"" (RL2), and support the idea that economic dynamics (exploitation and relative development) affect how people perceive themselves as ""local"" or not (RL6).

**Output:** `RL1, RL2, RL6`"
老槐荫的传统思想，十二马路以西，纬一路以东，经一路以北，十一马路以南都比较偏你说二环外？那就是农村啊,"**  
RL1"," The author is expressing a traditional, locally rooted perception of the city's spatial identity, asserting that certain areas within specific street boundaries (十二马路以西，纬一路以东，经一路以北，十一马路以南) are already ""peripheral"" or ""偏"". They further reject the idea that areas beyond the second ring road (""二环外"") can be considered part of the city, referring to them as ""农村"" (countryside/rural), which in this context implies not truly ""local"" urban space.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Use of **traditional street boundary references** (十二马路、纬一路、经一路、十一马路) to define local spatial cognition.
  - Use of **mental map** to distinguish ""urban"" vs. ""rural"" and by implication, ""local"" vs. ""non-local"".
  - Implicit **hierarchical division** of space based on distance from the perceived urban core.
  - Use of evaluative language like “偏” and “农村” to **disparage outer areas** as not part of the real city or local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The street boundaries and spatial logic serve as **symbolically significant markers** of traditional local identity.
  - The author is **resisting the expansion of the ""local"" identity** to include areas beyond the second ring road.
  - The language implies a **strong emotional and cognitive boundary** between what is considered ""local urban"" and what is not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **traditional spatial cognition and mental mapping** to define what counts as ""local"" or not.
  - There is **no endorsement of administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic markers, or economic criteria**, even though these may exist implicitly.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The text clearly fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it relies on **established spatial cognition and symbolic boundary-making** rooted in social habit and local perception to define what areas are considered ""local"" and which are not.
  - The author is reinforcing a **traditional mental map** that defines the ""core local"" area and demarcates the ""non-local"" periphery.

**Output:**

差不多吧，这个和济南公共交通建设网络有关系吧，地铁基本上就围着城郊走一圈，市区去东南西北如果乘坐公共汽车或者打车也蛮麻烦的,N/A," The author is commenting on the layout of Jinan's public transportation network, particularly the地铁 (subway) system, suggesting that it primarily encircles the suburban areas rather than effectively serving the city center. They imply that this makes traveling from the city center to the outskirts inconvenient when using buses or taxis.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author references public transportation patterns and spatial travel convenience.
  - They are discussing the spatial structure and accessibility of the city, which may reflect perceptions of urban centrality and peripherality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The discussion of transportation layout is not about who counts as a ""local"" person, nor is it about administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or occupational symbolism.
  - The text evaluates the quality of public infrastructure and its impact on convenience, but **does not directly link** this to criteria for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating the scope or value of ""local"" areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - None of the RL categories are explicitly or implicitly used by the author to define ""local people"" or evaluate the legitimacy or value of ""local"" areas.
  - The discussion is about transportation convenience, not about identity, belonging, or regional legitimacy.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - No RL category applies, as the author is not defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local areas"" based on the RL criteria.

**Step 6: Output Result**

She defines the boundaries of her local world based on where she lived and moved during childhood—limited by specific landmarks (Hero Mountain, long-distance bus station, 101 tram terminus, Shierma Road). She humorously resists her husband’s criticism of her limited knowledge of Jinan roads by asserting that she only ""knows one circle""—referring to the limited area she grew up in. This indicates that her sense of ""local"" is rooted in her **personal growth history** and **mental map** of the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""我小时候住大观园"" (""I lived in Daguanyuan when I was a child"") → RL3
  - ""最南到英雄山，最北到长途汽车站，东边到101终点站，最西到十二马路"" (""the southernmost point was Hero Mountain, the northernmost was the long-distance bus station, the easternmost was the 101 tram terminus, and the westernmost was Shierma Road"") → RL1
  - ""生活区域就这么点"" (""the living area was just this much"") → RL1
  - ""我只认识一个圈"" (""I only know one circle"") → RL1

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses her **childhood living experience** to establish the **emotional and experiential basis** of her ""local identity"" (RL3).
  - She defines her **mental map** of the local area through spatial boundaries shaped by her childhood movements (RL1).
  - Her limited ""circle"" is not portrayed negatively, but rather as a **symbol of authenticity**—suggesting that her local identity is tied to the area she actually lived in and experienced, not the whole city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL3 is clearly endorsed: the author uses her childhood residence and lived experience to define her sense of being a local.
  - RL1 is also endorsed: the author constructs a **personalized, experiential mental map** of the local area, which she implicitly defends as valid for defining her local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs her ""local identity"" through a **personal growth history** (RL3) and a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) that is subjective and experience-based, rather than administrative or functional.

最近又出了双层公交车，线路好像就是走历城区那块，我一个室友就是历程的，她拍了视频给我们特意强调这是她们那边的双层公交车，我很不能理解，双层公交我记得小时候经常坐，都不觉得是多么稀罕的东西了，然后双层公交没了几年，现在又出来了，她给我们几个小时候就经常坐的同学显摆，我们都不好意思说我们之前就坐过,RL3," The author is recounting a situation where a roommate is proud to show off a newly reintroduced double-decker bus service in the Licheng District, emphasizing that it belongs to ""her area."" The author and their childhood friends, however, remember riding such buses regularly when they were younger and thus don't find it impressive or uniquely tied to Licheng. The core expressive intent is to highlight a contrast in perception — the roommate sees the double-decker bus as something distinctive and new to her local identity, while the author sees it as an old, familiar experience, suggesting a more nuanced or longer-standing connection to the area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""历城区"" (Licheng District)** – a named geographical area, possibly related to RL1.
  - **""她那边的双层公交车"" (her area's double-decker bus)** – implies a sense of local ownership or distinctiveness, possibly related to RL1 or RL6.
  - **""小时候经常坐"" (used to ride often as a child)** – references early exposure or childhood experience, possibly related to RL3.
  - **""我们几个小时候就经常坐的同学"" (several of us who used to ride them as kids)** – again, emphasizes early experience, reinforcing RL3.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Licheng District / ""her area's double-decker""**: The roommate is trying to claim the bus as a symbol of her local identity. However, the author **implicitly resists** this, pointing out that the bus is not exclusive or new to Licheng. So while the roommate may be using **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** logic, the author **does not endorse** it.
  - **Childhood experience of riding double-decker buses**: This is central to the author’s point — they are asserting a **longer-standing local connection** than the roommate, based on having experienced the buses in the past. This **directly supports RL3**, and the author implicitly endorses this as a **criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not endorse** the roommate’s implied claim of **RL1** (territorial distinctiveness of Licheng).
  - The author **does endorse** the **childhood experience** of riding double-decker buses as a **marker of authentic local identity**, which maps clearly to **RL3**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The author emphasizes that they and their friends “used to ride them as kids,” suggesting that **early and repeated exposure** to a local feature (double-decker buses) establishes a **deeper, more authentic local identity** than the roommate’s current, possibly more superficial, pride in the new buses.

龙洞似乎并不介意自己属不属于济南市区，只知道自己最贵就可以了,"**  
RL6"," *   The author is making a sarcastic or ironic observation about how a place (龙洞, Longdong) defines itself not by administrative or conventional urban identity, but rather by its property prices — suggesting that it sees its ""value"" or status as a ""local"" area defined by being the most expensive, rather than by being officially part of Jinan city proper.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is “似乎并不介意自己属不属于济南市区，只知道自己最贵就可以了” — roughly translating to ""doesn't seem to care whether it belongs to Jinan's urban area, just knows that it's the most expensive.""
  *   This implies a **rejection of traditional or administrative identity markers** (RL1 and RL2), and instead **emphasizes property value or economic status** as a defining feature of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is **critiquing** or **highlighting** a shift in how ""local identity"" is defined — not by geography, history, or administration, but by economic value (specifically, property prices).
  *   This suggests that the author sees a new standard being used — one based on **economic status and property value as a symbolic marker of local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not explicitly endorse** this standard but is **highlighting it as a phenomenon**. However, the statement implies that **this is the standard that Longdong itself uses or is perceived to use**.
  *   The author **does not resist or negate** this standard in the statement; rather, they **observe it as a defining logic**, even if with a tone of irony.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The relevant RL category is:
      *   **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** — because the text **explicitly links property value (being the most expensive) to the definition of local identity**, suggesting that economic status or property ownership in a core area is being used as the **symbolic marker of ""local"" status**.

**Output:**  
RL6"
你画的小商品批发市场有汽车站有动物园的 也不算市区啊,RL1," The author is asserting that an area containing facilities like a wholesale market, bus station, and zoo is **not considered part of the “real” urban core** — implying a **symbolic boundary** between what is and isn't truly “local” or “central.” The tone suggests that merely having infrastructure or public facilities does **not** elevate the area to the status of “市区” (urban downtown), which carries a more **symbolically rooted, socially recognized status**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is:
  - “小商品批发市场有汽车站有动物园” (has a wholesale market, a bus station, and a zoo)
  - “也不算市区啊” (still not considered downtown/urban area)

  This implies that the author believes **possession of certain facilities or functions alone is insufficient** to define a place as part of the “市区” — suggesting a **symbolic or conventional understanding** of what constitutes a true urban area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mentioned facilities (wholesale market, bus station, zoo) are **urban functions**, but the author is **rejecting them as sufficient criteria** for defining a ""true urban"" or ""local core"" area. This implies that the author subscribes to a **socially conventional understanding of urban identity** — that some areas, despite having urban infrastructure, are not symbolically or cognitively recognized as part of the “real” city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **not** endorsing the idea that facilities define urban/local identity. Instead, they are **implying that there is a conventional or symbolic understanding of what constitutes a “true” urban area**, beyond just having public facilities.

  Therefore, the **author implicitly endorses a conventional or symbolic boundary** of what counts as ""市区"" — aligning with **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is not defining “local” in terms of administrative borders (RL2), family history (RL3), language (RL4), economic status (RL6), or occupation (RL7). Nor are they defining it purely by functional livability (RL5), although the facilities are mentioned, they are **explicitly rejected** as sufficient.

  Instead, the author is drawing on a **socially conventional understanding of urban identity** — that certain areas, even with urban functions, are **not symbolically recognized as part of the real city**. This is a **cognitive or symbolic boundary** — a **Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

很小的时候去济南，觉得历城就是郊区了，至于莱芜，我们本来就是刚合过去的，大多数的莱芜人在归属感上还是认同自己是莱芜人，个人观点不喜勿喷,"RL1, RL3"," The author is sharing a personal perspective on how they perceive the local identity and territorial boundaries in the context of济南 (Jinan), particularly with regard to历城 (Licheng) and莱芜 (Laiwu). The author suggests that while they once saw Licheng as郊区 (suburbs), they now recognize that most people from Laiwu still identify strongly with their original local identity (Laiwu) even after administrative integration into Jinan. The phrase “个人观点 不喜勿喷” (personal opinion, don’t attack if you disagree) suggests the author is aware their view may not be universally accepted but is expressing it as their own belief.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “很小的时候去济南，觉得历城就是郊区了” — This indicates a **mental map** or **regional perception**, where the speaker once saw Licheng as peripheral to the core of Jinan.
  - “至于莱芜，我们本来就是刚合过去的” — This refers to the **administrative change** (merging of Laiwu into Jinan), suggesting a reference to **administrative legitimacy**.
  - “大多数的莱芜人在归属感上还是认同自己是莱芜人” — This points to **cultural or psychological rootedness**, indicating that people from Laiwu still emotionally or socially identify with their original locality, not the broader Jinan identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The first part establishes a **personal historical perception** of regional boundaries, showing how the speaker once viewed parts of Jinan as non-core. This helps frame the idea that “local” identity is not always aligned with administrative definitions.
  - The second part discusses the **administrative integration** of Laiwu into Jinan, but the author implies that this change hasn't altered people’s **self-perception** or **local identity**.
  - The third part emphasizes **emotional and psychological attachment** to the original local identity (Laiwu), suggesting that this is a more authentic or enduring marker of local identity than administrative boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** administrative legitimacy (RL2) as a sufficient criterion for defining local identity — instead, they **question its effectiveness** by pointing out that people still identify as 莱芜人.
  - The author **does endorse** the **psychological and emotional rootedness** (RL1 and RL3) as stronger indicators of local identity.
  - There is also an implicit **mental map or regional cognition** (RL1), where Licheng was once perceived as suburban and peripheral, reinforcing the idea that people have internalized a sense of what is “central” or “core” Jinan.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author reflects on how they once viewed Licheng as “suburbs,” and implies that Laiwu is still perceived as separate by its residents — both are examples of socially constructed mental maps that define local identity.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** While not explicitly mentioning family history, the author suggests that people from Laiwu still feel rooted in their original identity, implying that personal history and emotional attachment (rather than administrative status) define local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

确实，我爸甚至还能分辨出东西南北四关的口音差异，到我连章丘和济南口音都分不出来，完全理解不了这么小的地方怎么会有口音差异呢,"** RL4, RL3"," The author is expressing a personal observation and sentiment: that their father can distinguish subtle regional accents (even within the local area, such as the ""four gates"" of the city), while the author themselves can no longer differentiate between accents from nearby places like Zhangqiu and Jinan. This reflects a **weakening of local linguistic identity across generations**, and the author seems to find it puzzling or slightly regrettable.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""分辨出东西南北四关的口音差异"" (able to distinguish accent differences of the four gates) — clearly relates to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  - ""章丘和济南口音"" (Zhangqiu and Jinan accents) — again, **RL4**.
  - The generational contrast (""我爸...到我..."") — implies a **change over time in linguistic sensitivity**, possibly reflecting **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author's own upbringing may have lacked deep local linguistic exposure.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author uses the ability to distinguish accents as a **marker of local identity and sensitivity**, contrasting their father's deep local awareness with their own lack of it. This implies that the author sees accent recognition as a **legitimate or traditional criterion** for defining local identity.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The contrast between the father and the author's experience hints at a **weakening of rootedness** over generations, suggesting that the author implicitly accepts **long-term local upbringing** as a basis for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL4** and **RL3** are used by the author to express a **personal reflection on the erosion of local identity**, indicating that they **implicitly endorse** these as relevant to defining ""local people"".
  - The author does not resist or negate these criteria; rather, they express a sense of **loss or confusion** over not possessing them.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author reflects on accent as a key marker of local identity, noting that their father could distinguish accents even within the city, implying that linguistic familiarity is a valued and accepted criterion.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The generational contrast suggests that being ""born and raised"" locally contributes to this linguistic sensitivity, and the author implies that this rootedness is a legitimate basis for local identity.

**Output:** RL4, RL3"
一部分在历下一部分在历城吧 高新不是行政区划啊,RL2," The author is making a distinction about the **administrative identity** and **territorial classification** of a certain area — specifically, pointing out that ""Gaoxin"" (High-tech Zone) is not an official administrative division, and that parts of the area belong to Lixia and Licheng districts. This indicates that the author believes **administrative legitimacy** is a key standard for defining the ""local"" identity or scope of an area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""历下"" (Lixia), ""历城"" (Licheng) — these are official administrative districts.
  - ""高新不是行政区划"" (Gaoxin is not an administrative division) — this is a **direct statement** about administrative legitimacy and classification.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **refuting** the idea that ""Gaoxin"" can be considered a valid administrative or local identity unit. They are **affirming** that only officially recognized administrative divisions (like Lixia and Licheng) should be used to define local identity or regional scope.
  - This serves to **clarify and define** the author's standard for what counts as ""local"" — based on **official, administrative boundaries**, not just functional or symbolic zones like high-tech development areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the correct way to define local identity and regional scope.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is emphasizing that ""Gaoxin"" (a functional development zone) does not have the same legitimacy as real administrative divisions like Lixia or Licheng. Therefore, to define local identity or regional scope, one should rely on **official administrative boundaries and divisions**, not just symbolic or functional zones.
  - This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, where the author uses administrative classification as the standard for defining local identity.

The key intent is to **categorize and distinguish these areas based on their perceived identity and livability**, and to **mark some as part of the ""city"" and others as not**, especially章丘, 长清, 平阴 are clearly seen as outside the urban core.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- The author implies that **certain districts are central to the city**, while others are peripheral or not part of the city at all.
- Districts are evaluated based on **facilities, convenience, and environmental quality** (e.g., ""设施齐全去哪里都方便"", ""绿化挺好"").
- The author's personal experience or familiarity with each area is mentioned (e.g., ""小时候买衣服长大了搞装修"").
- The author uses **common symbolic associations** (e.g., ""万达大观园老商埠"", ""大剧院西客站宜家"") to define the character of a district.
- There is a **clear distinction between urban and non-urban areas**, suggesting a **socially conventional mental map**.

**Step 3: Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The **mention of facilities and convenience** (RL5) functions to **evaluate the quality of a district**, which in turn contributes to the **author's perception of whether it is ""core"" or ""marginal""** within the city.
- The **use of symbolic landmarks and commercial centers** (RL1) helps the author define the **mental boundaries and symbolic identity of each district**, which is used to **categorize and rank the districts**.
- The **personal familiarity with areas** (RL3) supports the idea of **which areas are ""known"" and thus more ""local"" or central** to the city.
- The **clear distinction between ""市里"" and ""不在市里了""** reflects a **socially conventional understanding of territorial identity and mental mapping**, which is used to **exclude certain areas from the ""local city"" identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **clearly uses mental maps and socially conventional understandings** of which areas are central or peripheral to the city (RL1).
- The author **uses functional livability and environmental quality** (facilities, greenery, convenience) to evaluate the value or centrality of a district (RL5).
- The author **uses personal familiarity** with districts to imply who is more ""rooted"" or connected to the city (RL3), though this is **less central** than the other two.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL1** is strongly present: the author **constructs a mental map** of the city, distinguishing between central and peripheral areas, and **uses socially conventional labels and symbolic associations** to define these identities.
- **RL5** is also strongly present: the author **evaluates districts based on facilities, convenience, and environmental quality**, and **uses this to support their ranking of which areas are more ""city-like"" or ""local""**.
- **RL3** is present but **less central**: the author's personal experience with certain areas is used to imply a sense of belonging or familiarity, but not as a primary criterion for defining ""local"".

红谷滩，不过生活成本也相对高一些,** (none)," *   The author mentions ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan), a district in Nanchang City, implying a specific location or living environment. The phrase ""不过生活成本也相对高一些"" (""however, the cost of living is relatively higher"") expresses a personal observation or evaluation of the area's living costs.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""红谷滩"" —— This is a named urban area, possibly indicating a mental map or perceived identity boundary.
  *   ""生活成本也相对高一些"" —— This refers to the economic aspect of livability, suggesting that the area has higher living costs.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""红谷滩"" functions as a **named place**, but the author does not explicitly define who counts as ""local"" or what the local identity entails based on this name. It serves more as a **contextual reference** than a criterion for defining local identity.
  *   ""生活成本也相对高一些"" evaluates the area in terms of economic livability but **does not serve as a standard for judging local identity**. It is a **comment on cost**, not a definition of who is or isn't a local resident.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not** propose or endorse any criteria (territorial, administrative, historical, cultural, economic, etc.) to define ""local identity"".
  *   The mention of higher living costs does not imply that this is a **standard** used by the author to determine who qualifies as local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although ""生活成本"" (cost of living) might relate to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, the author does **not** use it to define or evaluate the scope or quality of a ""local"" area in a way that reflects their view on how ""local identity"" should be defined.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of any standard that defines or evaluates ""local identity"" or ""local areas"" in the author's argument.

**Conclusion:**  
The text expresses a **personal observation** about the cost of living in a specific area but does **not** provide or endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local"" areas.

啥叫市中心 和传不传统没关系啊 具有文化教育医疗商业在城市领先的地方才是市中心啊 cbd在哪哪就是呗,RL5**," * The author is challenging the idea that ""traditional culture"" defines the city center. Instead, they argue that the **functional and administrative-economic role** of an area — specifically, whether it hosts leading cultural, educational, medical, and commercial resources — determines if it is considered the ""city center"" (市中心). They also imply that the **CBD (central business district)** location defines the center, not historical or cultural convention.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""文化教育医疗商业在城市领先的地方"" → Points to **functional urban features** as defining the center → possibly **RL5**.
  * ""CBD在哪哪就是呗"" → Directly links the **CBD**, a functional economic-administrative concept, to the city center → possibly **RL2** or **RL5**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author rejects the idea that tradition (possibly RL1 or RL4) defines the center.
  * They **endorse** the idea that **functional urban centrality and administrative-economic leadership** (CBD, infrastructure, services) are what define the ""city center"" — a **functional legitimacy** criterion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **explicitly rejects tradition and culture** as defining the city center.
  * They **endorse** the **presence and concentration of key urban functions and facilities** (education, healthcare, commerce, CBD) as the **legitimate basis** for defining the center — which is directly linked to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as it emphasizes the **quality and centrality of facilities and services** in defining what counts as the city center.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author defines the city center not by history, culture, or social rootedness, but by **functional urban quality** — the **presence of leading facilities and services** that make a place the city’s core. This aligns with **RL5**, which involves evaluating or defining a region based on its **functional livability and environmental quality**, especially when these features are used to determine the region’s centrality or ""local"" status.

RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing their own **local identity rooted in generational presence and upbringing in a specific part of the city** (Nanchang). They reference **family history across three generations**, **childhood education at a specific local school (育新)**, and **historical changes in the city’s spatial perception** (e.g., 二七北路 was once considered suburban but is now part of the urban core). These are used to **illustrate their deep connection to the traditional “local” core and to affirm their status as a “real local”**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “家里三代都在市区” → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
- “市中心就是八一广场附近的商圈” → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
- “小时候念的育新” → RL3 or RL1 (could imply rootedness or local school culture)
- “二七北路都是郊区” → RL1 (implying historical mental maps and changing perceptions of local space)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The mention of three generations living in the city center and attending a local school strongly supports the author's **claim to authentic local identity**. It functions as a **key legitimizing criterion** for being considered a “true local”.
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author defines the “true” city center as the area around Bayi Square and notes how areas like Erqi Beilu have shifted from rural to urban in perception. This reflects a **shared or conventional mental map** that the author endorses and uses to **anchor their sense of local identity** and distinguish “real locals” from others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- Both **RL1** and **RL3** are **explicitly and implicitly endorsed** by the author and are used to **construct and affirm their own local identity**. These are not just background descriptions but **central to their self-positioning as a “real local”**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author identifies as a **“true local”** based on **deep-rooted family history (RL3)** and a **shared understanding of the city’s core area (RL1)**. These two elements work together to **legitimize their local identity** and distinguish it from others.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""中心地区"" (central areas) — potentially related to RL1 (socially conventional territorial identity), but not explicitly defining local identity.
  *   ""不同的地方不同的定位"" (different places have different positioning) — general observation, not directly about local identity.
  *   ""按照房价来"" (based on housing prices) — clearly links to economic valuation and potentially RL6 or RL5, depending on usage.
  *   ""红谷滩"" (Honggutan) — a specific area, but the key point is its association with high housing prices.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   The phrase “按照房价来” (based on housing prices) is **central to the author’s argument** — it is the **standard** used to determine which area is ""best.""
  *   This implies a **hierarchy among areas** based on **economic value**, which directly relates to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, where housing price, ownership of property, or economic status are used to evaluate the **authenticity or hierarchy of local identity**.
  *   While RL5 involves environmental or functional qualities, the author is not discussing livability but rather **economic valuation as a ranking mechanism**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **housing prices as a standard** for judging which area is ""best,"" which aligns with RL6’s focus on economic status symbolism and how it contributes to **perceived local hierarchy or value**.
  *   No other RL elements are directly used by the author to define or evaluate local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is **using economic status symbolism (housing price)** to evaluate **which area is considered the most desirable or ""top-tier"" local area**, which fits the **RL6** category.
  *   This reflects a belief that **economic value plays a role in determining local status or hierarchy**, even if not explicitly about personal identity.

**Output:** RL6"
老南昌人，现在从红谷滩区老城区还是习惯说“去市内”,"** `RL1, RL4`"," *   The author is describing a behavioral and linguistic habit among ""老南昌人"" (longtime Nanchang locals), who still refer to the old urban area as “市内” (the city center/in the city) even though they may now live in a different district like Honggutan. This reflects a **linguistically rooted perception of local identity** and an enduring **socially conventional mental map** of the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - Use of the term “老南昌人” (longtime locals) → potentially linked to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness).
  *   - Reference to traditional or habitual language use (“还是习惯说 ‘去市内’”) → **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  *   - Implicit contrast between current administrative location (Honggutan) and traditional mental map of “市内” → **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - The use of “老南昌人” emphasizes a **historical rootedness**, but the author does not directly link this to defining local identity — rather, it's more about who retains a certain perception.
  *   - The habitual use of “去市内” serves as a **marker of cultural-linguistic identity**, indicating how locals mentally distinguish the core city area.
  *   - The contrast between current location and traditional mental map shows how **local identity is tied to a socially conventional understanding of territory**, not current administrative or physical location.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - **RL1** is clearly endorsed — the author shows that “市内” still carries symbolic territorial meaning for locals, even when they live elsewhere.
  *   - **RL4** is clearly endorsed — the habitual speech pattern “去市内” is portrayed as a cultural-linguistic marker of local identity.
  *   - **RL3** is not directly endorsed — while “老南昌人” implies historical rootedness, the author doesn't frame it as the **basis** for local identity, but rather as a group that retains a certain perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author illustrates that **longtime locals** continue to mentally distinguish the **core local area** (“市内”) from newer districts, using **habitual language** that reflects **cultural-linguistic identity** and a **socially conventional mental map** of the city. These are not just personal preferences but symbolic markers of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

**Output:** `RL1, RL4`"
市中心是八一广场那边 所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散 说红谷滩的 真的笑死,** RL1," The author is expressing a clear and assertive view that the **true center of the city**—and by extension, the **core of local identity**—is the **Bayi Square area**, not Honggutan. They mock the idea of considering Honggutan as central, indicating a belief in a traditional, historically-rooted spatial identity for the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""市中心是八一广场那边"" – suggests a conventional mental map of the city center.
  - ""所谓的一环二环也是八一为中心往外扩散"" – reinforces the idea of Bayi Square as the symbolic and spatial core, with ring roads defined around it.
  - ""说红谷滩的 真的笑死"" – mocks the idea of Honggutan as central, showing resistance to a newer, possibly administrative or economically-driven redefinition of the city center.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **Bayi Square** as the **symbolic and spatial anchor** of the city, implying that it is the **historically and socially accepted center**, and thus the foundation of local identity.
  - The **mental map** based on Bayi Square serves to **distinguish authentic locals** (who recognize this center) from others.
  - The **mockery of Honggutan** as central implies a **resistance to newer administrative or economic redefinitions** of the city, which the author does **not endorse** as valid criteria for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses a **socially conventional territorial identity** based on **Bayi Square** as the city's center.
  - They **reject** administrative or economic redefinitions (e.g., possibly those that elevate Honggutan), so **RL2 is not endorsed**.
  - No mention of **language, family history, or economic assets**, so **RL3, RL4, RL6, and RL7** are not relevant.
  - Although there's an implicit contrast in **urban quality**, the author does **not define local identity** based on **livability or environmental quality**, so **RL5 is not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines the **local identity** through a **socially conventional territorial identity**, where the **Bayi Square area is the symbolic and spatial heart** of the city.
  - This reflects a **long-standing, shared mental map** that the author believes should be used to define what is truly ""local"".

**Output:** RL1"
红谷滩我小时候是荒郊野岭，后来新城区建起来了，现在如果你要拿出去比面子，用红谷滩那块没毛病，但是你要问我们本地人，市中心一定只会是八一广场，我小时候对南昌的记忆也一定是那边,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a personal and collective local identity perspective regarding what constitutes the ""real"" center of南昌 (Nanchang). While acknowledging the development and prestige of 红谷滩 (Honggutan) as a modern urban area, the author insists that the true ""市中心"" (downtown/central city) in the hearts of ""本地人"" (locals) is 八一广场 (Bayi Square). This reflects a belief that local identity is not just about current urban prestige but is tied to historical, emotional, and experiential connections to certain areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of **childhood memory** (""我小时候对南昌的记忆也一定是那边"") → **RL3**
  - Reference to **collective local identity** (""我们本地人"") → potentially RL1, RL3, or RL4
  - Emotional and experiential attachment to a specific area (""八一广场"") as the symbolic heart of the city → **RL1**
  - Distinction between new development (Honggutan) and traditional core (Bayi Square) → **RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author contrasts the newly built Honggutan with Bayi Square, not to critique urban development, but to emphasize that **true local identity is rooted in long-standing emotional and experiential ties** to traditional urban cores.
  - Childhood memories and a sense of belonging are used to **justify the symbolic legitimacy of Bayi Square as the ""true"" downtown**, not just administratively or functionally, but in terms of identity and cultural memory.
  - The phrase ""我们本地人"" (we locals) is not just a label but **serves to distinguish those with deep-rooted connections from those who are newly arrived or newly associated with the city**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **endorses** the idea that **growing up in a certain area (Bayi Square)** and having **long-standing emotional and experiential ties** defines local identity → **RL3**
  - The author also clearly **endorses** the **symbolic and emotional distinction between traditional and new urban cores**, and **defines the ""real"" local center based on historical and emotional legitimacy** → **RL1**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author defines the ""true"" downtown as Bayi Square, not because of administrative or functional reasons, but because of **socially accepted historical and emotional associations**. This reflects a conventional mental map that locals share.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author emphasizes that **personal childhood experiences in the old downtown** are central to defining who is a ""local"". This implies that **growing up in the traditional core area is a key criterion** for local identity.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
土生土长南昌人告诉你，南昌的市中心是东湖区八一广场中山路孺子路等那一片，红谷滩以前很荒废，后来发展起来的，所以红谷滩那边很多外地人，但现在确实红谷滩发展的很好,"RL1, RL3"," The author identifies as a ""native南昌人 (Nanchang person born and raised here)"" and is asserting a specific view on what constitutes the ""core area"" of Nanchang — specifically, the **东湖区八一广场中山路孺子路等片区 (Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road area)** — based on **historical rootedness and traditional recognition**. They contrast this with **红谷滩 (Honggutan)**, which they describe as previously ""荒废 (wasteland)"" and now developed with many **外地人 (non-locals)**, implying that despite its development, it lacks the traditional ""local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “土生土长南昌人” → clearly implies **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**
  - “市中心是东湖区……” → implies a **socially conventional mental map** of local identity and regional hierarchy → **RL1**
  - “红谷滩以前很荒废……但现在确实发展的很好” → used to **contrast developmental history and traditional identity**, not to define ""good area"" based on facilities, but to **distinguish ""authentic local"" from ""newcomer area""** → not RL5
  - “红谷滩那边很多外地人” → used to imply that Honggutan lacks traditional local identity, not because of occupation, but because of **migration and settlement history** → **RL3** again
  - No mention of administrative boundaries, language, occupation, or economic assets → **RL2, RL4, RL6, RL7 not applicable**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - **RL1** is used to define the ""true local core"" of Nanchang based on **socially accepted traditional understanding**, not just geography.
  - **RL3** is used both to **assert the speaker’s own legitimacy as a ""true local""** and to **distinguish others** (e.g., those in Honggutan) who lack that rootedness.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly endorses** RL1 (traditional core area) and RL3 (native, rooted identity) as **criteria for defining ""local people""** and distinguishing ""local areas"".
  - Other elements (like development status of Honggutan) are mentioned but **not used as criteria** for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that the ""true local"" is defined by **long-term rootedness in the traditional core area** — a combination of **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)**.
  - These two RLs function together to construct a **traditionalist, place-based definition of local identity**, excluding newly developed areas dominated by migrants.

**Step 6: Output Result**

说红谷滩是市中心真的觉得搞笑，就算不是土生土长的，听下交通广播都知道，从八一大桥去往红谷滩叫出城方向。,RL1," The author is expressing a **rejection of the idea that Honggutan (红谷滩) is the city center**, implying instead that it is on the periphery. They back this up with a **symbolic and functional observation**: traffic broadcasts refer to traveling from Bayi Bridge to Honggutan as ""leaving the city"" (出城方向), which the author sees as evidence that Honggutan is not truly part of the core ""local"" urban identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author refers to **traffic broadcasts**, which reflect **public, socially conventional spatial cognition**.
  - The phrase “出城方向” implies a **mental map or socially accepted understanding of urban boundaries**.
  - The author is not just stating a fact, but using it to argue about **what counts as the ""real"" city or local urban core**, thus touching on **local identity boundaries**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The use of traffic broadcasts is not just a neutral observation; it's **used as evidence** to support the author's claim that Honggutan is not part of the real city center.
  - This implies that the author believes **socially conventional spatial cognition** (i.e., how people mentally and collectively define the city) is a **valid standard for defining local identity and urban boundaries**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly rejects** the idea of Honggutan as the city center.
  - They **endorse the idea** that the **socially conventional understanding of city boundaries** (as reflected in traffic broadcasts) defines what is truly ""local"" or central.
  - This clearly falls under **RL1**, as it involves **socially conventional territorial identity** and **mental maps** used to define the scope and identity of the ""local"" area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is using **socially conventional spatial cognition** (traffic broadcasts labeling the direction as ""leaving the city"") to **argue against Honggutan being considered the city center**.
  - This reflects a **mentally mapped boundary** and **social consensus** about what constitutes the urban core, which the author uses to define the **local identity boundary**.
  - Therefore, the author is **endorsing RL1 logic** as a standard for defining ""local"".

**Step 6: Output Result**

老市中心和新市中心的区别，从小在红谷滩长大，以前是叫昌北的，小时候到处都是一片荒芜，鸟不拉屎的地方，都是说过了八一桥才是真南昌，所以去东湖那边都会说去南昌。后面红谷滩才慢慢开发起来，建了很多大厦，开设地铁，引入CBD，包括各级政府的迁移，也改名从红谷滩新区到红谷滩区了，现在说是南昌的市中心我觉得没毛病。,"RL1, RL2, RL5"," *   The author is expressing a transformation in their perception and social recognition of what constitutes the ""real"" or central part of Nanchang city. Initially, the traditional core (Donghu, east of Bayi Bridge) was seen as the only legitimate ""real Nanchang"", while the current Red Valley (Honggutan) was once considered peripheral and undeveloped. Over time, due to urban development (CBD, metro, government relocation), Red Valley has become, in the author's view, a legitimate and even current ""central"" part of Nanchang. The author's core argument is about the **evolving mental map and social recognition of what counts as the “local core”**, driven by both physical and administrative changes.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""从小在红谷滩长大"" → RL3 (individual growth history)
  *   - ""以前是叫昌北的"" → RL1 (historical label and changing perception of regional identity)
  *   - ""小时候到处都是一片荒芜，鸟不拉屎的地方"" → RL5 (negative environmental quality perception)
  *   - ""过了八一桥才是真南昌"" → RL1 (mental map and symbolic boundary of local identity)
  *   - ""去东湖那边都会说去南昌"" → RL1 (symbolic recognition of central identity)
  *   - ""建了很多大厦，开设地铁，引入CBD"" → RL5 (functional livability improvements)
  *   - ""各级政府的迁移"" → RL2 (administrative legitimacy)
  *   - ""改名从红谷滩新区到红谷滩区"" → RL2 (administrative boundary/status change)
  *   - ""现在说是南昌的市中心我觉得没毛病"" → RL1 (revised mental map and acceptance of new local core)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author's personal experience growing up in Honggutan (RL3) serves to ground their subjective transformation and lends credibility to their narrative. The historical name ""Changbei"" (RL1) and the perception of it being undeveloped (RL5) establish the initial marginalization of the area. The phrase ""过了八一桥才是真南昌"" (RL1) and referring to Donghu as ""南昌"" illustrate the dominant traditional mental map and symbolic boundary. The development of infrastructure (RL5), government relocation (RL2), and name change (RL2) are presented as **legitimizing forces** that changed the perception and status of the area. The final statement (RL1) reflects a revised mental map and a new consensus, indicating the author's acceptance of Red Valley as the new center.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the following as valid criteria for defining the new ""local center"":
        *   **RL1:** The revised mental map and symbolic boundary of ""central Nanchang"" now including Honggutan.
        *   **RL2:** The administrative change (government relocation and renaming to district) as legitimizing the new center.
        *   **RL5:** The functional development (CBD, metro, buildings) as supporting the area's status as a new center.
  *   RL3 (personal growth) is mentioned but **not used as a criterion** to judge others’ local identity, only to establish the author’s personal experience.
  *   RL4, RL6, and RL7 are not mentioned or implied.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author’s evolving perception of what counts as the ""real"" or ""central"" part of Nanchang is based on a **combination of administrative legitimacy (RL2)**, **functional development and livability (RL5)**, and a **shift in socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**. These elements collectively support the author’s argument that Red Valley has become a legitimate center of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1, RL2, RL5"
因为红谷滩新区不是行政区，是经济区哈哈哈哈，我现在淘宝里还有地址,RL2," *   The author is mocking or humorously pointing out that Honggutan New District is not an administrative district but an economic zone. This implies a subtle distinction in identity or legitimacy associated with being in a ""real"" district versus a functional or economic one. The mention of still having an address in the area on Taobao hints at a tension between formal recognition and lived or functional reality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""红谷滩新区不是行政区，是经济区"" —— This is a direct reference to the **administrative status** of the area, distinguishing between an administrative district and an economic zone.
  *   ""淘宝里还有地址"" —— This implies a **functional or lived connection** to the area, even if not officially recognized.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of administrative status (RL2) functions to question or mock the legitimacy of the area's identity or how seriously it should be taken in terms of local identity.
  *   The mention of still having an address in Taobao (RL5) indirectly implies a **functional use or lived experience** of the area, even if it lacks formal administrative recognition. However, the tone is humorous and not clearly endorsing RL5 as a criterion for defining local identity, just noting its presence.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not** affirming that economic zones are valid local areas or that functional address usage defines local identity. Rather, the author is **highlighting the irony or lack of legitimacy** due to the area's administrative status.
  *   However, the **core argument is about administrative legitimacy**, and the author is **implicitly critiquing the idea that economic zones should be considered local** in the same way as administrative districts.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is using **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** as a **core criterion** to question the local identity of Honggutan New District.
  *   The tone is ironic, but the **implicit standard being referenced is administrative division** as a determinant of local identity.

RL1, RL3"," *   The author is sharing a **personal narrative of urban development and change in Nanchang**, focusing on how the **city center shifted from the八一广场 (Bayi Square) area to Honggutan**, and how this transformation affected their perception of different areas and their own experiences growing up. The narrative includes a sense of **changing mental maps** and **regional identity**, especially with the **political center’s relocation**, and how areas once perceived as rural (like Changbei) became developed and integrated into the urban core.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - The idea of **八一广场** and **Donghu/Xihu districts** as the **traditional city center** → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**
  *   - Mentioning **Honggutan’s development**, **political center relocation**, and the **evolving perception of the city center** → **RL1**
  *   - The author's **personal experiences of going to different areas as a child**, and how those areas were perceived (e.g., Changbei as rural) → **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**
  *   - Mentioning how the **same area (Honggutan/New Jian) has transformed over time**, and the author’s **emotional connection and changed perception** → **RL1**
  *   - Mentioning **schooling in Xinjian No.2 High School**, and the **changing environment** (from muddy to developed) → **RL3**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - **RL1** elements are used to **construct a narrative of shifting mental maps** and **changing conventional understandings of what constitutes the ""city center""**, reflecting a **socially conventional sense of territorial identity** that evolves over time.
  *   - **RL3** elements are used to **ground the author’s personal connection to the city**, and to **illustrate how their own growth history aligns with the city’s transformation**, thus **supporting the idea of evolving local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - The author **clearly endorses a socially conventional and historically evolving understanding of territorial identity** (RL1), as they describe the shift from Bayi Square to Honggutan as a **change in the perceived city center**, not just a political or economic one.
  *   - The author also **implicitly endorses the idea that personal growth history in a place contributes to a sense of local identity** (RL3), as they reflect on their **schooling, family trips, and childhood experiences** shaping their perception of different areas.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - **RL1** is clearly present: the author discusses how the **city center** is not fixed but **evolves based on political and developmental shifts**, and how this **shapes people’s perception of local identity and territorial boundaries**.
  *   - **RL3** is also present: the author **uses their own life experiences in different parts of the city** to reflect on how **growing up in a place contributes to a sense of belonging and local identity**, especially in the context of urban transformation.

我老公南昌土著，说他小时候红谷滩就是一片荒滩。,"** RL3, RL1"," The author is sharing a personal anecdote about her husband's local identity as a ""Nanchang native"" (土著), and by extension, the transformation of the Red Valley Beach (红谷滩) area from a wasteland to presumably a developed urban area. The key point is that her husband's status as a ""local"" is tied to having grown up in the area **before** its development, implying a certain authenticity or rootedness in the place.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""我老公南昌土著"" → suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History): being a native implies deep local roots.
  - ""小时候红谷滩就是一片荒滩"" → this implies that the speaker's husband has a long-standing personal connection to the area, before it was developed, which again supports **RL3**.
  - The contrast between the past (荒滩) and likely present (implied development) also hints at a **changing perception of the local area**, possibly touching on **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), especially if the author is suggesting that the ""real"" local area or identity is tied to the earlier, undeveloped perception.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3** is central: the author is affirming that her husband is a ""true local"" because he was raised in the area long before it became developed. This is a classic form of ""localness"" defined by **personal history and rootedness**.
  - **RL1** may be secondary: the reference to the past state of Red Valley Beach could imply a contrast with current perceptions, suggesting that the ""true"" local identity is tied to the older, more ""authentic"" version of the area, which supports a conventional or emotional mapping of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3** is clearly endorsed: the author is emphasizing that her husband's upbringing in the area qualifies him as a ""local"".
  - **RL1** may also be endorsed, though more subtly: the implication that the ""real"" local identity is tied to the earlier, undeveloped state of the area suggests a conventional or emotional mapping of local identity that has changed over time.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is clearly present: the husband's status as a ""local"" is based on being raised in the area, which is a strong indicator of local rootedness.
  - **RL1** is also present, though less explicitly: the author is pointing out a change in the perception of the area, which may reflect a broader societal shift in how the ""local"" is defined, and implies that the ""true"" local identity is tied to the earlier, more authentic version of the place.

红谷滩租房死贵死贵 房价也是,N/A," The author expresses dissatisfaction with the high rental and property prices in Honggutan (红谷滩), indicating that it is very expensive to live there. However, the text **does not explicitly or implicitly suggest any criteria for defining ""local people""**. The author is commenting on economic factors related to housing costs, not on what makes someone ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is ""rent is super expensive"" (租房死贵死贵) and ""property prices are also [expensive]"" (房价也是). These relate to economic conditions and housing markets.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The high cost of living is the author's main complaint, but there is **no indication** that the author uses this to define who is or isn't a local. There is no mention of identity, belonging, boundaries, cultural traits, or administrative status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author does **not** define or evaluate ""local identity"" or ""local area"" using any of the RL criteria, **no RL elements qualify**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  There is no match with any RL category. The text expresses frustration about affordability but does not link this to a definition or evaluation of ""local"" identity or area.

**Step 6: Output Result**

黄明他妈我见过，标准的市里人，不是胶州口音,RL4," The author is asserting that 黄明's mother is a ""standard city person"" (标准的市里人), and this judgment is based on her not having a 胶州 accent. This implies that the author uses **linguistic and cultural markers**—specifically, accent—to distinguish who is considered a ""local"" (市里人 in this context).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “标准的市里人” (standard city person): This implies a definition or standard for who counts as local.
  - “不是胶州口音” (not a Jiaozhou accent): This is the key criterion used to support the judgment of being a ""standard city person"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase “标准的市里人” indicates that the author is evaluating someone’s local identity based on a standard they endorse or assume.
  - The key supporting reason is the **absence of a 胶州 accent**, which functions as the **cultural-linguistic criterion** the author uses to judge local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **linguistic identity (accent)** as a defining feature of being a ""local"" (市里人).
  - There is no mention of administrative identity, territorial boundaries, family history, or economic factors.
  - The author does not resist or negate this criterion; rather, they **endorse it implicitly** by using it to define someone as a ""standard city person"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author is using accent (a linguistic marker) to distinguish between local and non-local identity.

我也是城阳人，听到市里口音够够的，高贵的很,"RL1, RL4"," The author expresses a sense of local identity rooted in being from **Chengyang**, and contrasts this with a negative perception of the **urban (市里) accent**, implying that those with that accent are seen as **socially or culturally superior (""高贵的很"")**, and thus not part of the ""true local"" identity the author identifies with.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""城阳人"" (Chengyang native): Points to a specific local identity.
  - ""市里口音"" (urban accent): Suggests a linguistic distinction.
  - ""高贵的很"" (very high-class): Implies a value judgment linked to accent and possibly social class.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - ""城阳人"" functions as a **self-identification marker** and defines the author’s **local identity** based on **regional origin**.
  - ""市里口音"" is used to **distinguish outsiders** from the author’s local group and is **negatively evaluated**, suggesting that **accent is a key criterion** for judging localness.
  - ""高贵的很"" implies that those with the urban accent are **socially distant** and **not part of the local Chengyang identity**, reinforcing the author’s **linguistic and cultural boundary-making**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **uses regional identity (""城阳人"")** to define who is local.
  - The author clearly **uses accent (""市里口音"")** as a **criterion to exclude** others from being considered local.
  - The **negative tone** suggests that the author **resists** the social class implications of the urban accent, but still **uses accent as a boundary marker**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author identifies as a ""城阳人"", implying a **regionally defined identity** that is distinct from the urban center.
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** — The author uses **accent (""市里口音"") as a key marker** of local identity, suggesting that **linguistic difference is a core criterion** for defining who is local.

抱抱，反正在我眼里我只看行政区域划分，属于青岛那就是青岛人，管是胶州还是城阳，早些年因为交通不便利人们觉得隔着远就罢了，现在不管地铁还是开车一会就到了呀,RL2," The author's main viewpoint is that **administrative boundaries should be the sole criterion for defining ""local identity""** — specifically, if someone belongs to Qingdao administratively (e.g., has a hukou or is registered there), they should be considered a Qingdao local, regardless of which specific district they come from (e.g., Jiaozhou or Chengyang). The author also argues that **improved transportation (e.g., metro, driving) has reduced the perceived distance and thus should eliminate traditional distinctions between districts**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""属于青岛"" — clearly refers to **administrative affiliation**, suggesting the author uses administrative boundaries to define local identity.
  - ""胶州"" and ""城阳"" — refer to specific administrative districts within Qingdao, indicating a contrast between traditional local identity boundaries and modern administrative definitions.
  - ""地铁还是开车一会就到了"" — refers to **transportation improvements**, which the author uses to argue that traditional spatial or social boundaries should no longer be valid.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to **administrative affiliation (""属于青岛"")** plays a **central role** in the author's argument — it is the **main standard** used to define who is or is not a ""local"".
  - The mention of **districts (""胶州"", ""城阳"")** serves to **illustrate the diversity within Qingdao** and to **contrast traditional views of local identity** (based on sub-regional distinctions) with the **author's preferred administrative standard**.
  - The discussion of **transportation improvements** functions to **undermine traditional spatial or social boundaries** — the author implies that these distinctions are outdated and should not affect local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses administrative boundaries** as the standard for defining ""local identity"" — this corresponds to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - The author **implicitly critiques traditional spatial or cultural distinctions** (e.g., between Jiaozhou and Chengyang) — these are often associated with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**. However, the author is **not endorsing** these distinctions; rather, they are **arguing against** them. Therefore, **RL1 is not endorsed** by the author.
  - The mention of transportation and spatial integration is **not used to define local identity**, but rather to **support the argument that administrative boundaries should be the only standard**. Therefore, **RL5 is not directly endorsed** as a criterion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's **core belief** is that **administrative boundaries (e.g., belonging to Qingdao)** should be the **only valid standard** for defining local identity.
  - This clearly maps to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author explicitly uses administrative affiliation (""属于青岛"") as the **basis for defining ""local""**.
  - The author **rejects traditional distinctions** (e.g., between Jiaozhou and Chengyang), which are often based on **RL1 or RL4**, but does **not endorse** these as valid criteria.

而且莱西平度跟青岛持平的就剩口音了，别的方面跟青岛都有差距，胶州起码还有地铁机场,"RL4, RL5"," The author is making a comparative evaluation between different regions — specifically莱西 (Laixi), 平度 (Pingdu), and 胶州 (Jiaozhou) — and 青岛 (Qingdao), the central city. The key point being expressed is that aside from **accent (RL4)**, Laixi and Pingdu fall short of Qingdao in other aspects, and even **Jiaozhou surpasses them** in terms of infrastructure (e.g.,地铁 - metro, 机场 - airport), implying **functional livability (RL5)**.

The author is therefore constructing a **hierarchy of ""local"" areas**, where **accent is the only remaining similarity between certain peripheral areas and the core city**, while **infrastructure and urban development (RL5)** are used as **standards to judge the degree of ""localness"" or the quality of a local area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""口音"" (accent) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
- ""地铁"" (metro), ""机场"" (airport) → RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL4 (Accent):** The author uses accent as a **symbolic marker of cultural belonging**, indicating that only this aspect links Laixi/Pingdu with Qingdao identity. However, it is framed as **""the last remaining""**, suggesting it's **not sufficient** on its own to define a strong ""local"" identity.
- **RL5 (Infrastructure):** The author clearly treats infrastructure (metro, airport) as a **legitimate standard for evaluating the quality of a local area**. The lack of such infrastructure in Laixi and Pingdu is used to **justify their lower status in the local hierarchy**, while Jiaozhou is given a higher rank due to its infrastructure.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
Both RL4 and RL5 are used by the author to **evaluate and differentiate ""local"" areas**, with **RL5 playing a dominant role in the author's standard for judging ""local value""**. The author implicitly endorses infrastructure as a **more valid** or **higher-order** criterion than accent.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author acknowledges accent as a **symbolic link to local identity**, though it's framed as the **weakest or least significant** remaining link.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author **clearly uses infrastructure** (metro, airport) as a **benchmark for evaluating the ""local"" quality of a region**, and this is used to **justify the perceived hierarchy** between Qingdao, Jiaozhou, and Laixi/Pingdu.

画多了，应该就是市南+市北（不能过北岭水清沟）+崂山（不能过金家岭），这些才是青岛市里the city哈哈。----土生土长的青岛小嫚现在是老阿姨一枚,"RL1, RL3, RL4"," The author, identifying herself as a ""土生土长的青岛小嫚"" (native-born girl from Qingdao), is expressing a subjective delineation of what she considers the ""real Qingdao"" or the core ""local"" urban area. She draws a boundary by including **Shinan, Shibei (limited to areas south of Beiling and Shuiqinggou), and Laoshan (limited to areas west of Jinjialing)**, and excludes areas beyond these as not being part of the ""true"" city center. This is not just a description of geography but an assertion of **symbolic territorial identity** — who belongs to the ""real"" Qingdao and who doesn’t.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The mention of specific districts (Shinan, Shibei, Laoshan) and exclusion of areas beyond certain landmarks (北岭, 水清沟, 金家岭) suggests a **symbolic mental map** of local identity.
  - The self-identification as ""土生土长"" implies a **family historical rootedness** and personal growth history in Qingdao.
  - The tone and phrasing (""青岛市里"", ""the city"", ""哈哈"") imply a **cultural-linguistic in-group** — an insider using local logic to define insiders.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **symbolic mental map** (RL1) is central: the author is not just describing Qingdao but **defining who or what counts as ""local""** by drawing symbolic boundaries.
  - The **historical rootedness** (RL3) supports her authority to make this claim — she is a native and thus, in her view, has the right to define ""local"".
  - The **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) is subtly implied by the tone and code-switching (""the city""), suggesting an in-group identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly uses RL1** to define the scope of ""local"" Qingdao.
  - She **implicitly uses RL3** to establish her own legitimacy as a local.
  - She **implicitly uses RL4** through linguistic markers to signal in-group identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is directly used in the territorial delineation.
  - **RL3** is indirectly used to establish her own ""local"" credentials.
  - **RL4** is indirectly used through linguistic code-switching and humor to signal cultural belonging.

RL1"," The author is expressing confusion about a perceived social hierarchy between two urban districts — specifically, why the older, traditionally prestigious **Shinan District** (市南区) would look down upon the newer, more expensive **Laoshan District** (崂山区), even though the latter has newer infrastructure and higher property prices. The author draws a parallel with the **Puxi-Pudong** dynamic in Shanghai, where Puxi historically held more prestige despite Pudong’s modern development.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **district prestige and identity hierarchy** (Shinan vs. Laoshan)
  - Reference to **infrastructure/newness** (城建比较新的崂山区)
  - Mention of **property prices** (房价最贵的区)
  - Implicit comparison of **socially accepted identity or prestige** vs. **material or economic indicators**
  - The question implies that the author perceives a **socially conventional boundary or identity distinction** between districts

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **higher property prices in Laoshan** are presented as a **rational or economic indicator**, yet the author is puzzled that this doesn’t translate into **social prestige**.
  - The **social disdain** from Shinan toward Laoshan suggests a **non-economic, socially conventional hierarchy** — one based on **historical identity, prestige, or symbolic meaning** rather than material development.
  - The **comparison to Puxi/Pudong** reinforces that the author sees a pattern of **socially conventional territorial identity**, where older districts maintain symbolic dominance even in the face of newer, economically stronger ones.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse property prices** as the main criterion for local prestige — instead, they are confused that higher prices don’t equate to higher status.
  - The author **implies that historical or socially conventional identity** (i.e., being from an older, more established district like Shinan) is **what defines local prestige**, even more than modern infrastructure or wealth.
  - The author does **not emphasize administrative boundaries, family history, language, or occupation**, so those are not relevant here.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is implicitly endorsing the idea that **local identity or prestige is not determined by economic or infrastructural development**, but by **historically sedimented, socially conventional distinctions between areas**.
  - This maps directly to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author reflects or questions a **socially accepted hierarchy of districts** based on **historical prestige and symbolic meaning**, not just administrative or economic factors.

The author implies that such a hierarchy is unfounded, as many ""urban locals"" are not truly rooted in the city for long. They also point out that county-level cities outperform urban districts in education and economy, and that areas like 香港路 were once rural villages.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “土生土长青岛市南人” → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - “爷爷辈那辈才进城” → RL3 (Family history as a basis for local identity)
  - “胶南胶州没有老家的亲戚” → RL3 (Family roots in non-urban areas)
  - “幼儿园那阵还是小村庄” → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), implying change in perception of space
  - “市区的高考升学率一直被县级市的学校吊打” → Possibly RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), if linked to evaluation of urban areas
  - “县级市也出了很多驰名企业” → Possibly RL5 or RL6, if used to evaluate regional value or local status

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL3 elements are used to **challenge the legitimacy** of current local identity hierarchy by pointing out that many so-called locals are recent migrants.
  - RL1 element shows that **urban identity is fluid** and based on changing perceptions of place, undermining the idea of fixed local boundaries.
  - RL5 and RL6 elements are used to **refute the idea** that urban areas are inherently superior, thus challenging the basis of the contempt chain.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses the idea** that local identity should not be based on superficial or recent changes in geography or current economic/educational performance, but rather on **long-term rootedness**, which many urbanites lack.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** a broader, more inclusive definition of local identity that accounts for **family history and migration background**, and **rejects** criteria based on current urban status or economic performance.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** to argue that many urban residents are not truly ""local"" in the deeper sense, as their families only moved to the city recently.
  - The author uses **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** to highlight the **fluidity of urban identity**, showing that areas once considered rural are now part of the urban core, challenging rigid territorial boundaries.

Despite the child's **hukou (household registration)** being in **Pingdu**, and the father being a native Pingdu person (which implies deep **family historical rootedness**), the author insists the child identify as **Jinan people** (where they currently live) and **not as Qingdao people**, even though Pingdu is administratively part of Qingdao. The author is clear about **rejecting administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a basis for local identity and instead is actively shaping the child’s identity based on **residence and upbringing (implied RL3)** and **social-cultural affiliation (RL4)**.

The father's self-identification as Qingdao person and being laughed at by Qingdao locals implies a **cultural-linguistic boundary (RL4)** and a **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** — that is, **being from Qingdao doesn't automatically make you “one of us” unless you fit the cultural or social expectations**.

The author is constructing a **multi-layered local identity** that combines:
- **Current residence and upbringing (RL3)**: Teaching the child to say she's from Jinan.
- **Family history and origin (RL3)**: Emphasizing that her roots are in Pingdu.
- **Rejection of administrative identity (RL2)**: Despite the hukou and administrative reality, the author does not accept Qingdao identity.
- **Cultural self-positioning and boundary (RL4)**: The child must not say she's from Qingdao — implying a cultural distinction.
- **Socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**: There's a socially accepted notion that Pingdu people are not truly “Qingdao people” in some contexts.

**Step 2–Step 5: Filtering and Matching**
  Based on the author’s **core argument and active identity construction**, the following RL categories are **endorsed and functionally used to define ""local identity""**:

- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author implies that Pingdu people are not culturally accepted as Qingdao people, reflecting a conventional understanding of regional identity boundaries.
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The child’s identity is shaped by both her family roots (Pingdu) and current upbringing (Jinan).
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: The author is actively teaching the child to identify in a culturally specific way — not saying she's from Qingdao, suggesting that cultural belonging matters more than administrative or legal identity.

**RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is explicitly **rejected** by the author, so it is **not annotated**.  
**RL5, RL6, RL7** are not mentioned or implied in the author’s argument, so they are also **not annotated**.

The author interprets this as the origin of a kind of **local identity-based hierarchy or鄙视链 (hierarchy of disdain)**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""市南区"" (Shinan District)** —— a specific area that is symbolically contrasted with other districts.
  *   **""住楼房"" (lived in high-rise buildings)** —— a contrast in lifestyle and possibly economic status.
  *   **""别的区平房多"" (other districts had many single-story houses)** —— implies differences in residential form and potentially quality of life.
  *   **""交通不便利，出行远环境破旧"" (inconvenient transportation, distant travel, and dilapidated environment)** —— implies inferior functional livability in other areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is explaining the **basis of a local identity hierarchy** — that people from Shinan District looked down on others not just due to where they lived, but because of **the quality of the living environment and infrastructure**, which the author interprets as the root of a local鄙视链 (hierarchy of disdain).
  *   The author **does not personally endorse** the hierarchy but **explains its existence**, implying that **functional livability and environmental quality** (RL5) were **used by others** to justify a local identity distinction.

一开始论繁华便利市南是排不上的，后来市南拆迁改造之后就开始睥睨众生了，新建的配套什么的都比原先的好，就像现在的崂山一样,RL5," The author is discussing how the status and perception of a district (""市南"") changed over time — from being less prominent in terms of prosperity and convenience to becoming superior after redevelopment. They compare this transformation to that of another district (""崂山""), implying that the redevelopment brought about improvements in facilities and living conditions, which in turn elevated the district's status and possibly its ""local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of redevelopment (""拆迁改造"") and improved配套设施 (""新建的配套什么的都比原先的好"") — possibly related to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  - The implied evaluation standard that after redevelopment, a district becomes ""better"" or more ""local"" in terms of quality — also pointing to **RL5**.
  - The comparison to another district (""就像现在的崂山一样"") — possibly implying a shared standard of evaluation based on livability or redevelopment, still **RL5**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is evaluating the transformation of a district in terms of its **functional quality** and **livability** — not just physical improvement, but a **shift in perception and status**.
  - The author implies that **improved infrastructure and facilities** are **key to how a place is valued or seen as a ""local"" area worth living in**, suggesting that such improvements **enhance the local identity or the ""local value"" of the area**.
  - There is no mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, family history, or social networks — ruling out RL1–RL4 and RL6.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the **improvement in配套设施 (infrastructure/facilities)** as a **marker of progress and elevated local status**.
  - This aligns with the **RL5** category, which focuses on **functional livability and environmental quality as standards for evaluating a region's ""local"" value or desirability**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **after redevelopment and improved facilities**, a district like 市南 can rise in status and be seen as a **more legitimate or desirable ""local"" area**.

The text conveys frustration with how **mental maps and socially conventional distinctions** between areas have become **deeply ingrained in local identity definitions**, creating exclusion and hierarchy.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author describes **regional identity hierarchies** (老西镇 > 老台东 > 市南辛家庄).
  - Mentions of **long-standing regional identity markers** such as being a “土生土长的青岛人” (native Qingdao person).
  - Emphasis on **which areas are considered authentic or core local areas** (市内四区: 市南 > 市北 > 四方 > 李沧), and **which are excluded** (崂山、七区五市).
  - Implicit **mental mapping** of which areas ""count"" and which are ""outsiders"" or ""lesser locals"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements **construct the author's critique** of Qingdao's **local identity hierarchy**, which is **based on long-standing socially conventional perceptions of territory and belonging**.
  - The author **does not endorse** these criteria but **strongly implies that they are the basis on which many locals define and rank ""local identity""**.
  - These elements are **central to the author’s argument** about the **persistence of local identity-based exclusion**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Although the author **criticizes** the criteria, they are **explicitly described as the standards used by locals to define ""local identity""**.
  - The author’s critique is based on the **existence and persistence of these socially conventional criteria**, so they are **clearly part of the author’s expressed logic of how local identity is currently defined**, even if **not endorsed**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** clearly applies because the text centers on **socially accepted regional identity rankings**, **historical mental maps**, and **territorial boundaries** used to determine who is considered a “real local”.
  - The author **does not personally endorse** these views but **explicitly critiques them as the prevailing logic**, which still counts as **endorsed by the speaker in a descriptive sense** for the purpose of this task.

RL1, RL2, RL4"," The author is expressing a belief that莱西 (Laixi) and莱阳 (Laiyang) were historically part of the same region, and that there is a noticeable difference in dialect or accent between their area and others. The author appears to be reflecting on regional identity, using historical territorial relationships and linguistic differences as a basis for this reflection.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “莱西与莱阳以前好像是一块的” — RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity): Refers to a perceived historical or social unity between regions.
  - “莱西以前属于烟台” — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): Mentions administrative history.
  - “我感觉我们这边口音都不太一样” — RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition): Refers to dialect or accent as a marker of identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL1 helps establish a sense of shared regional identity or historical perception between Laixi and Laiyang.
  - RL2 supports this perception with administrative history, reinforcing the idea that these areas were once closely linked.
  - RL4 contrasts this unity with the current perception of difference, using linguistic identity (accent) as a distinguishing marker.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - All three elements (RL1, RL2, RL4) are used by the author to explore and define local identity. They are not resisted or negated but rather form the basis of the author’s reflection on how ""local"" identity might be shaped by historical, administrative, and linguistic factors.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author reflects on how local identity in this context is shaped by **historical territorial perceptions (RL1)**, **administrative history (RL2)**, and **linguistic differences (RL4)**. These elements work together to suggest that ""local"" identity is not only about current geography but also about historical, administrative, and cultural boundaries.

即墨也曾经归属过烟台。,RL2," The author is making a brief historical observation: that Jimo (即墨) was once administratively part of Yantai (烟台). This is not just a neutral geographical or historical statement—it implicitly carries weight in defining regional identity. The author is suggesting that this administrative history has implications for how ""local"" identity is constructed and perceived.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “曾经归属过” (once belonged to), which points to a **change in administrative affiliation**. This is a strong indicator of **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it refers to a past administrative boundary and affiliation that could influence the perception of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is not just stating a historical fact—they are using it to suggest that Jimo's identity is not fixed or purely tied to its current administrative placement. This implies that **administrative history is a valid or relevant factor in defining local identity**, and that identity can be contested or layered based on such changes.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly uses **administrative history** as a criterion to evaluate or question the boundaries of local identity. There is no negation or resistance to this criterion—it is presented as a meaningful point in the discussion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This fits **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses historical administrative affiliation (归属) to reflect on or challenge the current understanding of ""local"" identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

因为他们的地区名就是带市，平度市，通常他们说山东省平度市，但是归属青岛市。 但是出去的话就会说是青岛了。,"**  
RL1"," The author is describing how people from a specific area (平度市) identify themselves depending on context. While administratively it belongs to 青岛市 (Qingdao), and people will identify as ""from Qingdao"" when outside, they retain a more specific local identification within the broader city structure. The author implies that there's a **distinction between administrative belonging and self-identification**, and that **local identity is context-dependent**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""地区名就是带市，平度市"" – indicates a self-contained local identity with a formal name ending in ""市"" (city), suggesting a **mental map** or **symbolic boundary**.
  - ""归属青岛市"" – indicates administrative affiliation with Qingdao, which could relate to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - ""出去的话就会说是青岛了"" – suggests a **contextual shift in identity**, where local identity is adjusted depending on external audience, possibly reflecting **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ""平度市"" and its distinction from ""青岛市"" implies that **people from 平度 see themselves as distinct locals** within Qingdao but will **subsume that identity** when outside. This supports a **socially conventional** understanding of local identity boundaries.
  - The administrative fact of being part of Qingdao is **acknowledged**, but not the primary identity marker in all contexts, suggesting it plays a **background role** rather than a central defining one.
  - The author implies that **local identity is not purely administrative**, but shaped by **social convention and context**, indicating a **preference for RL1 over RL2**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1** is clearly endorsed and used to explain how people from 平度 define their local identity in relation to others.
  - **RL2** is mentioned as a fact, but the author suggests it's not the dominant logic used by locals themselves in defining identity — it is **acknowledged but not prioritized**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author suggests that while 平度市 is administratively part of Qingdao, **local people identify based on socially conventional boundaries** — they call themselves 平度人 locally but 青岛人 when outside. This reflects a **socially conventional understanding of local identity**, where **mental maps and context** shape identity more than administrative lines.

**Output:**  
RL1"
以前平度不在青岛范围 后来规划进去了,RL2," *   The author is expressing a change in the administrative or conceptual boundary of what is considered part of Qingdao, specifically mentioning that Pingdu was not originally included but was later incorporated into Qingdao's scope. The core expressive intent is about **how the definition of ""local"" (specifically, what counts as Qingdao) has changed due to administrative planning**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Key phrase: “**以前平度不在青岛范围 后来规划进去了**” (Pingdu was not originally within Qingdao's scope, but was later incorporated through planning).
  *   This implies an **administrative change** — a shift in what is considered part of Qingdao, likely for official or planning purposes.
  *   The key RL element here is the **administrative boundary change** and the **author's recognition of this change as significant in defining what counts as ""local"" (Qingdao)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not expressing personal identity or cultural belonging, but rather **an objective administrative change** that redefined the scope of what is considered Qingdao.
  *   The functional role of this statement is to **illustrate that the definition of ""local"" (i.e., what counts as Qingdao) is not fixed but has evolved administratively**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not resist** this idea — rather, they **acknowledge and convey** that Pingdu is now considered part of Qingdao due to planning decisions.
  *   The author **implicitly accepts this administrative boundary change as a valid basis for redefining local identity** (i.e., who counts as local Qingdao residents).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This fits **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author references an administrative boundary change (规划进去了 — incorporated through planning) as the basis for defining who or what counts as part of Qingdao.
  *   There is no mention of cultural identity, rootedness, or other RL types — the focus is strictly on **administrative legitimacy** as a defining criterion for local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
Output: RL2"
我见过一些平度人对我们潍坊归属感比青岛还强,N/A," *   The author is expressing an observation: some people from Pingdu (a city in Shangdong province) feel a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao.
  *   The key point is that this is **not a statement of the author’s own identity**, but rather an observation about how others (Pingdu people) emotionally or cognitively affiliate themselves with different cities.
  *   The author is noting a **subjective perception or emotional alignment** that differs from expected administrative or geographic proximity (i.e., Pingdu is closer to Qingdao but some feel closer to Weifang).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key elements are:
      *   **""归属感"" (sense of belonging)** – this implies a psychological or emotional boundary of identity.
      *   The cities involved are Pingdu, Weifang, and Qingdao – all within Shandong Province.
      *   The author is **not claiming** that Pingdu should be administratively part of Weifang or that it has historical ties to it, but rather that **some individuals feel more emotionally connected to Weifang**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The sense of belonging mentioned is **not used by the author to define who is or isn't local** to Weifang or Qingdao.
  *   The author is **not asserting** that Pingdu should be considered part of Weifang or that people who feel this way are ""more local"" to Weifang.
  *   The statement is more about **observing a phenomenon** – emotional or psychological identity that may not align with administrative or historical boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although the **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** category deals with emotional or historical boundaries of local identity, in this case, the author is **not endorsing or proposing** that Pingdu should be considered part of Weifang or that this sense of belonging is a valid or legitimate criterion for defining local identity.
  *   The author is not defining who is or isn’t a local; they are simply observing that **some people feel a stronger emotional tie to a city that is not geographically closest**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   None of the RL categories apply because:
      *   The author is not **endorsing** any specific criteria for defining local identity.
      *   There is **no assertion** about who counts as local or how to evaluate the scope or legitimacy of local identity.
      *   The statement is **descriptive**, not normative or evaluative, and does not reflect the author’s **own criteria** for defining ""local"".

The author implicitly defines their own ""local"" identity through long-term residence and life experience across various parts of Qingdao.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""在青岛土生土长二十五年了"" → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  *   ""从小在李沧长大"" → RL3
  *   ""父母家搬去了城阳"" → RL3
  *   ""市北住过"" → RL3
  *   ""现在住在李村"" → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), RL3
  *   ""公司在崂山"" → RL1, possibly RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  *   Implicit rejection of identity-based divisions among Qingdao locals → possibly resisting RL1 or RL4 if others use those criteria
  *   Implicit endorsement of personal integration across multiple districts as the basis for ""local"" identity → supports RL3

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author lists their life history across multiple districts to **assert that they are a local** and to **question the validity of any internal hierarchy** among Qingdao locals.
  *   The author **resists the idea of territorial-based identity divisions** (possibly RL1 if others use it to exclude), but **uses their own long-term, multi-district lived experience (RL3)** to construct a more inclusive local identity.
  *   The author implies that **living in Qingdao for a long time and across different areas** is a more legitimate basis for local identity than any socially conventional or administrative divisions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   RL3 is clearly endorsed: the author uses their **birth, upbringing, and long-term residence in Qingdao** as the foundation of their local identity.
  *   RL1 may be indirectly referenced, but the author **resists any strong territorial identity boundaries** that imply exclusion.
  *   No evidence of endorsing RL2 (hukou), RL4 (language), RL5 (livability), RL6 (social/economic roots), or RL7 (occupation) as identity criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's core argument is that they are a legitimate local due to their **deep personal history and integration across multiple districts of Qingdao**.
  *   This is most strongly aligned with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author emphasizes being **""born and raised""** in Qingdao and having lived in multiple parts of the city for a long time.

**Step 6: Output Result**

碰到过一个从外地搬来青岛的 住在市南区 觉得自己老高贵了 说什么李沧是城乡结合部 崂山全是拆迁户 莱西平度是偏远山区青岛土生土长本地人只会觉得我小岛岛哪都好 最爱我小岛岛,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a critical attitude toward a person who moved from outside Qingdao to Shinan District and adopts a sense of superiority over other parts of the city, particularly looking down on areas like Licang, Laoshan, and Laixi/Pingdu. The author contrasts this with the perspective of a “native Qingdao person” who loves the city as a whole and does not engage in internal regional discrimination. The core argument is that **true local identity is tied to emotional attachment and an inclusive perception of the entire city**, rather than using internal regional hierarchies to define who belongs.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * **“住在市南区 觉得自己老高贵了”** – Suggests a value judgment based on residential location (could imply RL5 or RL6).
  * **“李沧是城乡结合部 崂山全是拆迁户 莱西平度是偏远山区”** – Implies a **hierarchical mental map** of the city, where certain districts are seen as less “local” or less “central” (RL1).
  * **“青岛土生土长本地人只会觉得我小岛岛哪都好”** – Emphasizes **birth and growth in Qingdao** as a basis for authentic local identity (RL3).
  * **“最爱我小岛岛”** – Reflects **emotional territorial identity** and pride in the whole city (RL1).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The **hierarchical mental map** (RL1) is used by the outsider to exclude others and elevate themselves, which the author **criticizes**.
  * The **native Qingdao identity** (RL3) is used by the author to contrast with this exclusionary view and is **endorsed** as the authentic form of local identity.
  * The **inclusive emotional attachment to the whole city** (RL1) is **endorsed** by the author as the correct way to define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) – **endorsed** in the form of inclusive emotional attachment and rejection of internal hierarchy.
  * RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) – **endorsed** as a basis for authentic local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author clearly **endorses** a definition of local identity based on **genuine emotional connection to the entire city (RL1)** and **being born and raised in Qingdao (RL3)**. They **reject** the use of internal spatial hierarchies (RL1 in a different form) to exclude parts of the city or people from being considered “local”.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
我李村的，我一个胶州的同事，住在市南租房子，他说我李村不属于市区，笑死人了，后面我才知道他是胶州的。给我拽上了还。,"**

RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing indignation and mockery toward a colleague who claims that Licun (李村) is not part of the urban core, while the colleague himself is from Jiaozhou — a place even farther from Qingdao's city center than Licun. The author implies that **living in a certain area (and being from somewhere) affects one’s legitimacy to judge what counts as “市区” (urban core)** and who counts as a “local” or “urban” person.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “我李村的” — indicates the author’s own local identity rooted in Licun.
- “我一个胶州的同事” — introduces a contrast between being from Licun and being from Jiaozhou (a more peripheral area).
- “他说我李村不属于市区” — the colleague uses a certain logic to claim Licun is not part of the city center.
- “后面我才知道他是胶州的” — the author mocks the colleague’s own origin as even less “urban” than Licun.
- “给我拽上了还” — shows the author resists the colleague’s claim and mocks his pretentiousness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author is defending Licun’s status as part of the city and challenging the legitimacy of someone from Jiaozhou (a place with weaker urban status) to make such a judgment.
- The colleague’s judgment is based on **territorial identity and perceived urban hierarchy** (RL1), but the author mocks this by pointing out the colleague’s own background (from a more peripheral area).
- The author implicitly uses **family/historical rootedness** (RL3) — by identifying as “我李村的” — suggesting that local identity is tied to where one is from, not just where one lives temporarily.
- The colleague’s **residence in a central area (市南)** is contrasted with his **origin (胶州)**, implying that **residence alone isn’t sufficient** to define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author mocks the colleague’s claim that Licun is not part of the city, implying that **urban identity is not just about where you live now**, but also involves **where you are from** and **what areas are socially accepted as part of the city**.
- The author uses **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — by questioning the colleague’s authority to define what is/is not “市区”.
- The author uses **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — by identifying as “我李村的” and mocking the colleague who is “胶州的”, suggesting that origin matters in defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author’s argument hinges on **territorial perception and identity legitimacy** (RL1), and **personal rootedness in a place** (RL3) as the basis for defining who is “local” or who can judge the boundaries of “市区”.

李村属于即墨方言,RL4," *   The author is making a short but clear statement that 李村 (Li Village) belongs to the 即墨方言 (Jimo dialect) region. This is not a neutral geographical observation—it implies a cultural-linguistic boundary and affiliation. The author is **affirming** a specific cultural-linguistic identity for 李村, positioning it within the sphere of 即墨方言, which functions as a marker of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Key phrase: “属于即墨方言” — “belongs to the Jimo dialect”
  *   This clearly connects to **language and dialect**, which are central to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase “belongs to the Jimo dialect” is not just a linguistic observation; it is a **categorical assertion of identity affiliation**. It defines 李村 as part of a broader cultural-linguistic community, distinguishing it from areas outside that community.
  *   The author is **endorsing** dialect as a criterion for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is clearly **endorsing** the idea that dialect affiliation (即墨方言) is a valid basis for defining local identity.
  *   This is a **core RL4 criterion**, and it directly serves the author’s expressive intent.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This text fits **RL4** because it uses **linguistic identity** (specifically, dialect) as a basis for defining the local identity of a place and affirming its cultural belonging.

我潍坊人，平度以前属于潍坊过，所以现在还有一些老一辈平度人的对潍坊归属感比青岛强,"** RL2, RL1"," The author is expressing a perspective on regional identity, specifically that some older residents of Pingdu, despite its current administrative affiliation with Qingdao, still feel a stronger emotional connection to Weifang due to its historical administrative relationship. The focus is on how this historical administrative link influences the perception of ""local identity"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""平度以前属于潍坊过"" (Pingdu used to belong to Weifang) – points to historical administrative affiliation.
  - ""还有一些老一辈平度人对潍坊归属感比青岛强"" (some older Pingdu people feel more connected to Weifang than Qingdao) – implies a sense of emotional or identity-based attachment shaped by historical administrative ties.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The historical administrative status of Pingdu under Weifang is used to **explain and justify** the emotional or identity-based affiliation that some older Pingdu residents still feel toward Weifang today. This supports the author's core point: that **local identity is not only shaped by current administrative boundaries but also by historical ones**, especially among those with lived experience of those past affiliations.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that historical administrative relationships can shape local identity and emotional attachment. This is not presented as a rejected or resisted idea, but rather as a **valid explanation** for the identity sentiments of certain individuals.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – The author references a historical administrative relationship (""平度以前属于潍坊过"") and links it to a current sense of identity and belonging, suggesting that **administrative history plays a role in defining local identity**.
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author implies that **mental maps and emotional affiliations** are shaped by historical relationships and continue to influence how people define their ""local"" identity, even after administrative changes.

The text also subtly resists others' judgment about what defines ""local"" status, especially in the face of stereotypes (e.g., ""from the village to the city"", ""no heating in Jiaozhou""). The author implies that others are using certain criteria to question their local identity, which the author rejects.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""南土生土长"" → RL3 (born and raised locally)
  *   - ""嫁了胶州小伙子"", ""住胶州了"" → potentially RL3 (change in residence due to marriage), but author does not endorse this as a marker of local identity
  *   - ""市区有七八套房子"", ""胶州城阳也都有房子"", ""爸妈现在住崂山"" → RL6 (property ownership across different areas)
  *   - ""邻居都会说我终于从村里进城了"" → implies others are using RL1 (territorial hierarchy and symbolic boundary between village and city)
  *   - ""你在胶州是不是住不上有暖气的房子"" → implies others are using RL5 (infrastructure/livability) to judge local identity

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - RL3 (""南土生土长"") is used by the author as a **core argument** for their local identity.
  *   - RL6 (multiple properties) is **not explicitly used by the author to prove local identity**, but it is a **background fact** that contrasts with others' assumptions.
  *   - RL1 and RL5 are **criteria used by others** to question the author’s identity, but the author **rejects them**, implying they are **not valid criteria** in their own view.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Only **RL3** is clearly used by the author as a **valid criterion** for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's key point is that they are a local because they were ""南土生土长"" — born and raised in the local area. This aligns directly with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**. Other criteria (territorial, infrastructural, or property-based) are either used by others to judge local identity (and thus rejected) or not explicitly endorsed by the author as defining.

我即墨的，我到新青岛话地区我觉得顺即墨话很高贵。因为即墨话（包括崂山城阳李村平度南）才是正宗的青岛土著方言，新青岛话是外地移民讨生活跟土著人方言碰撞融合形成的。,** `RL4`," The author is asserting that **即墨话 (Jimo dialect)** and related dialects (such as those spoken in Laoshan, Chengyang, Licun, and Pingdu) are the **authentic native dialects of Qingdao**, and that **新青岛话 (New Qingdao dialect)** is a product of **linguistic fusion between migrants and native speakers**. This implies a hierarchy of local identity based on **linguistic purity**, with native dialect speakers being more authentically ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""即墨的"" – indicates the author's own local identity rooted in Jimo.
- ""即墨话...才是正宗的青岛土著方言"" – suggests a **linguistic-criteria-based** definition of local identity.
- ""新青岛话是外地移民讨生活跟土著人方言碰撞融合形成的"" – implies that the **new dialect is a result of migration and mixing**, thus distinguishing **original vs. new residents**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author uses **linguistic identity (dialect)** to distinguish between **authentic locals** and **later arrivals or migrants**, implying that **speaking the original dialect is a key marker of being a true local**.
- The author **endorses** the idea that the **original dialects (Jimo, etc.) represent a purer, more legitimate local identity**, and **resists** the idea that 新青岛话 is equally authentic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author clearly **endorses dialectical identity (i.e., speaking the original local dialect)** as a **key criterion** for defining who is a ""true local"" in Qingdao.
- This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which identifies local identity based on **language, accent, and cultural habits**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author believes that **speaking the original local dialect (Jimo, etc.)** is a **core standard** for determining who is a **""true local""** in Qingdao, and contrasts that with the newer, mixed 新青岛话.
- This reflects a **cultural-linguistic standard** for defining local identity, which is **explicitly endorsed** by the author.

They argue that despite being from another province (Liaoning), living in Huangdao (not considered central Qingdao by some), and not being descended from local fishermen, they have built a life in Qingdao through their own efforts—working, settling down, building social networks—and thus their presence and legitimacy in the city do not depend on being accepted by traditional locals. The author also challenges the idea that traditional locals (e.g., fishermen's descendants) have any real authority to define or gatekeep local identity.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""外地人"" (non-local person)**, **""辽宁的"" (from Liaoning)**, **""住黄岛"" (live in Huangdao)** → potentially related to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — because the text discusses the perception that Huangdao is not ""real"" Qingdao and that being from Liaoning disqualifies someone from being considered local.
  - **""房子在黄岛"" (house in Huangdao)**, **""安家落户"" (settled down)**, **""自己的生活圈子和朋友圈子"" (built life and social circles)** → potentially related to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** and **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** — because the author emphasizes personal settlement and social integration.
  - **""渔民的后代"" (descendant of fishermen)** → potentially related to **RL3** and **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** — because it refers to traditional local lineage and occupation.
  - **""去你青岛人开的饭店吃饭"" (eat at a Qingdao person's restaurant), ""菜市场青岛人的摊子"" (Qingdao person's stall at the market), ""坐个出租车是你青岛人开的"" (take a taxi driven by a Qingdao person)** → potentially related to **RL6** — because the author implies that economic power and consumer behavior give them leverage over traditional locals.
  - **""认知局限"" (cognitive limitation)** — indicates rejection of traditional views on local identity, but not itself an RL element.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Territorial Identity):** The author is aware that Huangdao is not considered ""real Qingdao"" by some (RL1 logic), but they **reject** this as a valid standard. Therefore, **not endorsed**.
  - **RL3 (Rootedness/History):** The author contrasts their own lack of local roots with the traditional ""fisherman's descendant"" identity. They **explicitly reject** this as a necessary condition for being considered local.
  - **RL6 (Social Roots & Economic Status):** The author emphasizes that they have **built their own social and economic presence**, and that traditional locals are **dependent on them economically** (e.g., in restaurants, markets, taxis). This is used to argue that **they do not need recognition from traditional locals** — this is a **strongly endorsed** RL6 logic.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** The author uses the image of ""fisherman's descendant"" to represent traditional local identity and contrasts it with their own status as a modern, economically active urbanite. This is used to **reject** the idea that traditional occupation defines local identity — therefore, **not endorsed**.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL6** is clearly **endorsed by the author** and used to **justify their claim** that they are legitimate members of the local community, not dependent on traditional recognition.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author argues that despite not meeting traditional territorial or familial criteria for being considered a ""local"", their **economic participation, consumer power, and social integration** (RL6) are what truly matter. They assert that traditional locals (e.g., fishermen’s descendants) are economically dependent on people like them and thus have no authority to deny their local status.

They emphasize that these were previously **equal-level cities**, with **distinct identities**, and that forcing them into the ""Qingdao"" identity is illogical and painful. There's a clear emotional and identity-based rejection of forced assimilation.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""近十几年行政合并了""** → Suggests administrative boundary changes → **RL2**
  - **""人家都是跟青岛平级的"" / ""大家都是市""** → Emphasizes previous equal administrative status → **RL2**
  - **""说话口音完全不一样 他部分习惯也不同""** → Linguistic and cultural differences → **RL4**
  - **""你就不是我 你为什么非得说是我？"" / ""你是我 那我是谁？""** → Identity boundary assertion based on long-standing difference → **RL1**
  - **""大家都是平级市区 不分上下""** → Rejection of hierarchy due to long-standing separation → **RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author is **rejecting** the idea that recent administrative changes legitimize identity assimilation. The administrative merger is seen as **superficial and not identity-transforming**.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Used to **support the argument** that these are truly different groups — different accents and customs — so forcing identity unity is unnatural.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author **strongly endorses** the idea that these cities have long-standing, socially recognized separate identities. The emotional pain comes from the **violation of this socially conventional mental map**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL2:** Rejected by the author as a valid basis for identity.
  - **RL4:** Endorsed as a **legitimate basis** for distinguishing local identities.
  - **RL1:** Strongly endorsed as the **core basis** for defining local identity — the mental map and social recognition of these as separate places.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that **despite administrative changes (RL2 rejected), people from these cities are not ""Qingdao locals"" because of long-standing socially conventional distinctions (RL1)** and **cultural-linguistic differences (RL4)**. These are the **core standards** the author uses to resist forced identity assimilation.

They emphasize that the ""local"" identity is tied to a specific **historical and cultural continuity** within the **geographical scope of the traditional即墨 (Jimo) county**, which excludes modern subdivisions like **Pingdu, Laixi, Jiaozhou, and Huangdao**. The author further clarifies that their definition of ""Jimo"" is not just a modern administrative label, but refers specifically to the **historical Jimo county from the Sui dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty**, characterized by **unified dialect, culture, and customs**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to **historical continuity** and **geographical identity** (""自古以来"", ""从隋朝开始一直到清末"")
  - Emphasis on **cultural and linguistic unity** (""人文方言文化习俗统一"")
  - Rejection of **modern administrative divisions** (""不要说平度那个即墨"", ""除平度莱西胶州黄岛以外的所有青岛地区"")
  - Definition of ""土著"" (native/local people) based on **historical territorial belonging** and **cultural continuity**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Historical Territorial Identity (RL1):** The author is constructing a **non-modern, historically rooted territorial identity** for ""Jimo"" that **excludes current administrative boundaries**, emphasizing a **long-standing social and cultural perception** of where the ""real locals"" come from.
  - **Cultural-Linguistic Recognition (RL4):** The phrase ""人文方言文化习俗统一"" is central to the author's argument. It defines the **criteria for ""local identity"" not just by geography or birth, but by shared cultural and linguistic traits**, which the author sees as the **core marker of being a ""real local""**.
  - **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2) – Rejected:** The author explicitly **resists modern administrative definitions** (""不要说平度那个即墨"") and instead proposes a **non-contemporary administrative or cultural boundary** as the legitimate one.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **endorses** the **historical-cultural territorial identity** of Jimo and **uses it to define who the ""real locals"" are**.
  - The author **emphasizes cultural and linguistic unity** as the **defining feature** of the local group.
  - The author **rejects administrative legitimacy** as a valid basis for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author defines ""local people"" based on a **historically sedimented, culturally unified region** that is not aligned with modern administrative boundaries. This reflects a **socially conventional, emotionally and historically rooted territorial identity**.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author **explicitly ties local identity to shared cultural and linguistic traits**, using this as the **main criterion** to distinguish ""real locals"" from others.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL1, RL4`"

RL1, RL2, RL5"," The author is describing social dynamics and identity-based prejudices among college students from different suburban areas of Qingdao (Jiaozhou, Chengyang, Jiaonan, Jimo, Huangdao). The narrative centers around how these individuals **judge each other's ""local"" status** and even apply these judgments to **romantic relationships**, based on **administrative status (whether an area is a district)** and **perceived regional prestige**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""城阳舍友说胶州不属于青岛（说胶州没划为区）"" —> **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**
  - ""胶州舍友说城阳啥啥都没有"" —> **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**
  - ""胶南即墨被划为区"" —> **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**
  - ""胶州舍友气半死在宿舍说胶南穷为啥不把胶州划进区"" —> **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**
  - ""城阳舍友就特别希望找市南市北区男朋友"" —> **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
  - ""城阳舍友嫌男生是黄岛的"" —> **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is not just describing personal preferences or administrative facts; they are illustrating how **local identity is socially constructed and hierarchized** based on **administrative boundaries** and **socially accepted notions of regional prestige**. These elements are **explicitly used by the characters to judge each other's local status and social worth**, and the author presents this as a real and impactful dynamic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  All of the above RL elements are **presented as real and influential criteria** within the narrative. The author does not resist or negate them; rather, they are used to **construct the social reality being described** — how people **use administrative and conventional criteria to define and judge ""local"" identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2** is used when characters judge whether a place is ""part of Qingdao"" based on whether it is an administrative district.
  - **RL5** is used when characters evaluate areas as ""having nothing"" or being ""poor"", which is then **linked to their perception of local identity legitimacy**.
  - **RL1** is used when characters express **conventional territorial preferences** (e.g., preferring someone from Shinan/Shibei), implying that these areas are more authentically ""local"" or prestigious.

These collectively show how **administrative legitimacy and conventional territorial identity**, sometimes **mediated through perceptions of functional quality**, are **used by the characters — and accepted as meaningful by the author — to define local identity**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

RL1, RL2, RL5"
我老公认识我的时候，说他是黄岛的，拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系～很长一段时间我单纯的以为黄岛是一个单独的地方，跟青岛没关～,RL1**," The author is sharing a personal anecdote about how her husband initially refused to associate Huangdao (黄岛) with Qingdao (青岛), which she naively believed for a while. The underlying idea is that there is a perceived distinction — whether social, cultural, or identity-based — between Huangdao and Qingdao, and that this distinction matters enough for someone to distance themselves from the broader ""Qingdao"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase ""拒不承认跟青岛有任何关系"" (refused to admit any connection with Qingdao) implies a **mental or identity boundary** between Huangdao and Qingdao.
  - The author's surprise or misunderstanding indicates that this boundary is **socially meaningful**, not just administrative or geographical.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The refusal to associate with Qingdao functions as a **statement of local identity differentiation** — suggesting that being from Huangdao carries a distinct identity that the speaker wants to preserve or emphasize.
  - This supports a **socially conventional territorial identity** logic, where people emotionally or cognitively distinguish their local identity from a broader regional label.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument**
  - The author does not reference administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or functional livability.
  - The **core idea** is that Huangdao is **perceived as separate from Qingdao in social or identity terms**, which aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's narrative reveals that **people in Huangdao may emotionally or socially distance themselves from Qingdao**, treating it as a separate identity or place. This supports the **RL1** logic where **local identity is shaped by socially accepted or conventional mental maps**, not just administrative facts.

**Output: RL1**"

RL1, RL2"," The author is expressing frustration or protest against what they perceive as an unfair or incorrect perception or treatment of **Jiaodong Airport** (located in **Jiaozhou**) as being too far from the **Qingdao urban area** and thus inconvenient. The author challenges this by pointing out that if the urban area refuses to accept Jiaozhou as part of it, then logically, people shouldn't refer to **Weifang Airport** as being part of the Qingdao urban area. The author is defending the idea that **Jiaozhou should be considered part of Qingdao**, and that its residents should be recognized as **locals**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author refers to **Jiaozhou** and its relationship to **Qingdao** and **Weifang** — this touches on **territorial identity** and **administrative boundaries**.
  - The argument is based on **geographic belonging** and the **logical consistency of calling a place part of a city**.
  - The author implies that if Jiaozhou is excluded from Qingdao, then the use of Weifang Airport as a proxy for Qingdao is inconsistent — suggesting that **administrative or territorial definitions** should be respected.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The **territorial identity** aspect is used to argue that Jiaozhou should be considered part of Qingdao, and thus its residents are locals.
  - The **administrative boundary** logic is used to challenge inconsistent treatment or perception — the author implies that if a place is **administratively part of a city**, it should be accepted as such in terms of local identity.
  - The author **does not endorse** or imply that cultural, linguistic, or economic factors are the basis for defining local identity in this case.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — they are defending the idea that Jiaozhou is part of Qingdao and should be accepted as such.
  - The author also implies **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — they are using the logic that if a place is administratively part of a city, it should be recognized as such in terms of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - **RL1** is matched: the author defends the conventional territorial understanding of Jiaozhou as part of Qingdao.
  - **RL2** is matched: the author challenges the inconsistency of excluding Jiaozhou while accepting Weifang as part of Qingdao, implying administrative legitimacy is the correct standard.

这个鄙视链是在老一辈那，因为当时青岛交通不发达，只有市南市北住人多，李沧黄岛是农村种地多。,RL1**," *   The author is describing a historical social perception or ""hierarchy of identity"" among different districts in Qingdao, which was shaped by the city's underdeveloped transportation and the concentration of population in Shinan and Shibei districts. The author implies that areas like Licang and Huangdao were considered less ""local"" or peripheral due to their rural, agricultural nature at that time.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""市南市北住人多"" (more people living in Shinan and Shibei) → potentially related to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) and **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  *   - ""李沧黄岛是农村种地多"" (Licang and Huangdao were mostly rural with farming) → potentially related to **RL1** and **RL5**.
  *   - ""鄙视链"" (hierarchy of disdain) → indicates a **social perception or symbolic ranking** based on regional identity, which is central to the author's argument.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The contrast between urban (市南市北) and rural (李沧黄岛) areas is used to explain the **historical basis of social perception and symbolic ranking** of local identity. The author is not merely describing economic or functional differences but is explaining how these differences were used to **construct a symbolic boundary** between ""true locals"" and others.
  *   The author **does not endorse** the hierarchy but explains that it **existed among the older generation**, and was based on **territorial perception and symbolic identity**, not necessarily administrative or legal boundaries or economic status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not endorsing the hierarchy but is explaining how **local identity was symbolically constructed** based on **territorial perception** (urban vs. rural, settlement density), which reflects a **socially conventional understanding** of what constitutes the ""core"" and ""peripheral"" areas of Qingdao.
  *   The author implicitly conveys that **territorial perception** (urban vs. rural, settlement density) was used as a **criterion for defining ""local people""** in the past.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The key logic is that **territorial perception and symbolic ranking** (urban vs. rural, settlement density) were used to define **who counts as ""local""** in Qingdao in the past. This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects **historical and socially sedimented mental maps** of local identity.

This reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** shaped by common usage and informal mental maps rather than administrative definitions. The author also clarifies that this perception is not based on discrimination but on **linguistically and culturally conditioned everyday language**, which can lead to **cognitive ambiguity** in defining regional boundaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author discusses how certain areas (Pingdu, Jimo) were perceived as part of Qingdao during their childhood.
  - This perception is not based on administrative boundaries but on **common speech and habitual thinking**.
  - The author compares this with similar perceptions about other cities (e.g., Shouguang not being seen as part of Weifang), indicating a **pattern of conventional regional cognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 elements** (conventional territorial identity) are central to the author's argument — they are describing how **socially accepted mental maps** shaped their understanding of what constitutes ""Qingdao"" or ""local"" in a non-official, emotional sense.
  - The **RL4 elements** (cultural-linguistic recognition) are also implied, as the author links this perception to **everyday language and usage**, which contributes to the formation of **informal regional boundaries**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2)** or historical rootedness (RL3), nor do they mention cultural habits (RL4), although language plays a **supporting role** in shaping the perception.
  - The author **does not mention economic status (RL6), occupational symbolism (RL7), or environmental quality (RL5)**.
  - The author clearly **endorses RL1** as the **main logic** for defining the ""local"" in their childhood perception.
  - The author also **implicitly endorses RL4**, as they suggest that **everyday language usage contributes to the formation of regional identity perception**, even if it's not based on formal criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is clearly present: the author describes how certain areas were seen as part of Qingdao in everyday usage, reflecting a **socially conventional mental map** of local identity.
  - **RL4** is also present but more **indirect**: the author attributes the confusion or perception to **common language usage**, suggesting that **linguistic habits shape regional identity**.

我外地人在青岛生活十多年，公里公道说句，其实日常生活中青岛人没有表现出来青岛区域歧视，但是在偶有的聊天或者一些言论里，能看出来多少会带点儿那种感觉，比如他们会特指一些，像说那个沧口曼儿，或者说青岛话的口音，会问你家哪个区的，城阳的，哦，怪不得，你们懂那种感觉吧，但毕竟我不是青岛人，就听他们聊天中就会有那种地域划分和主城区优越感的只字片语，倒是说不上歧视什么的,"**  
RL1, RL4"," The author is a long-term resident from outside Qingdao, reflecting on their experience living there. While they acknowledge that Qingdao locals do not overtly display regional discrimination, they observe subtle indications of local identity and perceived superiority in casual conversations—such as emphasizing specific districts (e.g., Cangkou), using Qingdao dialect, or distinguishing people based on which district they are from. The author perceives an implicit sense of **local identity boundary and主城区 (main urban area) superiority**, but stops short of calling it outright discrimination.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""青岛人"" (Qingdao locals) — indicates a defined group
  * ""沧口曼儿"" (Cangkou people) — implies internal regional distinction
  * ""青岛话的口音"" (Qingdao dialect accent) — linguistic differentiation
  * ""你家哪个区的"" (Which district are you from?) — internal territorial identity
  * ""城阳的，哦，怪不得"" (From Chengyang? Oh, that explains it) — implies stereotyping or cultural distancing based on district
  * ""地域划分"" (regional division) — author perceives an implicit local identity boundary
  * ""主城区优越感"" (Main urban area superiority) — suggests perception of a hierarchy among locals

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The distinctions based on **district identity** and **dialect** serve to illustrate how Qingdao locals **implicitly define ""local identity""** through **territorial and linguistic boundaries**.
  * The **internal regional distinctions** (e.g., Cangkou, Chengyang) function as **RL1 markers**, showing that the locals have a **mentally mapped hierarchy of localness**, where certain districts are perceived as more ""authentically local"".
  * The **use of Qingdao dialect** functions as an **RL4 marker**, suggesting that **linguistic identity plays a role in determining who is considered a ""true local""**.
  * The **implicit主城区 (main urban area) superiority** functions as a **symbolic boundary**, reinforcing the **socially conventional territorial identity** that the author observes but does not personally endorse.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not personally endorse** the criteria used by Qingdao locals to define local identity.
  * However, the author **explicitly describes** and **implicitly accepts the existence of** these criteria as **real mechanisms** used by locals to **construct local identity boundaries**.
  * Therefore, the RL elements are **endorsed in the descriptive sense** — the author sees them as **operative criteria in the local social context**, even if they don't personally agree with them.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author notes how locals use **district identity** and **internal regional distinctions** to define who is considered local, indicating a **socially conventional mental map** of localness.
  * **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The use of **Qingdao dialect** and **accent** is a **key marker** that locals use to distinguish insiders from outsiders, suggesting **linguistic identity** is part of the local identity framework.

Despite acknowledging the city's lack of modern infrastructure and economic development, they emphasize an enduring emotional connection to the local culture, food, and lifestyle.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- **Mentions of birthplace and lifelong residence:** ""土生土长平度人，具体点是平度南村人""
- **Residential mobility within the local area:** ""高中搬家到一中附近""
- **Local traditions and seasonal consumption of local produce:** ""过年买草莓、樱桃节、吃西瓜、大泽山葡萄、仁兆白菜、古岘芹菜""
- **Emotional attachment and nostalgia for local food and shops:** ""想念南村街里的水果摊烧饼铺，想念平度温州路汽修厂的油条，想念小时候妈妈去平度办事绕到帝王给我带回一盒新出的肯德基蛋挞""
- **Observation of economic shortcomings:** ""没有一个大型综合性商超，也没有什么高新产业经济带，甚至现在连财政都岌岌可危""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The **birthplace and long-term residence** establish the author's legitimacy as a ""local"" based on rootedness and generational experience.
- The **detailed references to local food, traditions, and small businesses** serve as cultural and emotional anchors, reinforcing a sense of belonging and local identity.
- The **acknowledgment of economic underdevelopment** does **not** negate the author’s sense of local identity; rather, it contrasts emotional attachment with material lack, highlighting that local identity is not defined by economic or infrastructural criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author explicitly states they are ""土生土长平度人"" and grew up in Nancun, later moving within Pingdu. This clearly reflects a personal history-based definition of local identity.
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The detailed descriptions of local traditions, seasonal foods, and specific shops indicate a strong cultural identification with Pingdu, which the author sees as central to their local identity.
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author makes distinctions between specific sub-areas within Pingdu (e.g., Nancun, Yungshan, Mingcun, Dafushan, Renzao, Guxian), implying a nuanced, socially conventional understanding of local geography and identity.
- **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** Although the author mentions the lack of modern infrastructure and economic development, they **do not endorse** these as criteria for defining local identity. Instead, they **reject** them in favor of emotional and cultural ties, so **RL5 is not annotated**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
The author defines ""local people"" primarily through **deep-rooted personal and cultural experiences**—growing up in specific parts of Pingdu, participating in local traditions, and maintaining emotional ties to local food and places. These are clearly aligned with **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** and **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**. Additionally, the author’s **detailed knowledge and pride in sub-area identities** (Nancun, Yungshan, etc.) reflect a **socially conventional mental map** of local identity, aligning with **RL1**.

 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。","**

RL1, RL2, RL4, RL6"," The author is critically analyzing how certain groups in Qingdao (particularly ""Qingdao aunties"") define who is or isn't a ""real Qingdao person,"" highlighting the social, cultural, and structural mechanisms behind such exclusionary identity logic. The author opposes this form of symbolic exclusion and critiques the criteria used by the dominant group to define ""local identity.""

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text includes several elements:
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author discusses the symbolic and psychological boundaries of ""local"" (e.g., ""城阳不算青岛""), indicating that certain areas are culturally or socially excluded from being considered the ""real"" local area.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author contrasts administrative boundaries (""行政上各区市都属于青岛"") with social perceptions, implying that administrative identity is not sufficient for being considered a ""local.""
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Not directly endorsed by the author, but referenced as part of the broader social perception (e.g., local residents in certain areas being native-born).
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author discusses dialect differences and how they contribute to a sense of local superiority or identity.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author references income disparities and implicitly ties them to how areas are perceived or valued, though not directly used to define ""local identity.""
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author critiques how economic disparities and social privilege are used to construct local identity.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** Not directly mentioned or endorsed by the author.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1:** Used to show how psychological and symbolic boundaries are drawn, reinforcing the author's critique of exclusionary identity logic.
  - **RL2:** Used to contrast with social perceptions, emphasizing that administrative belonging does not equate to social recognition as a ""local.""
  - **RL3:** Not explicitly endorsed by the author, but referenced as background context.
  - **RL4:** Used to explain one of the mechanisms through which identity exclusion is enacted—language and accent as markers of local authenticity.
  - **RL5:** Referenced in terms of economic disparity but not directly used to define ""local identity.""
  - **RL6:** Used to show how privilege and economic status contribute to the construction of local identity and exclusion.
  - **RL7:** Not present.

  - **RL1:** Symbolic and psychological boundaries of ""local"" identity.
  - **RL2:** Contrast between administrative belonging and social perception.
  - **RL4:** Dialect and language differences as markers of local identity.
  - **RL6:** Economic and social privilege as symbolic markers of ""local"" authenticity.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author critiques the logic used by some Qingdao residents to exclude others from ""local"" identity, and in doing so, highlights the RL criteria that are used in this exclusionary process. These include:
  - **RL1:** The symbolic and psychological mapping of ""real Qingdao"" that excludes certain districts.
  - **RL2:** The contrast between legal/administrative belonging and social belonging.
  - **RL4:** Dialect differences as a marker of local identity.
  - **RL6:** Economic and social privilege as a basis for claiming ""local"" status.

RL1, RL6, RL7"," The author is suggesting that highly educated returnees (like the person being addressed) are particularly admired in certain areas (e.g., Shinan or near subway stations), where many aunties (middle-aged women) would be eager to marry their daughters off to such individuals. The underlying idea is that high educational attainment is a socially valued trait in certain local contexts, influencing perceptions of desirability and possibly local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""海归硕士"" (overseas returnee with a master’s degree): Indicates high education level and international experience, possibly linked to social status.
  - ""市南"" (Shinan): A specific district, possibly indicating a socially recognized area with its own identity.
  - ""地铁溜一圈"" (taking a walk around the subway): Implies a public space with social interaction, possibly symbolizing accessibility and visibility.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of “海归硕士” serves as a **symbol of high educational and cultural capital**, which is **valued locally** and enhances social desirability.
  - “市南” and “地铁” are **geographically and socially significant locations** where such social interactions are likely to occur, possibly indicating areas where local identity is more traditionally or socially defined.

我是李村的，感觉可能很多人对青岛有争论可能是对“青岛”这个所谓的概念站在不同角度去理解的。仅从个人的认识来说，如果说是市的层面，我的观念感觉城阳即墨胶州西海岸都可以说是青岛，平度莱西确实是有点太远了，总感觉名义上的，我确实对那边缺少同在一个青岛的归属感。如果说是岛的层面，那我认为红岛和黄岛肯定不属于青岛，这三个应该是并列的，青岛的话我认为城阳的流亭以南，加上市内四区的范围都叫青岛。,RL1," *   The author is expressing a personal understanding of what constitutes ""Qingdao"" (青岛), emphasizing that the concept can be interpreted differently depending on the perspective — whether administrative, geographical, or based on personal identity. The author draws distinctions between areas they consider integral to Qingdao (e.g., Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, West Coast) and those they do not (e.g., Pingdu, Laixi), and further refines their view from a more specific geographical perspective (the ""island"" level), distinguishing Qingdao from Hongdao and Huangdao.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""市的层面"" (city-level perspective), ""城阳即墨胶州西海岸"" (Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, West Coast), ""平度莱西"" (Pingdu, Laixi), ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) → relate to **RL1**.
  *   - ""名义上的"" (nominal) → relates to **RL2**, as it implies a question of administrative legitimacy or labeling.
  *   - ""岛的层面"" (island-level perspective), ""红岛"" (Hongdao), ""黄岛"" (Huangdao), ""流亭以南"" (south of Liuting), ""市内四区"" (four central districts) → relate to **RL1**, as they define the symbolic or conceptual boundaries of ""Qingdao"" based on a perceived mental map or conventional understanding.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author uses **RL1** to construct a layered understanding of ""local identity"" — distinguishing between different areas based on conventional or perceived boundaries. The sense of belonging and mental mapping are central to how the author defines who or what is ""Qingdao"".
  *   The mention of ""名义上的"" (nominal) suggests a critique or awareness of administrative definitions, but the author does not adopt **RL2** as a defining standard for local identity.
  *   The ""island-level"" perspective is not about administrative boundaries but about a symbolic or historical conceptualization of Qingdao, reinforcing **RL1**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly endorses **RL1** as the main logic for defining local identity — based on perceived boundaries, conventional understanding, and emotional belonging.
  *   **RL2** is referenced but not endorsed as a standard for defining ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author’s argument revolves around how ""Qingdao"" is defined not just administratively but through a conventional, emotional, and symbolic lens. They distinguish between areas that ""feel"" like part of Qingdao and those that don’t, and further refine the concept using a geographical-island framework. This aligns with **RL1**.
  *   There is no endorsement of administrative or legal definitions (**RL2**) as the basis for local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL1`"
完蛋，我们都是郊区人,RL1," *   The phrase ""完蛋，我们都是郊区人"" (translated roughly as ""We're done for, we're all suburbanites"") expresses a sense of identity crisis or social evaluation tied to being labeled as someone from the **suburbs**. The author uses the term ""suburbanites"" to imply a lower status or marginalization, suggesting that being from the suburbs is viewed negatively in the context of defining ""local people"". The tone implies a sense of **resigned identity or exclusion**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is “郊区人” (suburbanites), which implies a **territorial identity** and potentially a **social distinction** between urban and suburban residents.
  *   The use of “我们都是” (we are all) suggests a **shared identity** or **collective experience** of being excluded from a more central or privileged ""local"" identity.
  *   This may relate to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a socially accepted or habitual understanding of spatial hierarchy and local identity.
  *   There may also be implications for **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, if the label “suburbanites” carries connotations of lower economic status or weaker social integration.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase “郊区人” functions as a **symbolic marker of marginalization**—it is used to highlight the **exclusion** of the speaker and others from a more central, possibly more valued, “local” identity.
  *   The author does not resist this label but rather accepts it with a tone of resignation, implying that they **acknowledge** the societal logic that places suburban residents at a lower tier in the local identity hierarchy.
  *   The use of “we” implies **collective identity and shared experience**, reinforcing the idea that this territorial label is used to **categorize and evaluate** who counts as a ""true local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that being from the suburbs disqualifies one from being seen as a “core local”.
  *   This aligns with **RL1**, as it reflects a **socially conventional mental map** that distinguishes between urban and suburban identities and assigns different values to them.
  *   While there may be implications of economic or social status, the text does not explicitly or strongly imply **RL6**—it’s more about **territorial perception** than economic or social capital.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses the label “郊区人” (suburbanite) to express a **shared sense of marginalization** in terms of local identity.
  *   This reflects a **socially conventional understanding** of who is considered “local” in a spatial and symbolic sense.
  *   The author does not resist this logic but rather accepts it as a given, indicating that they **acknowledge** the **territorial hierarchy** embedded in local identity discourse.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
何止交通？医疗教育购物等等,RL5," *   The author is emphasizing that beyond transportation, other aspects such as medical care, education, and shopping are also important. This implies that the author sees these functional livability factors as significant in evaluating a place — possibly in defining what makes a place a ""local"" area or in judging its ""local"" quality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""医疗教育购物"" (healthcare, education, shopping) — these are elements of **functional livability** and are linked to the evaluation of a region's quality and suitability for living.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of these elements suggests that the author believes **functional livability factors** are key in evaluating the overall quality of a local area.
  *   The author implies that **transportation is not the only standard** for judging a local area — other aspects like healthcare, education, and shopping facilities are equally important.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly endorses the **importance of functional livability** — such as medical care, education, and shopping — as standards for evaluating the quality of a local area.
  *   This aligns with the **RL5** definition: using functional livability (transportation, commercial facilities, public services, etc.) to evaluate or define ""ideal local residential areas"" or the ""local value"" of a region.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is expanding the criteria for evaluating a ""local"" area beyond just transportation, to include other aspects of daily life and public services.
  *   This reflects the author's belief that **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition** plays a central role in defining or assessing what makes a place truly ""local"" in terms of livability and suitability for residents.

**Step 6: Output Result**

乖乖，住城墙里头的是天龙人吗？讲话都这么吊了，其他都是乡下人哈哈哈,"** RL1, RL4"," *   The author is expressing surprise and sarcasm at the perceived arrogance or superiority of people living inside the city wall (""城墙里头"") based on their speech style (""讲话都这么吊了""), and contrasts them with people outside the wall, whom they jokingly label as ""乡下人"" (rural/countryside people). The text implies a perceived social or identity hierarchy based on location of residence and speech, suggesting that the author sees the ""city wall"" as a symbolic boundary between ""local elites"" and others.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""城墙里头"" — suggests a territorial or symbolic boundary.
  *   ""讲话都这么吊了"" — implies linguistic or cultural superiority.
  *   ""乡下人"" — implies a social or spatial hierarchy and outsider status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   ""城墙里头"" functions as a **symbolic territorial boundary** that the author uses to distinguish a group perceived as more elite or entitled — this aligns with **RL1**.
  *   ""讲话都这么吊了"" implies that **language or speech style** is a marker of identity and status — this aligns with **RL4**.
  *   ""乡下人"" is used as a contrastive label for those **outside the symbolic boundary**, reinforcing the idea of a local-outsider divide based on space and speech — again reinforcing **RL1** and **RL4**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not explicitly endorsing these as their own criteria but is **highlighting and mocking** a social perception that is **implicitly accepted or prevalent**. Since the author uses these criteria to **construct the local/non-local distinction**, they are valid for annotation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author uses the city wall as a symbolic boundary to distinguish between those who are seen as superior locals and others, indicating a conventionalized spatial identity hierarchy.
  *   **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The tone and style of speech are used as a criterion to judge someone's status or identity, implying that speaking in a certain way marks one as a superior ""local"".

按以前的行政区块，至少老下关、秦淮区城墙外的部分、雨花、建邺相当于城乡结合部，2000年以前仙林大学城那边还有不少农田的,"RL1, RL2"," The author is reflecting on how certain areas in Nanjing — such as **Xiaguan (下关), the outskirts of Qinhuai District (秦淮区), Yuhua (雨花), and Jianye (建邺)** — were historically perceived as **urban-rural fringe areas** (城乡结合部) based on **administrative divisions of the past**. They further note that **Xianlin University Town** was still largely agricultural before 2000, implying a transformation over time. The author's main intent is to **highlight how administrative boundaries and historical development have shaped perceptions of which areas are considered “local urban core” versus peripheral or transitional**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- Mention of **historical administrative divisions** (“按以前的行政区块”): RL2
- Reference to **specific named areas (老下关, 秦淮区城墙外的部分, 雨花, 建邺)**: RL1
- Description of **urban-rural fringe perception (城乡结合部)**: RL1
- Mention of **land use change over time (农田 → urban development)**: RL1 or RL5 (but not used to evaluate quality, so RL5 not applicable)
- Temporal marker “2000年以前” implies **historical perspective and development change**, possibly linked to **RL1 and RL2**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author uses **past administrative boundaries** (RL2) to explain how certain areas were **classified** and **perceived** as **less central or transitional**, which contributes to a **mental map or perception of local identity** (RL1).
- The reference to **urban-rural fringe** is not just about physical space but implies a **cognitive or social boundary**, reinforcing the idea of **local identity being tied to perceived centrality and administrative history**.
- The mention of **agricultural land transforming into a university town** supports the idea that **what counts as ""local"" changes over time**, and that **identity is historically and administratively conditioned**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **explicitly uses administrative boundaries (RL2)** to **frame the discussion** and **explain local identity perception**.
- The author also **implicitly accepts a socially conventional mental map (RL1)** of which areas are considered ""core"" vs. ""fringe"", and how that affects the **definition or perception of ""local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: The author refers to **past administrative divisions** as a basis for understanding **which areas were considered local or not**, and how **identity affiliation** was shaped by **where an area was administratively classified**.
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author constructs a **mental map of local identity**, distinguishing between **core urban areas** and **urban-rural fringe**, implying that **local identity is tied to perceived centrality**, which is **historically sedimented and socially accepted**.

以前城墙以内，现在按行政区划。如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了，太小。现在南京全部加一起也不大，再减就没啦,RL2," *   The author is discussing the **evolution of the definition of ""local"" in Nanjing**, particularly how the scope has changed from being limited to the area ""within the city walls"" to being defined by **administrative boundaries**. The author seems to **endorse this change**, arguing that sticking to the old definition would make Nanjing too small to be considered a significant city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""以前城墙以内"" (previously within the city walls) — implies an older, more restricted territorial identity.
  *   ""现在按行政区划"" (now according to administrative divisions) — points to a current, broader definition based on official boundaries.
  *   ""如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了"" — suggests that the old definition is no longer sufficient and implies a **change in social or administrative perception** of what constitutes the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The reference to ""以前城墙以内"" is **not endorsed** by the author as a valid current standard; rather, it is used to **contrast** with the modern administrative boundary definition.
  *   The phrase ""现在按行政区划"" is **endorsed** and presented as a **more reasonable or legitimate** way to define the scope of the city/local area.
  *   The author is making a **normative claim** that the local identity should be defined based on administrative legitimacy rather than traditional or limited territorial understanding.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **rejects** the old RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) based on historical, wall-defined boundaries.
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) as the current and appropriate standard for defining the local area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that people should use **administrative divisions** (RL2) to define what counts as Nanjing or ""local"", rejecting the outdated idea of city walls. This is a **normative endorsement** of administrative legitimacy as a defining feature of local identity.

城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is recalling a personal memory about growing up outside the city wall and referring to the act of going to Fuzimiao (a famous historical area in Nanjing) as ""entering the city."" This implies a psychological or symbolic boundary between the area outside the wall and the recognized ""urban core"" — Fuzimiao. The phrase ""进城了"" (""entered the city"") suggests that the speaker perceives a distinction between the inside and outside of the city wall, with the latter being more central or authentic in terms of urban/local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""城墙外"" (outside the city wall) — hints at a spatial boundary or mental map.
  - ""小时候住那边"" (lived there as a child) — indicates personal history and upbringing in a specific area.
  - ""去夫子庙都说进城了"" (going to Fuzimiao is referred to as ""entering the city"") — implies a conventional understanding of where the ""city"" or ""local core"" begins.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""城墙外"" sets the spatial context and contrasts it with the perceived core city area.
  - ""小时候住那边"" provides a personal history that helps establish the speaker's relationship with the area and supports the idea that living in a certain place from childhood may influence one’s perception of being “local.”
  - ""进城了"" is the key evaluative expression — it shows that there's a **socially conventional understanding** of where the city begins, and that entering Fuzimiao is symbolically entering the ""real city"" or ""local core.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implies that there is a **socially conventional understanding of the city boundary** (i.e., Fuzimiao is ""the city"" and outside the wall is not), which supports **RL1**.
  - The author also references their **personal upbringing** outside the wall, which could imply that growing up in a place doesn't necessarily equate to being “in the city” — this supports **RL3**, though the author doesn't strongly assert that upbringing alone defines local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is clearly supported by the conventional understanding of the city boundary and the symbolic meaning of ""entering the city"" when going to Fuzimiao.
  - **RL3** is indirectly referenced through the author's childhood residence, but not strongly asserted as a defining criterion of local identity — rather, it serves to contrast with the conventional boundary.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
以前交通不发达 所以才觉得城墙内才是主城区 比如过去的白下区的同学就很少去下关区 因为远,RL1," *   The author is reflecting on how the perception of ""main urban area"" was historically shaped by transportation limitations and that areas within the city walls (e.g., the former Baixia District) were traditionally seen as the core, while areas outside (e.g., Xiaguan District) were not frequently visited or considered part of the main city due to physical distance and lack of convenient transport.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""城墙内才是主城区"" – implies a spatial definition of the local core area.
  *   ""白下区的同学就很少去下关区"" – reflects a social or spatial boundary between districts.
  *   ""因为远"" – indirectly suggests that physical distance and accessibility influenced the perception of what is considered local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase “城墙内才是主城区” functions as a historically rooted perception of the core local area, based on long-standing spatial and social habits.
  *   The reference to students from Baixia rarely going to Xiaguan reflects an implicit spatial boundary that contributes to a socially conventional understanding of local identity and territorial scope.
  *   The reason “因为远” supports the idea that physical accessibility historically reinforced these spatial identity boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author implicitly endorses a historically sedimented, socially conventional understanding of the ""local"" urban core.
  *   There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family history, language, economic status, or other RL categories.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a long-standing, socially accepted mental map that defines the ""local""主城区 based on historical spatial habits and perceived boundaries.

RL1"," The author is reflecting on how, during their childhood, the perception of distance between different parts of the city (specifically from Chengnan to Ruijin Road/Jiefang Gate) was considered very far due to inconvenient transportation. This implies a **nostalgic or reflective view of how local geography was once perceived differently**, especially in terms of **mental maps or regional cognition**, shaped by the transportation conditions of the time.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **specific locations**: ""城南"" (Chengnan), ""万象城"" (Wanxiang City), ""瑞金路解放门"" (Ruijin Road/Jiefang Gate), and ""城墙城南到城墙城东"" (from Chengnan to Chengdong along the city wall) — indicating **territorial identity and spatial cognition**.
  - The idea of **""好远啊"" (so far)** and **""交通实在不便利"" (transportation was really inconvenient)** — suggesting **a historical perception of local space** based on accessibility and lived experience.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The locations and the spatial perception (""好远啊"") serve to illustrate how the **mental map of the city was shaped by the transportation limitations of the time**, which influenced the **subjective understanding of local geography**.
  - The author is not criticizing or resisting this perception; rather, they are **describing it as a once-prevailing local cognitive framework**.
  - The **inconvenient transportation** is not just a general complaint about infrastructure; it's used to **explain why certain parts of the city were seen as distant or disconnected**, thereby shaping **how locals mentally divided or understood their city**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses the **mental map or spatial cognition** of the city as fragmented or distant based on historical transportation conditions.
  - This supports a **socially conventional territorial identity**, as it reflects how people **historically perceived and mentally mapped their local environment**, reinforcing **cognitive boundaries** between different parts of the city.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author reflects on how **mental maps and spatial perceptions**, shaped by historical transportation conditions, were used to **cognitively segment and define the local area**.
  - The author does not endorse administrative boundaries, family history, cultural-linguistic markers, or economic factors as defining local identity in this context.

nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,RL1," *   The author is asserting that **""we Jianye is rural""**, and emphasizes this identity by describing the **physical and symbolic boundary** of ""crossing a river and bridge and entering the city wall"" to enter the city. This implies a **self-identification with the ""local"" rural identity** and a distinction from the urban core. The phrase ""进城要过河过桥进城墙"" suggests a **symbolic boundary** between Jianye and the city center, reinforcing a sense of regional identity and boundary perception.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""建邺是乡下"" (Jianye is rural) – This is a **regional identity definition**, possibly pointing to RL1 or RL5.
  *   ""进城要过河过桥进城墙"" (To enter the city, one must cross a river and bridge and enter the city wall) – This is a **symbolic boundary** description, suggesting a **historical or conventional understanding of territory**, possibly RL1.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""建邺是乡下"" – This is **not just a description of the area's quality**, but a **self-identification with a rural local identity**, used to define who belongs to the ""local"" group (in contrast to the urbanites).
  *   ""进城要过河过桥进城墙"" – This is not just a physical description, but a **symbolic boundary** that reinforces the author’s perception of Jianye as a distinct region with its own identity, and **implies a mental map** of ""us vs. them"", ""local vs. city"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly identifies Jianye as rural**, and **implicitly accepts the idea of a symbolic boundary** (river, bridge, city wall) that defines the local identity and distinguishes it from the city.
  *   These are **not descriptions of quality of life, nor are they resisted criteria** – they are **endorsed identity markers**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author defines Jianye as rural and implies a **symbolic boundary** (river, bridge, city wall) that distinguishes Jianye locals from the city dwellers. This is based on **historical or conventional territorial perception**, not administrative or functional criteria.
  *   **RL5 is not applicable** – Although ""rural"" might imply certain environmental or functional characteristics, the author is not using that to judge the area's quality or livability, but to **define local identity**.

小时候家里人都以城墙为界，城墙外都是郊区,RL1**," *   The author is conveying a personal childhood perception of regional identity, shaped by family teachings that distinguish between the ""inside"" and ""outside"" of the city wall. This distinction suggests a **symbolic boundary** that defines what is considered truly ""local"" versus peripheral or non-local, based not just on geography but on **socially conventional understanding**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase ""以城墙为界"" (""use the city wall as the boundary"") is central. It implies a **symbolic mental map** of local identity and spatial belonging.
  *   The phrase ""城墙外都是郊区"" (""everything outside the wall is suburbs"") further reinforces this symbolic boundary and suggests a **socially accepted cognitive framework** for distinguishing local from non-local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   These statements are not just descriptions of geography or childhood memory — they **reflect an inherited worldview** from the author's family about what constitutes the ""true local"" space.
  *   The author does not resist or question this logic; rather, they **present it as a formative understanding** of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author's use of the city wall as a defining boundary for local identity clearly aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — a perception passed down and socially sedimented, used to define local identity boundaries.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's statement reflects how **socially conventional mental maps**, rooted in historical and symbolic spatial divisions (like the city wall), are used to define the scope and identity of ""local people"".

肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心,"RL1, RL5"," *   The author is expressing a subjective, possibly humorous or ironic, assertion that ""Xianlin is the center of the universe"", implying that it is the most convenient or central place, possibly in contrast to other areas. The core expressive intent is to elevate Xianlin's status as the ultimate local center, possibly reflecting or exaggerating a local identity bias.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""仙林是宇宙的中心"" (""Xianlin is the center of the universe"") — This is a hyperbolic statement that implicitly defines Xianlin as the symbolic or perceptual core of the local area.
  *   ""肯定便利啊"" (""Of course it's convenient"") — This implies that convenience and functional livability are part of the author's reasoning for considering Xianlin as the center.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""仙林是宇宙的中心"" functions as a **symbolic territorial claim**, reinforcing a strong local identity centered on Xianlin. It is not literal but serves to **emotionally and cognitively elevate Xianlin** as the core local area, possibly in contrast to other parts of the city or region.
  *   The phrase ""肯定便利啊"" reinforces this by **providing a functional justification** — the author sees convenience (a RL5 feature) as a reason why Xianlin deserves to be considered the center.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — The author implicitly endorses a symbolic mental map where Xianlin is the center, which defines the local identity boundary.
  *   **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** — The author uses convenience (a functional livability feature) as a criterion to evaluate or justify Xianlin's status as the center.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author constructs a local identity framework where **Xianlin is not just a place but the symbolic and functional heart of the local world**, based on both **territorial perception** and **livability attributes**.
  *   These two RL elements work together: RL1 defines the symbolic centrality, and RL5 provides a practical justification for that centrality.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL1, RL5`"
什么时候方言成为决定是否是主城区的标准了？,N/A," The author is questioning the logic or standard by which **""dialect"" becomes a criterion for determining whether someone belongs to the ""main urban area"" (主城区)**. This implies a critique or challenge to the use of dialect as a marker of local identity or urban belonging.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key term is **""方言"" (dialect)**, which is directly mentioned as the supposed standard for judging ""main urban area"" identity. This clearly relates to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which defines local identity based on language, accent, or linguistic habits.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is **not endorsing** the use of dialect as a standard; rather, they are **questioning or resisting** it. Therefore, the RL4 element is **not something the author endorses**, but rather something they are **critical of or contrasting with their own view**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author is **not endorsing** the use of dialect as a standard for defining local identity, **RL4 is not a valid category** to annotate from the author's perspective.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  No RL category is endorsed or implied by the author in this statement. The author is **resisting** a certain logic, not proposing or implying a specific standard of their own for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 6: Output Result**
  Output:"
行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,N/A," *   The author is arguing that **administrative boundaries are not a valid or meaningful way to define ""local"" identity**. They acknowledge that栖霞 (Qixia) is officially part of the main urban area administratively, but point out that its periphery extends into句容 (Jurong), implying that such broad administrative inclusion is impractical or misleading. The final sentence — “本地人从来不看这个” — clearly conveys that **real local identity is not based on administrative definitions**, but on something else (which is not specified in this snippet, but the author clearly rejects administrative legitimacy as a defining criterion).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The phrase “行政上栖霞也是主城区” (Qixia is also part of the main urban area administratively) clearly refers to **administrative legitimacy** (RL2).
  *   The phrase “你能按行政区域划分？” (Can you divide it by administrative regions?) questions the validity of using **administrative boundaries**.
  *   The phrase “本地人从来不看这个” (Local people never look at this) implies that **administrative criteria are not endorsed by locals** — i.e., the author rejects RL2 as a valid standard for defining local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) is **explicitly referenced** but **strongly rejected** by the author as a valid way to define local identity.
  *   The author is **contrasting official administrative definitions with local people’s actual understanding or perception** of what constitutes a ""local"" area or person.
  *   The author **does not propose an alternative**, but clearly indicates that **they do not endorse administrative criteria**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although RL2 is mentioned, it is **not endorsed** — it is **explicitly negated** by the author.
  *   No other RL categories are explicitly or implicitly endorsed in this snippet.
  *   The author **does not propose a positive criterion** for defining local identity, only **rejects one (RL2)**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Since the task is to identify **criteria the author endorses**, and this text only **rejects RL2 without endorsing any**, **no RL category applies**.

南京最大的问题就是核心还在老城 而且隧道多没有走高架看起来壮观 新区一直都没有让外地人熟知 外地人过来大概率不会去江北河西之类的 除了看演唱会 不像钱江世纪城和浦东之类的被人熟知 走走江东路江北大道双龙大道也不会觉得城市界面不好 而且老城真没什么问题 除了中山北路被地铁缠的,RL1," The author is expressing a view about **how南京 (Nanjing)** is perceived by outsiders and what areas are considered its **core or representative local identity**. The central idea is that **Nanjing's ""core"" is still associated with the old city**, while the new districts (like Jiangbei or Hexi) are not well known or recognized by outsiders as representative of Nanjing. The author contrasts this with cities like Hangzhou (Qiantang Century City) and Shanghai (Pudong), where new districts are widely recognized. The author also implies that the city’s image is affected by infrastructure (e.g., tunnels vs. elevated roads) and urban aesthetics (e.g., the negative impact of the metro on Zhongshan North Road).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""核心还在老城"" → Suggests a **territorial perception** that the core identity of Nanjing lies in the old city.
  - ""新区一直都没有让外地人熟知"" → Implies a **social perception or mental map** that new districts are not seen as part of the local identity by outsiders.
  - ""外地人过来大概率不会去江北河西之类的"" → Suggests a **mental boundary or territorial perception** of what is considered ""local"" vs. not.
  - ""不像钱江世纪城和浦东之类的被人熟知"" → Implies a **comparison of territorial perception** where other cities have successfully established new core areas recognized by outsiders.
  - ""走走江东路江北大道双龙大道也不会觉得城市界面不好"" → Evaluates **urban aesthetics**, but **not directly linked to defining local identity**, so not annotated.
  - ""老城真没什么问题"" → Evaluates the old city positively, but again, **not directly linked to defining local identity** unless the implication is that the old city is the standard for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The author is constructing an argument that **Nanjing’s local identity is still centered on the old city**, not the new districts. This is based on **how outsiders perceive the city**, which the author sees as a problem.
  - The **territorial perception** of the old city as the ""core"" and the **lack of recognition of new districts** by outsiders are **central to the author’s argument**.
  - Comparisons with other cities (Hangzhou and Shanghai) reinforce the idea that **territorial identity can change**, but Nanjing hasn't achieved that yet.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that **the old city is the core of local identity**, based on **social perception and mental maps**.
  - The author implies that **territorial perception by outsiders is a valid standard** for evaluating what counts as ""local"" or not.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that **people should use socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) to define who or what counts as ""local"" in Nanjing. Specifically, the author emphasizes that the **old city is seen as the real local core**, while **new districts like Jiangbei or Hexi are not widely recognized as part of the local identity**. This reflects a **socially conventional mental map** of the city and its local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
从大胜关高铁过江这个角度可以看到河西skyline,N/A," *   The author is sharing a visual observation or appreciation of the skyline of Hexi from the perspective of the Ganshengguan high-speed rail crossing the river. There is no explicit or implicit discussion about what defines a ""local person"" or any criteria related to local identity. The statement appears to be a neutral or aesthetic observation of geography or urban landscape.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   There are no direct or indirect references to identity, belonging, social habits, administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic markers, economic status, or any other RL-related criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   There is no identifiable core argument regarding local identity. The statement is descriptive and does not aim to define or evaluate who is considered ""local"" or what constitutes a ""local"" area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Since no RL-related elements are present or implied, no criteria can be filtered.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   No RL categories can be matched, as the text does not engage with any of the RL definitions.

**Step 6: Output Result**
*   No RL categories apply.

Output:"
高楼大厦就叫城建了？交通,RL5**," The author is expressing skepticism or criticism toward a simplified or superficial understanding of what constitutes a city or urban development — specifically questioning whether the mere presence of high-rise buildings qualifies as proper urban construction (""城建""). The sentence is cut off, but the phrase ""交通"" (transportation) suggests the author may be contrasting high-rise buildings with more functional urban elements like transportation infrastructure, possibly to argue that real urban development involves more than just tall buildings.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""高楼大厦"" (high-rise buildings) — possibly linked to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), as it may reflect a standard of urban quality.
  - ""交通"" (transportation) — clearly linked to **RL5**, as it refers to urban infrastructure and functional livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **critiquing a limited or misguided standard** for evaluating urban development — equating high-rise buildings with urban construction. They imply that real urban quality or development should be measured by more meaningful criteria, such as transportation systems.
  - Therefore, both ""高楼大厦"" and ""交通"" are used to **contrast superficial versus substantive markers of urban development**, and by extension, what constitutes a ""real"" or ""quality"" local urban area.
  - The author **does not endorse the idea** that high-rise buildings alone define urban quality, but they are referencing this belief to **critique it**, showing what they **do not** consider valid for defining a ""true local urban area"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** ""高楼大厦"" as a valid standard for urban quality or local identity.
  - The author **implies endorsement** of more functional, livability-based criteria like ""交通"" (transportation) as **better indicators** of real urban development and thus, potentially, of a meaningful ""local"" urban identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is constructing a critique of shallow urban identity markers and advocating for a more functional and livability-based understanding of what makes a place ""urban"" or ""local"".
  - Therefore, **RL5** is the only valid RL category here, as the author implicitly endorses transportation infrastructure as a more legitimate standard for evaluating urban quality and, by implication, the character of a ""local"" area.

**Output: RL5**"
哈哈哈有口音哥还行,RL4," *   The author is making a light-hearted, colloquial remark about someone (""有口音哥"") who speaks with an accent, suggesting that despite the accent, the person is still acceptable or likable (""还行""). The mention of an accent implies a contrast with the local dialect or linguistic norm, and the author seems to downplay the importance of this difference.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""有口音"" — This phrase refers to someone speaking with a non-local accent, which is directly linked to **language and accent**, a core feature of **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of an accent introduces a potential boundary marker for local identity, but the author immediately softens or minimizes its importance by saying ""还行"". Rather than excluding the person based on accent, the author adopts a tolerant or inclusive stance.
  *   The author does not reject the person for lacking local linguistic traits; instead, they imply that linguistic difference (accent) is not a decisive factor in judging someone’s local status or acceptability.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The RL4 element (""有口音"") is clearly present and acknowledged by the author.
  *   However, the author does **not endorse** linguistic purity or local accent as a strict criterion for local identity; rather, they imply it is **not decisive**.
  *   Still, the fact that the author **mentions accent at all** as a notable trait suggests that **they are aware of it as a relevant factor in local identity discourse**, even if they do not strictly enforce it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text **implicitly acknowledges** the relevance of **language and accent** in defining or recognizing local identity, which corresponds to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.
  *   While the author does not strictly enforce linguistic criteria, they **recognize it as a symbolic boundary**, which is enough to qualify as an RL4 element in the context of this framework.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL4"
我基本就是在海淀朝阳丰台活动，比较宅，从我家去公司也是走四环或者三环,None," * The author is describing their **typical activity range** within Beijing, mentioning that they are ""比较宅"" (quite home-oriented), and that their commute from home to work follows the **Fourth or Third Ring Road**. This implies a **geographical pattern of movement** and a certain **familiarity or identification with these districts** (Haidian, Chaoyang, Fengtai), but there is **no explicit or implicit assertion about what defines a ""local"" person**. The text is more about personal lifestyle and movement habits than about defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mentioned districts: Haidian, Chaoyang, Fengtai — could relate to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** if used to define local identity.
  * Reference to commuting via 三环/四环 (Third/Fourth Ring Road) — could imply **familiarity with local infrastructure**, potentially linked to **RL1 or RL3**.
  * ""比较宅"" (quite home-oriented) — may hint at **lifestyle**, but not clearly linked to defining local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  * The districts and commuting routes are mentioned as **background information** about the author’s life, not to argue any definition of ""local"".
  * There is **no evaluative or definitional stance** about what makes someone ""local"" — the author is not asserting that living in these districts, knowing the ring roads, or being home-oriented makes someone more or less local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not present any criteria** for defining ""local identity"".
  * There is **no endorsement or implied standard** about what makes someone a local — the text is descriptive, not evaluative or definitional.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * None of the RL categories apply because the author does not define or evaluate ""local identity"" — the text is about **personal behavior**, not **identity construction or evaluation**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: None"
礼贤拆迁户,"RL2, RL3"," The phrase ""礼贤拆迁户"" (Lixian demolition household) refers to people who were relocated due to urban redevelopment in Lixian (礼贤镇), likely involving compensation, resettlement, or property changes. In this context, the term may be used to describe a social group defined by their connection to a specific location through residence history and administrative processes. The term may carry implications of local belonging through historical rootedness or government recognition.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""礼贤"" (Lixian) — a specific territorial identity, possibly indicating a historically recognized area or administrative unit.
  *   ""拆迁户"" (demolition household) — a group identified through administrative resettlement policy, potentially linked to household registration or property ownership in a designated area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""礼贤"" functions to situate the group within a specific local geography, potentially invoking a conventional territorial identity or boundary.
  *   ""拆迁户"" implies administrative classification, possibly used to distinguish locals from non-locals through official resettlement status or property history.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The phrase implies a distinction between those who are considered part of the local community (due to prior residence or official recognition as demolition households) and those who are not.
  *   It suggests that administrative legitimacy (RL2) and family historical rootedness (RL3) may be criteria used to define ""local people"" in this context.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** Being a ""拆迁户"" often involves official documentation and recognition, such as hukou status or property records, which are used to determine eligibility for compensation and resettlement — criteria that define local belonging.
  *   **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The demolition process usually affects long-term residents, implying that those who lived in the area for a significant time are seen as more ""local"" than newcomers.

The author is not directly defining ""local identity"" or discussing any criteria related to it. Instead, they are criticizing flawed reasoning or generalization.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  There are no references to region, identity, belonging, culture, language, family history, administrative status, occupation, or any other concept tied to defining ""local people"" or evaluating local areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The text contains no RL-related content. The analogies used (酸杏, 糊的西红柿炒鸡蛋) are about reasoning and perception, not about identity, belonging, or locality.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the text does not address ""local identity"" or any related criteria, no RL categories apply.

The core intent appears to be expressing **how they personally perceive and mentally categorize different Beijing districts**, often based on cultural, social, and spatial identity markers.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Mentions of historical names (""通县""), commonly accepted labels (""中国的秋叶原""), and symbolic associations (""美术馆"", ""大学集中营"", etc.) suggest conventionalized regional identities.
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Personal connections like ""我出生的地方"", ""我家"", ""我奶奶家"" indicate a sense of local identity rooted in **personal or family history**.
- **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Repeated mentions of ""说话带口音"" (speaking with an accent) in several districts imply **linguistic identity markers** used to distinguish locals.
- **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** Phrases like ""修电脑的"" (computer repair people), ""学霸集中营"" (nerd hub), ""大学集中营"" (university hub) associate certain **occupational or educational identities** with specific districts.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
- **RL1** functions as the **basis for mental mapping**—the author uses conventional labels and symbolic associations to define the **identity and perception** of each district.
- **RL3** functions to **anchor personal identity**—the author defines certain districts as part of their personal or family geography, indicating emotional or historical attachment.
- **RL4** functions to **differentiate locals from others**—the author uses accents as a subtle but consistent marker to distinguish local identity.
- **RL7** functions to **stereotype or characterize districts**—occupational or educational identities are used to define the **social character** of certain areas, indirectly shaping perceptions of who belongs.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
All of the above RLs are **endorsed or referenced by the author** as part of their personal understanding and description of Beijing’s districts. They are used to **construct a subjective but coherent identity map** of what different areas ""mean"" and who belongs where.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL1** is used to define how districts are **symbolically or conventionally perceived**.
- **RL3** is used to mark **personal and family rootedness** as part of local identity.
- **RL4** is used to **distinguish locals linguistically**.
- **RL7** is used to **associate certain occupations or educational identities** with specific districts, shaping their ""local"" character.

These RLs together reflect the author's **multi-layered, subjective, and culturally embedded** understanding of ""local identity"" across Beijing’s districts.

They compare Miyun unfavorably to what they consider the standard for a modern Beijing ""local"" area — where **subways are available** and daily services (like a快递驿站 - courier service station) are more accessible. The author implies that Miyun, being served only by buses and requiring long travel times for basic services, **falls short of the standard of a ""real"" or ""ideal"" local area in Beijing**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""交通就不太方便，就只有公交""** – transportation is inconvenient, only buses are available.
  - **""北京应该就有地铁""** – a place should have subways if it's really part of Beijing.
  - **""在镇上，你要去哪哪的也不方便""** – being in a ""town"" makes accessing services inconvenient.
  - **""骑一个小时的自行车才能去""** – needing to bike for an hour to access basic services.

These all relate to **functional accessibility and infrastructure**, and the author uses them to **evaluate the ""local"" quality of the area**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is constructing a **standard of what it means to be a ""real"" or ""good"" local area in Beijing**, and **Miyun fails that standard** because it lacks subway access and has poor infrastructure for daily life. These RL5-related elements are **not just complaints about inconvenience**; they are used to **define or evaluate what counts as a legitimate or ideal ""local"" area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is clearly endorsing the **presence of subway access and convenient facilities** as a **criterion for evaluating whether a place counts as a ""real"" or ""ideal"" local area** in Beijing. This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is **judging Miyun as not meeting the standard of a ""good"" or ""real"" local area in Beijing** because of its **lack of subway access and inconvenient facilities**. This is a clear example of **RL5**, where the **functional quality of the area is used as a standard to evaluate or define the ""local"" value** of a region.

These associations are not just descriptions of the districts, but reflect **symbolic meanings and mental maps** that distinguish one area from another. The descriptions imply a **cognitive and symbolic boundary** between these areas, suggesting that each has a distinct identity within the broader ""Beijing"" context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text repeatedly assigns symbolic or cultural meanings to each district (e.g., ""朝阳：潮人多 外地人也多"", ""顺义：听朋友说那边有钱人多"", ""怀柔：北京后花园"", etc.), which are not just factual observations but **socially accepted labels** that define how people perceive and categorize these areas.
  *   The text also implies **spatial differentiation** and **emotional or symbolic distance** (e.g., ""房山，昌平，大兴，通州：好远""), suggesting a **mental map** of local identity where proximity or familiarity affects perception.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The symbolic labels and perceived distance serve to **differentiate districts** in terms of identity and belonging. These are not just descriptions of facilities or demographics, but **symbolic markers** that influence how people identify with or relate to a place.
  *   The author is not endorsing one district over another in terms of quality, but rather describing how each is **symbolically categorized** in the collective consciousness, which plays a role in how people understand **local identity** within Beijing.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not using administrative boundaries, personal history, language, or economic factors to define local identity.
  *   The key criteria being used are **symbolic meanings, socially accepted labels, and mental maps** that distinguish one district from another — all of which align with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text reflects the author's **implicit acceptance** of **socially conventional territorial identities** — that is, the commonly accepted or culturally sedimented meanings assigned to different districts in Beijing, which help define **who belongs where** and **how areas are cognitively and emotionally mapped** in relation to one another.

The main intent seems to be to **evaluate the qualities of each area**, but not necessarily to define who is or isn't a ""local"" based on these qualities.
  *   The text **does not explicitly or implicitly propose a definition or boundary for ""local people""**. It simply describes differences in lifestyle and environment.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Potential RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition) elements:
      *   ""山好水好"" (beautiful mountains and water), ""生活节奏慢"" (slow pace of life), ""玩的东西少"" (few entertainment options) — describe environmental and lifestyle quality of the suburbs.
      *   ""玩的东西多"" (many entertainment options), ""生活节奏快"" (fast-paced life), ""有地铁"" (has a metro) — describe urban functional livability.
  *   No clear RL1 (Territorial Identity), RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness), RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition), RL6 (Depth of Social Roots), or RL7 (Occupational Symbolism) elements are present.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The RL5-like elements are used to **contrast lifestyle and environmental features** of two different areas.
  *   However, **these features are not used to define who is a ""local"" or to evaluate the legitimacy, authenticity, or boundaries of ""local identity""**. They are **descriptive**, not **definitional or evaluative** in terms of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does not use any of the described features to **draw boundaries**, **establish identity**, or **evaluate who is or isn't local**.
  *   The descriptions are **neutral observations** about lifestyle and facilities, **not criteria for local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Phrases like “胡同多多的，是真京爷” (lots of hutongs, they are real Beijingers) suggest that certain areas are symbolically or socially recognized as embodying the authentic local identity.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Mentions like “大一在昌平，远，好朋友在那上大学” (I was in Changping during freshman year, far, friends went to college there) or “密云：我家” (Miyun: my home) imply a personal connection or lived experience that contributes to a sense of local identity.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The repeated use of “京爷” (Jingye) in addressing people from Dongcheng and Xicheng implies a cultural or linguistic identity marker.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** Phrases like “去城里不方便” (inconvenient to go downtown), “存了半天喝不着水库水” (saved water for a long time but couldn’t drink the reservoir water) suggest that Miyun is seen as distant and lacking in urban convenience.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The mention of “国际学校多有钱人多” (many international schools, many rich people) in Shunyi hints at a social or economic hierarchy being used to define the area’s identity.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** The phrase “上大学，就认识这一亩三分地” (went to college, only knew this small area) in Chaoyang may imply that student life defines the local character of the area.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1:** Used to distinguish areas with ""authentic"" local identity (e.g., Dongcheng and Xicheng as traditional hutong areas), suggesting a conventional, territorial understanding of what constitutes a ""real local.""
  - **RL3:** Personal experiences (e.g., living in Changping, home in Miyun) are used to establish a sense of belonging or local identity.
  - **RL4:** The use of “京爷” and the contrast with other districts implies a cultural-linguistic boundary between ""true locals"" and others.
  - **RL5:** The mention of inconvenience and lack of access to city resources in Miyun reflects the author’s perception of the area’s functional limitations, which may affect how “local” or “central” it is seen.
  - **RL6:** The reference to international schools and wealthy people in Shunyi implies that economic status is a symbolic feature of that area’s identity.
  - **RL7:** The phrase about only knowing “this small area” after attending college in Chaoyang implies that the area is defined by its student population, which may symbolize its local character.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1:** The author endorses the idea that Dongcheng and Xicheng are ""real local"" areas due to their hutong culture.
  - **RL3:** The author implies that personal lived experience (e.g., having lived in Changping, having a home in Miyun) contributes to being considered local.
  - **RL4:** The author uses “京爷” to differentiate certain districts as more authentically local, implying cultural-linguistic recognition.
  - **RL5:** The author comments on Miyun’s inconvenient location and lack of access to city water, which may imply a negative evaluation of its ""local"" status in terms of livability.
  - **RL6:** The mention of wealthy people and international schools in Shunyi implies that economic status contributes to how the area is perceived.
  - **RL7:** The reference to student life in Chaoyang implies that occupation (being a student) contributes to the local identity of the area.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1:** The author associates Dongcheng and Xicheng with traditional hutong culture, implying they are more authentically local.
  - **RL3:** Personal experiences like living in Changping or having a home in Miyun are used to express a sense of local belonging.
  - **RL4:** The term “京爷” is used to distinguish certain districts as culturally and linguistically more local.
  - **RL5:** Miyun is described as inconvenient and lacking in urban resources, which affects how it is perceived in terms of local value.
  - **RL6:** Shunyi is associated with wealthy people and international schools, suggesting that economic status contributes to its local identity.
  - **RL7:** Chaoyang is associated with student life, implying that occupation contributes to the area’s local character.

These labels reflect how the author perceives or categorizes these areas and, by implication, the people living there. The labels are not random—they often reflect cultural, social, historical, or even functional characteristics that the author associates with each district.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author uses conventional, socially recognized labels for each district (e.g., ""皇城根儿"" for Xicheng, ""正黄旗"" for Dongcheng), which imply traditional or historical identity and boundaries.
  *   - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The mention of ""学生时期每周末都来补习"" (came every weekend during student years) for Haidian implies a personal history or connection, possibly indicating familiarity or rootedness.
  *   - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The phrase ""有口音"" (has an accent) for Yanqing directly references linguistic identity, which the author uses to distinguish locals from non-locals (""不算北京"" — not considered Beijing).
  *   - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author associates several districts with environmental or functional qualities like ""水库环境好"" (good reservoir environment), ""空气好"" (good air), and ""鱼好吃"" (delicious fish), which may reflect a standard of livability or local value.
  *   - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** The label ""全是学霸"" (full of top students) for Haidian implies a specific occupational or educational identity that the author associates with the area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is constructing a mental map of Beijing's districts, assigning each a symbolic identity. These identities are not just descriptive—they are evaluative and often rooted in conventional or cultural understandings of what defines a place and its people.
  *   The RL elements are **used by the author to define and distinguish ""local"" identity** for each area, based on conventional understanding, cultural-linguistic markers, historical rootedness, and functional qualities.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   All the RL elements identified above are part of the author's **own framework** for distinguishing and evaluating the ""local"" identity of each district.
  *   These are not resisted or negated; they are **explicitly used** by the author to describe and differentiate ""local"" areas and people.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **RL1** to define territorial identity and boundaries of ""local"" areas based on conventional, historical, and social understandings.
  *   **RL3** is used in relation to personal history and familiarity with a district, contributing to a sense of local identity.
  *   **RL4** is directly invoked with the mention of accent, which the author uses to exclude Yanqing from being ""Beijing.""
  *   **RL5** is used to evaluate the livability and environmental quality of certain districts, which the author links to their local value or identity.
  *   **RL7** is used to associate specific occupational or educational identities with certain districts, contributing to the author's definition of ""local"" identity.

These descriptions include judgments about housing (e.g., “老破小房价高” – old, small apartments with high prices), accessibility (“好远”), tourism (“好多宰游客的景点”), cultural or functional attributes (“全是学校,” “好玩的商场挺多”), and personal memories or associations (“小时候舞蹈考级去过,” “假期去烧烤”).  
  *   The key observation is that the author is **not directly defining who counts as a “local” person**. Instead, they are **describing the districts** in terms of **livability, accessibility, and personal experience**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   Phrases like “老破小房价高,” “全是学校,” “好玩的商场挺多,” “好远,” “好多宰游客的景点,” and “假期去烧烤” relate to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as they describe the **quality or characteristics of an area**.
  *   Phrases like “小时候舞蹈考级去过” and “假期去烧烤” imply **personal experience with the area**, but **not necessarily growing up there** or **being rooted in the area**, so they do **not** clearly align with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  *   There are **no references to administrative boundaries, hukou, dialects, cultural habits, or social networks**, so **RL2, RL4, and RL6** are **not applicable**.
  *   There is **no discussion of what makes someone “local”**—the author is not **defining local identity**, only **commenting on the districts**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **RL5 elements** are used to **describe and evaluate the districts**, not to **define local identity** or **determine who counts as local**.
  *   The **personal experiences** mentioned do not indicate **a long-term or rooted presence** in the area, so they **do not support RL3**.
  *   The author is **not asserting any criteria** for defining “local people” or evaluating the “localness” of an area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   There is **no endorsement of any criteria** for defining “local identity”.
  *   The text **does not attempt to define who is local**, nor does it **evaluate the “localness” of an area** based on any specific standard.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although the text discusses **livability and environmental quality**, it does **not use these as criteria for defining “local identity”** or evaluating the “localness” of areas.
  *   Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: None"
老师我家怀柔也想要地铁,RL5," * The author is expressing a desire for the introduction of a subway (metro) system in Huairou (a district in Beijing), likely to improve transportation convenience and connectivity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is “也想要地铁” (""also wants a subway/metro""). This implies a comparison or aspiration towards other areas that already have subways.
  * This suggests that the author sees subway access as a mark of urban development or modernity, and possibly as a criterion for being considered a ""core local"" area within the city.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The desire for a subway indicates that the author associates metro access with urban quality of life and possibly with being recognized as a ""true"" or ""developed"" local area.
  * The author may be implying that without a subway, Huairou is not fully recognized or integrated into the urban core, and thus its ""local"" status is not fully validated.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author links subway access (a functional livability factor) to the perception of being a proper or ideal local area.
  * This aligns with **RL5**, as it directly ties the presence of a metro to the evaluation of the area's ""local value"" or legitimacy.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's statement reflects the belief that having a metro is a standard by which a place is judged to be a modern, livable, and thus ""proper"" local area.
  * This supports the RL5 definition: the author is evaluating the quality and legitimacy of a ""local"" area based on its functional livability (transportation infrastructure).

**Step 6: Output Result**

These descriptions reflect how the author perceives and categorizes these areas in terms of **identity, status, and symbolic attributes**. The tone and content suggest an implicit hierarchy or differentiation among the districts, with some having notable landmarks or cultural symbols, while others are dismissed or vaguely defined.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text contains a series of short labels or symbolic associations with districts, some of which imply **territorial identity**, **cultural-linguistic recognition**, and **functional livability or environmental quality cognition**.
  *   For example:
      *   “城里人” (urbanites) for Dongcheng and Xicheng — implies **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
      *   “很那个的地方” (kind of a place) for Haidian — **vague**, not clearly RL
      *   “环球拿得出手” (Universal Studios is the highlight) for Tongzhou — implies **RL5** (Functional Livability)
      *   “牛栏山一中” (Niulanshan No.1 High School) for Shunyi — could imply **RL5**
      *   “天通苑” (Tiantongyuan), “荟聚” (Livolong), “水库” (reservoir), “冬奥” (Olympics) — imply **RL5** or **RL1**, depending on context
      *   “钢！” (steel!) for Shijingshan — could imply **RL7** (Occupational Symbolism), if linked to steel industry workers
      *   “城中村” (urban village) for Shijingshan — implies **RL1** and **RL5**
      *   “大桃” (big peaches) for Pinggu — implies **RL7** (Occupational Symbolism), if linked to local agriculture

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not explicitly defining ""local people"" but is **symbolically mapping Beijing districts**, assigning them **identity markers** and **status symbols**.
  *   These symbolic associations function as **cognitive boundaries** and **status indicators** that imply **who or what represents a ""real local"" or a ""good local area""**.
  *   The author seems to **endorse** certain districts as having **more legitimate or recognizable ""local"" identity** based on their symbolic or functional attributes.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author uses **territorial identity markers** (e.g., “城里人”), **functional attributes** (e.g., “环球拿得出手”, “荟聚”), and **occupational or economic symbols** (e.g., “钢！”, “大桃”) to **construct a symbolic ranking** of districts.
  *   These are not just descriptions but **standards of evaluation** used to differentiate and rank the districts in terms of **local identity legitimacy**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — The labels “城里人” (urbanites) for Dongcheng and Xicheng reflect **socially conventional distinctions** between urban and non-urban areas, implying **core-periphery mental maps**.
  *   **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** — Phrases like “环球拿得出手” (Universal Studios is the highlight), “荟聚” (Livolong shopping center), and “水库” (reservoir) suggest that the **functional or symbolic assets** of a place contribute to its **perceived local value or identity**.
  *   **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** — “钢！” (steel!) and “大桃” (big peaches) imply **occupational identity markers** associated with certain districts, which the author uses to **symbolically define the local character** of those areas.

RL1, RL3, RL4, RL5, RL6"," The text appears to be a list of associations the author has with various districts in Beijing, mostly referencing landmarks, notable features, or personal experiences. While there is no explicit argument or definition of ""local identity"", the author implicitly conveys a sense of familiarity or lack thereof with each area. This familiarity may reflect **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** and **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**, especially where personal experiences, accents, or local characteristics are referenced.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):**
    - Mentions of landmarks and symbolic places: 故宫 (Forbidden City), 南锣鼓巷 (Nanluoguxiang), 景山公园 (Jingshan Park), 慕田峪长城 (Mutianyu Great Wall), 周口店猿人遗址 (Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site), 八达岭长城 (Badaling Great Wall), 动物园 (Beijing Zoo), 雁栖湖 (Yanqi Lake), 南山滑雪场 (Nanshan Ski Resort), 水库 (reservoir), 桃 (peaches).
    - These imply a **symbolic or conventional understanding** of what defines the identity or character of a place.

  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):**
    - “口音好重” (heavy accent) in 平谷 (Pinggu).
    - This is a **direct linguistic marker** used to distinguish locals.

  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):**
    - “对象在内块上过学” (my partner studied there) in 门头沟 (Mentougou).
    - “学校里有个住这儿的走读生” (there was a day student who lived there) in 丰台 (Fengtai).
    - These imply **personal or relational history**, which can be linked to local identity.

  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):**
    - “别墅 有钱的多” (villas, many rich people) in 顺义 (Shunyi).
    - This implies **economic status and property ownership** as markers of local identity or area character.

  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):**
    - “去机场千万别卡点……” (don’t leave for the airport at the last minute) in 大兴 (Daxing).
    - “超级合生汇” (Super Heshenghui) in 昌平 (Changping).
    - These suggest **functional and environmental characteristics** that influence perception of a place, potentially linked to local identity.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **not making a direct argument** about who counts as a local, but rather listing **symbolic, experiential, and relational associations** with each district.
  - These associations are used to **express familiarity or distance**, and in some cases, to **imply characteristics that distinguish locals or local areas** (e.g., accent, economic status, landmarks, personal history).
  - These elements function as **implicit criteria** for identifying what makes a place feel “local” or what makes someone a local.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - All identified RL elements are **not opposed** by the author and are **used to implicitly define or evaluate local identity or local areas**.
  - They are **not just describing phenomena or preferences**, but **indicating what makes a place or person “local”** in the author’s perception.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author uses symbolic places and landmarks to define the identity and scope of each district.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Personal and relational history is used to express a sense of connection or disconnection with certain areas.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The mention of a “heavy accent” is used to distinguish locals in Pinggu.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** Functional characteristics (e.g., airport access, commercial centers) are used to evaluate the quality or distinctiveness of a local area.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The presence of rich people and villas in Shunyi implies a **symbolic economic identity** of the area.

The descriptions go beyond mere geography and imply **subjective evaluations of who belongs where**, especially through references to **residential patterns, population composition, and symbolic traits** associated with each district.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of **district names** (东直门, 雍和宫, 朝外SOHO, etc.) suggest **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — the author is mapping out which areas are associated with which symbolic identities.
  - Reference to **programmers in Haidian** and **""Jingye"" (native Beijingers) in Chaoyang** suggests **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** — certain districts are associated with specific occupational or social groups.
  - Descriptions like “外来打工人” (migrant workers), “租房子或者住员工宿舍” (renting or living in dorms), and “那边房子相对较便宜” (cheaper housing) imply **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** — linking housing patterns and economic status to local identity.
  - The repeated use of **“挺偏的”** (too remote) and **“山里”** (in the mountains) implies a **hierarchical perception of centrality and marginality**, reinforcing **RL1** — where “local” is associated with centrality and familiarity.
  - The phrase “那边的人挺横，打架不好欺负” (people there are tough, not easy to bully) implies **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** or **RL6**, as it attributes behavioral and status traits to residents of certain districts.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses these RL elements to **construct a mental map of Beijing** that reflects **who lives where and why**, based on **symbolic, economic, and social criteria**. These are not neutral observations but **normative judgments** that define who is seen as a “true” local and who is not — often by implication.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author clearly endorses a mental map of Beijing where **“central” districts like Dongcheng and Xicheng** are seen as more “authentically local” than “peripheral” ones like Mentougou or Fangshan.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author implies that **economic status and housing patterns (rental vs. ownership, dormitory vs. private residence)** are used to distinguish between locals and non-locals.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)**: The author associates **programmers in Haidian** and **""Jingye"" (native Beijingers) in Chaoyang** with certain identities, implying that **occupation or social class is a criterion for local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author uses **RL1** to establish a symbolic geography of Beijing, **RL6** to evaluate the depth of local belonging through housing and economic status, and **RL7** to associate certain districts with occupational or behavioral identities.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author uses **RL1** to construct a **mental map** of Beijing, where certain districts are perceived as more or less “local” based on geography, symbolic perception, and historical impressions.
- The author uses **RL4** to distinguish **local vs. non-local** based on accent, which is tied to identity perception.
- The author uses **RL5** to evaluate the **quality or desirability of a local area**, which indirectly shapes the **symbolic value of being “local”** to that area.
- **RL3 and RL2** are mentioned but not used as **core criteria** for defining local identity in the author’s argument.

  *   - Implicit boundary distinctions (e.g., Mentougou as ""山沟"", Fangshan as previously ""郊区"").
  *   - Functional and environmental qualities (e.g., Chaoyang ""感觉很有钱"", Fengtai as a ""家"", Haidian with many universities).
  *   - Economic or social-rootedness indicators (e.g., ""没啥好工作"", ""地铁好多人"", ""父母鸡娃"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - The **historical and symbolic meanings** (e.g., Chongwen and Xuanwu being merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively) are used to **anchor the identity of these districts within the broader mental map of Beijing**, reinforcing a **socially conventional understanding of local identity**.
  *   - The **mention of accents in Pinggu** subtly implies a **cultural-linguistic boundary** between locals and others, but it is not central to the argument.
  *   - The **economic and functional descriptions** (e.g., Chaoyang being ""很有钱"", Fengtai having ""no good jobs"") are more about **quality of life or economic observation** than defining ""local"" identity.
  *   - The **descriptions of suburban vs. urban origins** (e.g., Fengtai being ""以前是郊区"") reflect **territorial identity shifts**, which support RL1.
  *   - The **mention of jobs and crowded subways** is more about **urban experience and livability**, not about defining ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - The **core argument** is about how different districts are **socially and historically perceived** in the collective consciousness of Beijing residents.
  *   - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **districts have symbolic and historical identities** that contribute to a **mental map of localness**, especially through **historical mergers and regional labels**.
  *   - Other RL elements (like economic status, cultural-linguistic traits, or functional livability) are **mentioned but not used to define or evaluate ""local"" identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly present: the author uses **historical labels, symbolic associations, and regional stereotypes** to define how different districts are perceived in terms of **local identity and territorial boundaries**.
  *   - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is **minimally present** (e.g., ""有地方口音"" in Pinggu), but it's not central or emphasized as a **core identity marker** by the author.
  *   - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** and **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** are **mentioned as observations**, but not used as **identity-defining criteria**.

The author supplements this with historical administrative changes in Beijing's districts, indicating that the concept of ""local"" (i.e., the core city) has evolved over time due to administrative boundary changes. The core expressive intent is to illustrate how **certain areas are socially and historically perceived as the ""real"" local core**, and how **administrative changes have altered perceptions of local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The elderly person's distinction between ""城里"" (the city center) and areas like Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, and Shijingshan as ""近郊"" (near suburbs) — potentially **RL1**.
  - The mention of historical administrative changes (e.g., merging of districts, incorporation of Changping, Tongzhou, etc.) — potentially **RL2**.
  - The author's own verification and elaboration of historical boundary changes — reinforcing **RL2** and possibly **RL1**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author presents the elderly person’s perception that only certain traditional districts (e.g., Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chongwen, Xuwen) are considered the ""real"" Beijing (""城里""), while others are peripheral. This reflects a socially conventional and emotionally rooted understanding of local identity and space.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author confirms and elaborates on how administrative changes (e.g., merging districts, incorporating Changping and other areas into Beijing) have changed the official boundaries of ""Beijing."" This shows that the author is aware of how **administrative legitimacy** has shaped the evolving definition of what counts as ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not oppose** either the socially conventional understanding or the administrative changes — instead, they **present both as valid and informative perspectives**.
  - Both RL1 and RL2 are used to **illustrate how the concept of 'local' in Beijing has changed over time**, and how **different logics (social perception and administrative action)** contribute to that definition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is used to show that **socially accepted mental maps** and **historical labels** (e.g., ""城里"") are criteria for defining ""local"" identity and space.
  - **RL2** is used to show that **administrative changes** (e.g., district mergers, incorporation of new areas) are also criteria for defining what counts as part of the ""local"" territory and who is considered a local.

RL2"," The author is strongly asserting that ""local identity"" in Beijing, particularly regarding areas like延庆 (Yanqing) and 房山 (Fangshan), should be based on **historical administrative affiliation** and that **Yanqing is not originally part of Beijing**, thus its residents are not ""true locals"" in the same sense as those from areas historically belonging to Beijing.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * Mentions of **县志** (local gazetteers) → RL2
  * Emphasis on **行政归属** (administrative affiliation/history) → RL2
  * Use of **划进/划出** (incorporation into/out of Beijing) → RL2
  * Mention of **河北** (Hebei province) and temporary administration → RL2
  * Implied contrast between **original locals** and those from areas later incorporated → RL2

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses **historical administrative boundaries and changes** (RL2) to argue that **only people from areas that have historically belonged to Beijing are ""true locals""**.
  * The author **explicitly rejects** the idea that current geographic or linguistic proximity alone defines local identity.
  * The **local gazetteers** are cited as **authoritative historical records** supporting the author's view on administrative legitimacy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **explicitly endorses** the **historical administrative boundary logic** to define who is a ""true local"".
  * The **use of local gazetteers** and **administrative history** are central to the argument.
  * The **linguistic differences (e.g., Yanqing accent)** are mentioned but **not used as a core criterion** for defining local identity — rather, they are treated as a **consequence** of administrative history.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- RL1 elements are used to **construct and affirm a comprehensive, inclusive, and updated spatial identity of Beijing**, rejecting outdated or elitist views that only inner-city areas are ""real"" Beijing.
- RL5 (""六环建设也不差"") is used to **support the argument that outer areas are developed and therefore should not be excluded from local identity**. It is not just a neutral observation but a **functional component of the author's argument** for territorial legitimacy.

82年生人，小时候东西城是北京城，崇文宣武是城里破落户，朝海丰是近郊，其他都是远郊县城，二环是城乡分界线，三环就是荒地了。,RL1," The author is expressing a **subjective, historically rooted mental map** of Beijing’s urban and suburban divisions from their childhood experience. They are describing a **socially conventional understanding of which areas were considered ""core city"", ""marginal city"", ""near suburb"", and ""far suburb""**, based on a long-standing social perception that shaped the identity and boundary cognition of ""local Beijing"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""小时候东西城是北京城"" → suggests **RL1** and **RL3** (childhood experience and mental geography)
  - ""崇文宣武是城里破落户"" → suggests **RL1** (mental map with symbolic meanings)
  - ""朝海丰是近郊"" → suggests **RL1** (regional categorization)
  - ""其他都是远郊县城"" → suggests **RL1** (mental boundary-making)
  - ""二环是城乡分界线，三环就是荒地了"" → suggests **RL1** (symbolic boundary and historical perception)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  All of the above elements are used to **construct a historically sedimented, socially conventional understanding of Beijing’s urban identity and spatial hierarchy**, based on the speaker’s childhood experience. These are **not administrative definitions**, nor are they about language, culture, or economic status. Rather, they reflect **a conventionalized mental geography** that once defined who was “local” and where the “real Beijing” began and ended.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is not resisting or critiquing this mental map—they are **endorsing it as a lived reality of their childhood** and implying its continued relevance in defining local identity. Therefore, the **RL1** category is clearly endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The text reflects **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, where the author presents a **historically sedimented, socially accepted mental map** of Beijing that defines which areas are considered “real city”, “marginal”, or “suburban”, and uses these to imply a **cognitive boundary system** for identifying local identity.

对 小时候管去东西城天安门叫进北京城，出去了就都叫郊区，这么一看北京发展还是挺快的，怪不得国外都以为中国还是农村,RL1," *   The author is reflecting on how the perception of Beijing has evolved over time — specifically, how what used to be considered the core of Beijing (e.g., Dongcheng, Xicheng, and Tiananmen) has expanded in people's minds due to rapid urban development. The author implies that this expansion has been so significant that outsiders (e.g., foreigners) still perceive China as rural, possibly because they are unaware of Beijing's transformation.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The phrase “小时候管去东西城天安门叫进北京城，出去了就都叫郊区” suggests a historically conventional understanding of Beijing’s territorial boundaries — where the central districts (东西城天安men) were once seen as the real ""Beijing,"" and areas beyond were considered ""suburbs.""
  *   The author contrasts this past perception with the present, indicating a change in how ""Beijing"" is socially defined or recognized.
  *   The mention of “国外都以为中国还是农村” implies that outsiders (non-locals or foreigners) have a different or outdated perception of what constitutes a ""local"" urban area in China.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not defining who is a ""local person"" based on administrative boundaries, cultural habits, or economic status, but rather showing how **socially conventional understandings of ""the city""** have changed due to development.
  *   The key RL element here is the **historical, socially conventional perception of which areas were considered the core of Beijing** — this perception has evolved, and the author is noting that contrast.
  *   The author is not endorsing a new criterion for defining local identity but is **highlighting a shift in the socially conventional understanding** of what counts as ""Beijing"" or ""urban China.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not using administrative boundaries (RL2), family history (RL3), cultural-linguistic traits (RL4), economic status (RL6), or occupational symbolism (RL7) to define local identity.
  *   The author is not directly evaluating livability or environmental quality (RL5) as a standard for defining local areas.
  *   However, the author **does refer to a historically conventional perception of territorial identity** — that is, a socially accepted understanding of which areas were considered ""central"" vs. ""suburban"" — and contrasts it with the current, expanded perception.
  *   This implies that the **socially conventional mental map of Beijing** has shifted, and this is used by the author to illustrate how fast Beijing has developed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The key RL category here is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the author is referring to a **historically rooted, socially accepted understanding of which areas count as ""Beijing""** and how that understanding has changed over time.
  *   The author uses this to highlight the **symbolic change in how the city is perceived**, both internally and externally.

门头沟挺好的本地人占大部份 生活挺惬意 环境好人也不多 就是逛街啥的不太行小时候总觉得城里方便 年纪越大越不爱回东边了,RL1," The author is expressing a positive sentiment toward living in Mentougou, highlighting that it is predominantly inhabited by locals, is comfortable to live in, has a good environment, and is not crowded. However, they note that it lacks in terms of shopping and entertainment facilities. They also reflect on a personal shift in preference: as a child, they found the city more convenient, but as they've aged, they've grown to prefer Mentougou over the eastern part of the city (which likely refers to more central or traditionally urban areas).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""本地人占大部份"" (mostly local people) – suggests a **RL1** or **RL3** element, possibly implying a sense of rootedness or demographic identity.
- ""生活挺惬意，环境好人也不多"" (comfortable lifestyle, good environment, not crowded) – this could be **RL5**, but only if the author uses it to evaluate the area's local value.
- ""就是逛街啥的不太行"" (not great for shopping) – implies a functional limitation, possibly **RL5**, but **not used to define local identity**, so may be irrelevant.
- ""小时候总觉得城里方便"" (as a child, the city felt more convenient) – suggests a contrast in lifestyle, possibly **RL5** or **RL1**, depending on how it's used.
- ""年纪越大越不爱回东边了"" (the older I get, the less I want to go back to the east) – implies a **territorial identity shift**, possibly **RL1**, especially if the author is defining what counts as ""local"" or desirable local space.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The phrase “本地人占大部份” is central to the author’s perception of Mentougou as a place where locals live — it's not just a description, but a **value judgment** that contributes to the area’s local identity.
- The mention of lifestyle and environment (“生活挺惬意，环境好人也不多”) is not used to define who is local, but rather to **evaluate the area’s quality of life** — so **not directly tied to defining local identity**.
- The critique of shopping facilities (“逛街啥的不太行”) is a **functional limitation**, but not used to define local identity.
- The reflection on childhood perception and growing preference for Mentougou shows a **shift in territorial perception**, implying that the author now sees Mentougou as more aligned with their local identity — this is a **RL1** function.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author endorses the idea that Mentougou is predominantly inhabited by locals, and this is a **positive feature**, implying that this area **counts as a core local space** — **RL1**.
- The author also implies a **territorial re-evaluation** — moving away from traditional urban centers (the ""east"") and seeing Mentougou as a more legitimate or desirable local space — this also supports **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author’s argument revolves around **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as they describe Mentougou as a space where locals predominantly live and where they personally feel more connected. This implies a **redefinition or reassertion of what counts as “local” space**, moving away from traditional urban centers.
- There are **hints of RL5**, but these are used to evaluate the area’s livability, not to define local identity.
- There are **no clear indicators** of administrative boundaries, family history, language, occupation, or deep-rooted social or economic ties — so **RL2, RL3, RL4, RL6, and RL7 are not applicable**.

They argue that ""Beijing"" is not just any part of the current administrative area but refers more specifically to the urban core — the historically recognized ""Beijing City."" The author implies that this understanding is based on traditional mental maps and linguistic habits, not administrative changes or personal preferences.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author refers to historical continuity (""多少年就是京兆地区，天子脚下"") — potentially RL1.
  - The author distinguishes between ""Beijing"" and areas like ""密云"" based on traditional naming and conceptualization — RL1.
  - The author emphasizes how the local language system differentiates between places (""去北京城"" vs. ""去密云城"") — potentially RL4.
  - The author dismisses administrative boundary changes (""从河北划进来"") as not defining the real sense of ""Beijing"" — indicating resistance to RL2.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The historical and linguistic distinctions are central to the author’s argument — they are used to assert that ""local identity"" or at least the conceptual core of ""Beijing"" is based on long-standing cultural and spatial understandings, not administrative expansions.
  - The mention of the language system supports the idea that locals have an ingrained way of distinguishing between ""core"" and ""peripheral"" areas.
  - The dismissal of administrative changes shows the author does not accept RL2 as a valid standard for defining ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL1**, using historical, cultural, and spatial conventions to define what counts as ""Beijing"" and by extension, who might be considered a local.
  - The author **hints at RL4**, indicating that local language usage reinforces this spatial and identity distinction.
  - The author **resists RL2**, so it should not be annotated.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is strongly endorsed: The author uses historical continuity (""京兆地区"", ""天子脚下""), traditional spatial concepts (""城""), and local mental maps to define what counts as the ""real"" Beijing and by implication, who counts as a local.
  - **RL4** is weakly implied: The author uses linguistic habits (""去北京城"" sounding ""别扭"") to support the idea that people have an ingrained sense of spatial identity.

房山柿子不行，房山最大的特产是跨区打工人,RL7," *   The author is making a humorous or ironic assertion that房山 (Fangshan) is not primarily known for its traditional local products like persimmons, but rather for its large number of **cross-district migrant workers**—implying that the area is associated with people who commute to other districts for work, possibly not native or deeply rooted residents.
  *   The author is **redefining or mocking the idea of ""local identity""** by pointing out that the area's most notable feature is not a traditional cultural or territorial symbol, but rather a **demographic or occupational characteristic**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""房山柿子不行"" — This negates a traditional cultural-product association (could relate to **RL4** or **RL1**), but the author is not endorsing this as a criterion.
  *   ""房山最大的特产是跨区打工人"" — This is the core assertion: the most notable feature of Fangshan is its **migrant workers who commute across districts**. This strongly implies a contrast between traditional ""local"" identity and the current reality of the population being **mobile, possibly non-native, and occupationally defined**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   The phrase ""跨区打工人"" (cross-district workers) functions as a **contrastive identity marker** — the author is using it to **redefine or question** what it means to be ""local"" in this area.
  *   The author is **not endorsing traditional RL1, RL3, or RL4** markers of local identity (e.g., local produce, dialect, rootedness), but instead is highlighting a **new, perhaps ironic, occupational and mobility-based identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not explicitly endorsing** traditional markers of local identity.
  *   The author is **implicitly endorsing** an **occupational and mobility-based** identity — that the area is defined not by its rooted locals but by its commuter population.
  *   This aligns with **RL7: Occupational Symbolism**, as the author strongly links a specific occupational group (cross-district workers) with the identity of the area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is using **RL7** to redefine or critique the local identity of Fangshan. The implication is that the area no longer fits traditional notions of local rootedness or cultural distinctiveness, but is instead characterized by its **occupational demographic** — specifically, a large number of people who work outside the district and may not have deep local ties.

  *   These are **not used to define who is a ""local""**, nor are they used to **evaluate the local identity or boundary** of the area.
  *   The author is **not asserting or endorsing a standard for defining local people**, but rather **describing the practical implications of living in a certain area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although RL5 elements are present, they are **not used to define ""local identity""** or to **evaluate who counts as local**.
  *   The author is **not constructing a logic or standard for local identity**, but rather **expressing observations about livability and convenience**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   No RL category applies because the text **does not involve the author's endorsed logic for defining ""local identity""**.
  *   The author is **not making an argument about who counts as local or what makes someone local**—they are simply **describing the characteristics of their residential area** and comparing it with others.

Output:"
你公公纯老北京的话他们的意识里二环内才是北京三环就是郊区了,RL1," The author is conveying a perspective that ""pure old Beijing people"" (老北京) mentally regard the area **within the Second Ring Road** as the **true Beijing**, while the **Third Ring Road and beyond are considered suburban**. This reflects a **symbolic mental map** and **socially conventional territorial identity** that defines who is considered ""local"" and what areas are seen as ""central"" or ""authentic"" to local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The key idea is that **""二环内"" (within the Second Ring Road)** is considered the **core of Beijing**, and **""三环"" (Third Ring Road)** is already seen as **peripheral or suburban**.
  - This is not based on administrative boundaries or functional infrastructure but on **social perception and historical sentiment**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not describing their own identity, but rather the **identity framework of ""pure old Beijing people""**, which is being endorsed or at least accepted as a legitimate way of defining local identity.
  - The use of ""意识里"" (in their consciousness) implies that this is a **shared symbolic understanding**, not a legal or functional one.
  - The territorial division is based on **historical and social habit**, not administrative or economic criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly accepts that there is a **socially conventional mental map** that distinguishes between ""real Beijing"" and ""suburban Beijing"".
  - This aligns with the **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** category, which deals with **identity affiliation and boundary cognition based on social habits and historical sediment**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is presenting a **symbolic boundary** that defines local identity, rooted in **historical perception and social convention**, not administrative or functional criteria.
  - This supports the **RL1** category, as it reflects a **mentally mapped, socially accepted boundary** that determines who and what areas are considered ""local"".

在北京待了5，6年吧，其实一开始并不喜欢北京，到后来慢慢习惯这里，再到现在喜欢这里，举个最新鲜的例子，我爸前几天来北京玩儿住了一个多星期，他是脑梗偏瘫，二级残疾，右手右胳膊动不了，可以走路，但行动不便，右腿拐着的，每次带他出去说实话我都提心掉胆尤其上地铁（贫困家庭出行真没法次次打车，而且北京真的很堵，晕车也很难受）让我感受最深的是主动让座的都是北京大爷大妈（年轻人似乎就只有一次让座难道真的是因为上班族怨气太重了吗）而且是我爸一上车他们就看出来有问题，立马让他去座那种，我真的，心里真的万分感激，嘴里也不停的在说谢谢,"RL1, RL4"," *   The author shares a personal experience of living in Beijing for 5–6 years and how their perception of the city evolved over time. The author emphasizes a recent emotional moment involving their disabled father traveling in Beijing, where local elderly residents (Beijing大爷大妈) showed exceptional care by proactively offering seats on the subway. This experience seems to reinforce the author's growing emotional attachment to Beijing and its people, subtly shaping their perception of who counts as a ""local"" — not just by residence or time lived, but through behavior and values.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""在北京待了5，6年吧"" → potentially related to **RL3** (duration of residence).
  *   - ""再到现在喜欢这里"" → emotional connection, possibly linked to **RL1** (territorial identity with emotional basis).
  *   - ""主动让座的都是北京大爷大妈"" → behavioral and cultural norm, possibly linked to **RL4** (cultural-linguistic recognition through local behavior).
  *   - Implicit contrast between ""Beijing大爷大妈"" and ""年轻人"" → possibly **RL4** again, in terms of local behavioral expectations.
  *   - Emotional transformation from outsider to appreciator → possibly **RL1** or **RL3**, but more importantly, it frames the narrative around what makes someone ""local"" — not just time or birth, but shared values and emotional resonance.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author has lived in Beijing for 5–6 years, which might be used to argue for their own ""local"" status. However, the author does not explicitly claim to be a ""local"" based on this, nor do they suggest that 5–6 years is a criterion for being local. The duration is more of a background fact rather than a defining standard.
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author expresses growing emotional attachment to Beijing, indicating a psychological shift from outsider to someone who identifies with the city. This implies that **local identity is not just about birth or residence, but about emotional integration and perception**, which aligns with the concept of socially conventional territorial identity.
  *   - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author highlights the behavior of ""北京大爷大妈"" (Beijing’s elderly residents) — their proactive kindness and sensitivity to someone in need — as a defining feature of what makes someone ""local"". This suggests that **local identity is tied not just to place or time, but to shared cultural values and behavior**, which is a core aspect of RL4.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not** use **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, **RL5 (Functional Livability)**, **RL6 (Social Roots & Economic Status)**, or **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism)** as criteria to define ""local identity"".
  *   The author **does** suggest that **emotional integration with the city (RL1)** and **shared behavioral norms/values (RL4)** are key to being considered part of the ""local"" community.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - **RL1:** The author transitions from disliking Beijing to loving it, indicating that **local identity can be constructed through psychological integration**, not just physical presence or birth.
  *   - **RL4:** The author emphasizes the **behavior of Beijing’s elderly residents (Beijing大爷大妈)** — their kindness and attentiveness — as a **cultural marker of being ""local""**, not necessarily tied to language or accent but to shared values and social behavior.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: `RL1, RL4`"
北京地铁对坐轮椅的、盲人全程服务特别好,N/A," The author is expressing appreciation for the high-quality service provided to wheelchair users and the blind on Beijing's subway system. However, there is **no explicit or implicit endorsement of criteria used to define ""local identity""** or to evaluate the scope or quality of a ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The sentence mentions ""Beijing subway"" and discusses service quality for specific groups (wheelchair users, blind individuals), but it does **not** associate these with any criteria for defining who is a ""local"" person or evaluating the localness of an area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  None of the elements in the sentence are used to construct or support any argument about ""local identity."" The focus is on accessibility and service quality, not on defining or evaluating ""local"" identity or regions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Since the author is not making any argument about what defines a ""local person"" or what makes an area more or less ""local,"" **no RL criteria are applicable**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  No RL category applies to this text.

RL1, RL3, RL5"," The author is sharing a personal transformation in their perception of two areas — initially favoring the modern, perhaps more career-oriented朝阳 (Chaoyang), but later appreciating the livability and convenience of their childhood neighborhood in 西城 (Xicheng). They are making a **value judgment about which area qualifies as a better ""local"" living space**, based on lifestyle and environmental quality.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""大学毕业后一直在朝阳工作"" – Career/livelihood tied to Chaoyang (suggests RL7, but not directly used to define ""local identity"").
  - ""嫌弃小时候长大的西城‘无聊’"" – Implies a past perception not aligned with current values.
  - ""有孩子了回到西城"" – Return to childhood area (RL3, rootedness).
  - ""自行车去北海公园"" – Livability and accessibility (RL5).
  - ""看病走路就到"" – Proximity to public services (RL5).
  - ""小院里晒个被子"" – Lifestyle and cultural habits (RL4).
  - ""汽车也不用开了，堵车交通管制和我也没关系了"" – Avoiding congestion and inconvenience (RL5).
  - ""幸福指数直线上升"" – Evaluation of quality of life (RL5).
  - ""周末都不‘出城’去朝阳了"" – Implicit boundary between areas (RL1).
  - ""纳闷自己怎么能忍受那么些年朝阳的堵和躁"" – Critique of another area's livability (RL5).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is **constructing an argument that Xicheng is a better ""local"" living area** than Chaoyang, based on livability, personal rootedness, and lifestyle.
  - The **RL3 element** (returning to childhood area) plays a role in reinforcing emotional and historical ties.
  - The **RL5 elements** (accessibility, convenience, low stress) are central to the author's evaluation of what makes a place a good ""local"" area.
  - The **RL1 element** (not going out of the city/area) supports a mental map or boundary of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3** is endorsed as part of the author’s personal return and comfort.
  - **RL5** is the most strongly endorsed, used to **evaluate the quality of a ""local"" area**.
  - **RL1** is implicitly endorsed through the author’s choice to stay within the area and avoid others.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines a ""better local"" area based on **RL5 (functional livability)**, such as convenience, accessibility, and lifestyle.
  - They also imply a **mental boundary (RL1)** between Xicheng and Chaoyang, treating them as distinct ""local"" regions.
  - Their return to a childhood area (RL3) reinforces their sense of rootedness and comfort in defining where they belong.

西村，44公里？？？？我只是看了地铁时长,RL5**," *   The author is reacting to a statement that describes a location (possibly a neighborhood or district) as being ""44 kilometers"" away from a certain point, likely suggesting it's far or inconvenient. The author counters this by focusing on **subway travel time** (""地铁时长"") as a more relevant or acceptable measure of distance. This implies a belief that accessibility via public transportation (specifically the metro) is a key factor in evaluating whether a place can still be considered part of the ""local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key idea in the text is that **distance should be judged by metro travel time**, not raw geographical distance. This implies a **functional definition of local space** based on **urban mobility and accessibility**, which relates to how livable or connected an area is.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is **challenging a conventional understanding of distance** (44 km = far) and **replacing it with a functional one** (if the metro gets you there quickly, it's not far). This implies that the **metro system defines the effective boundaries of the ""local"" space** — places reachable within a reasonable time via metro are functionally part of the local area.
  *   The author **endorses** this standard as a **more meaningful way to judge whether a place belongs to the ""local"" urban fabric**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not** discussing:
      - Cultural or linguistic identity (RL4)
      - Family history or birthplace (RL3)
      - Administrative boundaries or hukou (RL2)
      - Social roots, property ownership, or community dividends (RL6)
      - Occupational identity (RL7)
  *   The author **is** clearly advocating for a **functional understanding of ""local"" based on transportation access**, which is a **component of urban livability and spatial perception**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **functional mobility (metro travel time)** as a **criterion for evaluating whether a place can be considered ""local"" or not**, which directly aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.
  *   The author is **not** merely describing a preference or a convenience — they are **redefining the boundary of ""local"" space** based on this functional standard.

我是外地来的牛马感觉都一样，反正天天住城中村挤地铁天天上班挨叼,"RL2, RL3, RL6"," * The author expresses a sense of alienation and frustration as a migrant worker (""外地来的牛马"") living in the city. They describe a life of hardship—living in a village-in-the-city (""城中村""), commuting via crowded subways (""挤地铁""), and enduring stressful, likely exploitative working conditions (""上班挨叼"").
  * While the author does not directly define who is or isn't a ""local"", they **contrast their own status as an outsider** with an implied ""local"" standard—suggesting that their current life contrasts with what a ""local"" life might be.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * **""外地来的"" (from out-of-town):** Suggests a **non-local identity** based on **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and/or **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**.
  * **""城中村"" (village-in-the-city):** Often associated with **migrant populations**, and may imply **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)** due to its association with marginal housing and lack of integration into the core city.
  * **""挤地铁"" (crowded subway):** May imply **functional urban experience**, but unless explicitly tied to defining ""local"", it’s **not directly RL5**.
  * **""天天上班挨叼"" (enduring daily workplace stress):** Reflects socioeconomic status, but not clearly tied to local identity unless the author implies that locals don’t face such issues.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase **""外地来的""** functions as a **self-labeling** mechanism, distinguishing the author from locals. This implies that **administrative origin or birthplace is a relevant criterion for local identity**, even if the author critiques the system.
  * The **""城中村""** lifestyle implies a **lack of deep social or economic integration**, suggesting that **economic and social rootedness** (RL6) is **not present**, and thus the author does not feel like a true ""local"".
  * There is **no clear endorsement** of RL5 (livability), RL4 (language), or RL7 (occupation) as identity markers in this text.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author does not **endorse** any criteria for defining locals, but they **implicitly accept** that certain criteria (such as **origin** and **lack of social rootedness**) are **used to distinguish locals from outsiders**.
  * Therefore, the criteria **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** are **implicitly accepted** by the author as relevant to local identity.
  * **RL6** is also relevant in that the author’s **lack of integration or rootedness** in the city implies a contrast with what might constitute a ""true local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author uses **""外地来的""** to **self-identify as non-local**, implying that **origin or family history (RL3)** and **administrative identity (RL2)** are criteria they believe are used to define locals.
  * Their **lifestyle in the城中村** and **lack of stable, integrated urban life** imply that **social and economic rootedness (RL6)** is also a **criterion for authentic local identity**, even if the author feels excluded from it.

最大的区别就是西边景色好，空气好，有山有水，不闹腾，宜居。东边各种污染严重，交通拥堵，不宜居。,RL5," The author is comparing two areas — the west and the east — primarily based on **environmental and livability factors**. They express a clear **preference for the west** due to its better scenery, cleaner air, natural features (mountains and water), peacefulness, and overall **higher quality of living**. Conversely, they criticize the east for pollution, traffic congestion, and being less livable.

This evaluative comparison implies a **value judgment** about what constitutes a ""good"" or ""ideal"" local area, based on **environmental and functional livability**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""西边景色好，空气好，有山有水，不闹腾，宜居"" — Positive description of the west in terms of **natural environment**, **air quality**, **scenery**, and **livability**.
  - ""东边各种污染严重，交通拥堵，不宜居"" — Negative description of the east in terms of **pollution**, **traffic**, and **lack of livability**.

These elements relate to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses these descriptions not just to evaluate the quality of life in two areas, but to **draw a distinction between what kind of place is considered a desirable or ideal ""local"" area**. The implication is that the **west is a better ""local"" area** because of its environmental and livability qualities, while the east falls short of this ideal.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **explicitly endorses** environmental and functional livability as **valid criteria for evaluating the quality or desirability of a local area**, and implicitly suggests that such qualities are **important markers of a ""good"" local place**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The criteria used — such as **air quality, natural scenery, traffic conditions, and overall livability** — are directly linked to **RL5**, which defines or evaluates a region's ""local"" value based on **functional livability and environmental quality**.

They imply a sense of local familiarity and change over time, particularly in terms of commercial branding and urban development, suggesting that the northern area feels ""older"" and less aligned with their own local experience.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""从小在东边"" → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - ""真的很少去西边，对那头特别不熟悉"" → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - ""明显感觉比东边老派"" → RL1 (implies a mental map or perception of regional character differences)
  - ""仙踪林"" + ""二十年没见过了"" + ""老城区中心位置开过"" → RL1 (evokes historical, emotionally rooted spatial identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Growth History):** The author uses their upbringing in the eastern part of the city as a basis for their sense of local familiarity and legitimacy, positioning themselves as an ""insider"" to the east.
  - **RL1 (Territorial Identity & Mental Maps):** The author contrasts different parts of the city based on emotional and experiential familiarity, implying that the west and north feel less ""local"" or ""current"" compared to the east. The mention of a long-disappeared chain store in the old city center reinforces a sense of historical and emotional rootedness in a specific part of the city.
  - The **description of the northern area as ""older""** and the presence of a nostalgic brand is not just a value judgment on urban development (which would fall under RL5), but is used to **construct a regional identity contrast**—a sense of ""this is not where I come from"" or ""this is not the modern local core""—which aligns with RL1.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL3 is clearly endorsed by the author as a personal basis for local identity (grew up in the east).
  - RL1 is used by the author to construct a contrast between different parts of the city and to define what feels familiar/local versus unfamiliar/non-local, based on **socially conventional, emotionally rooted, and historically sedimented** understandings of place.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines their own sense of local identity through **where they grew up (RL3)** and **how they perceive and contrast different areas of the city (RL1)**.
  - The nostalgic brand and the sense of regional unfamiliarity are not just observations about urban change (RL5), but are used to **symbolize and reinforce a deeper sense of local belonging and territorial identity (RL1)**.

开车都要这么久……那要是坐地铁不更远……是不是经常在市区上班的住在延庆都不方便啊，以后也发展不起来了吗,RL5**," The author is expressing concern or skepticism about the **functional livability** of延庆 (Yanqing, a suburban or outlying district), particularly in relation to **commute times and accessibility** for those who work in the city center. The author seems to imply that because of the long driving time and presumably even longer subway commute, living in Yanqing may not be convenient for city workers and may hinder its development.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “开车都要这么久” (“driving already takes so long”) – indicates inconvenience in transportation.
  - “坐地铁不更远” (“taking the subway wouldn’t be even farther”) – implies poor public transport connectivity.
  - “市区上班” (“working in the city center”) – highlights the functional relationship between residential area and workplace.
  - “不方便” (“inconvenient”) – evaluates the livability of the area.
  - “发展不起来” (“won’t develop”) – implies judgment on the area’s future potential based on current accessibility and convenience.

These all relate to the **evaluation of an area’s livability and development potential**, which is a core feature of **RL5**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  These elements collectively support the author’s **negative evaluation of Yanqing as a residential area for locals**, especially those working in the city center. The author uses **transportation convenience and accessibility** as a **standard to judge whether Yanqing can be considered a viable or high-quality local residential area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly uses **transportation convenience and functional accessibility** (as components of functional livability) as **standards to evaluate whether Yanqing can be considered a good local residential area**. This aligns with **RL5**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is not defining ""local"" based on cultural, administrative, or familial criteria, but rather evaluating whether a place qualifies as a **""local"" residential area** based on **transportation and livability standards**. The logic is that **a good ""local"" area should be convenient and functionally livable**, especially for those working in the city. Yanqing, according to the author, fails this standard.

**Output: RL5**"
延庆没有地铁只有长途公交，坐车的话3h打底了。在市区工作一定不要住延庆啊,RL5," *   The author is strongly advising against living in Yanqing for someone who works in the city center, citing inconvenient transportation (no metro, only long-distance buses, at least 3 hours commute). The underlying argument is that Yanqing is **not functionally livable** as a residential area for city workers and therefore **does not meet the standard of a ""local"" residential area** tied to the city center.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""没有地铁"" (no metro)
  *   ""只有长途公交"" (only long-distance buses)
  *   ""坐车的话3h打底了"" (commute takes at least 3 hours)
  *   ""在市区工作一定不要住延庆啊"" (if working in the city, definitely don’t live in Yanqing)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The transportation limitations and long commute times are **not just descriptions of Yanqing's infrastructure**, but are used as **criteria for evaluating whether Yanqing can be considered a legitimate or desirable ""local"" residential area** for city workers. The author implies that due to these RL5 (functional livability) deficiencies, Yanqing should not be considered part of the ""local"" residential space for central city dwellers.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly uses **functional livability** (transportation access and commute time) as a **key standard to judge the suitability of Yanqing as a ""local"" residential area**, and thus **RL5 is endorsed**.
  *   No other RL categories are referenced or implied in the text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, as they are evaluating Yanqing’s suitability as a ""local"" residential area based on its transportation infrastructure and commute time — key aspects of functional livability.
  *   The phrase “在市区工作一定不要住延庆啊” clearly links Yanqing’s lack of metro access and long commute times to its **unsuitability as a local residential area**, thus fitting the RL5 definition.

住在朝阳，社会关系大多在翠微周边，西边的确有点土，但那是低调，不低调也不敢啊！朝阳洋气不老少，但民营经济主导，总被西边看不起，这世界总会有你看不上我，我看不上你的事儿！,"RL1, RL6"," The author is expressing a sense of **identity-based evaluation between regions**, particularly contrasting **""Chaoyang"" and ""Cuiwei周边 (surrounding Cuiwei)""**, and implicitly defining what makes one area more **""authentically local"" or socially legitimate**. There is a strong emphasis on **social hierarchy between regions**, with **Chaoyang being economically dynamic but socially looked down upon**, and the **western area (Cuiwei area) being socially rooted and thus more respected**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “住在朝阳” (living in Chaoyang) → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, because it implies a self-identification with Chaoyang.
  - “社会关系大多在翠微周边” (social connections mostly around Cuiwei) → **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**, as it emphasizes social networks as a basis for legitimacy.
  - “西边的确有点土，但那是低调” (the west is a bit rustic, but that’s just being low-key) → **RL1**, implying a **social perception or mental map** of the area.
  - “不低调也不敢啊！” (you wouldn’t dare not be low-key) → **RL6**, suggesting **social pressure and hierarchy of influence**.
  - “朝阳洋气不老少” (Chaoyang is quite stylish) → **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**, describing lifestyle appeal.
  - “民营经济主导，总被西边看不起” (private economy-dominated, always looked down upon by the west) → **RL6**, as it reflects **economic status and symbolic hierarchy**.
  - “这世界总会有你看不上我，我看不上你的事儿！” (this world always has people looking down on each other) → **RL1**, as it reflects **mutual social boundary-making and regional identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **RL1** to establish **territorial identity and perception**, showing how people mentally map regions and assign symbolic value.
  - **RL6** is used to explain **why the west is seen as more legitimate** — through **deep-rooted social connections and economic influence**, suggesting that being “local” is tied to **social capital and community rootedness**.
  - **RL5** is used to contrast Chaoyang’s modernity and appeal with the **perceived rustic nature of the west**, but not as a quality-of-life judgment, rather as a **marker of identity difference**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse economic status or lifestyle alone** as the main criteria for being local — they are **descriptive contrasts**, not **definitional criteria**.
  - The author **does endorse social rootedness (RL6)** and **territorial perception (RL1)** as the **basis for evaluating who is more authentically local** and who has the right to judge others.
  - **RL4 (language/culture)** and **RL3 (family rootedness)** are **not present**.
  - **RL2 (administrative legitimacy)** is **not referenced**.
  - **RL7 (occupational symbolism)** is **not explicitly referenced**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines “local” not by where you live, but by **where your social connections are rooted**, especially in **traditional, socially powerful areas like Cuiwei**, which implies **RL6**.
  - The author also constructs a **mental map of regional identity**, where the **west is seen as more legitimate**, and Chaoyang is modern but less respected — this aligns with **RL1**.

The author suggests that **Haidian and Xicheng property ownership reflects a more stable, traditional, or ""rooted"" form of local identity**, while Chaoyang, although offering larger or more prestigious properties, is portrayed as more volatile or less ""authentic"" in terms of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * **""几代人都在海淀""** – generational rootedness in Haidian → **RL3**
  * **""西城海淀的优质房产保值度高""** – high property value retention in Xicheng and Haidian, used as a marker of quality or stability → **RL6**
  * **""朝阳很多盘跌的稀碎""** – real estate depreciation in Chaoyang, contrasted with the above → **RL6**
  * **""朝阳能买3.500平的明星小区""** – large, prestigious properties in Chaoyang, but not necessarily a sign of ""deep"" local identity → **RL6**
  * **""西城海淀也就只能买个改善盘大平层""** – implies a more modest but stable or rooted housing status in Xicheng and Haidian → **RL6**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * **RL3 (""几代人都在海淀"")** is used to emphasize **a long-standing, rooted local identity** in Haidian, contrasting with newer or more transient residents elsewhere.
  * **RL6 elements** are used to **evaluate and distinguish types of local identity** — property ownership in Haidian/Xicheng is seen as more **stable, authentic, or traditional**, while Chaoyang is portrayed as more speculative and less rooted.
  * The author does **not** suggest that **RL1 (territorial identity), RL2 (administrative legitimacy), RL4 (language/culture), RL5 (livability), or RL7 (occupation)** are criteria they personally use to define ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **clearly endorses** RL3 and RL6 as **criteria for distinguishing authentic or rooted ""local"" identity**, especially in contrast to more transient or speculative residents in Chaoyang.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author believes that **multi-generational rootedness (RL3)** in a place like Haidian contributes to a more authentic ""local"" identity. They also imply that **property ownership in stable, high-value areas like Xicheng and Haidian (RL6)** reflects a deeper, more rooted local identity compared to areas like Chaoyang, where property values are more volatile or speculative.

我小时候住海淀长大了住望京，后来孩子上学回海淀，个人感觉望京比较适合年轻人生活，休闲自在啥都有，海淀吧，我住这地儿，真就只能上学，啥啥都破破的，每一天都想着赶紧上完学搬家,RL5," *   The author is sharing their personal experience of living in two areas — **Haidian (海淀)** and **Wangjing (望京)** — and comparing the two. They express a **clear preference for Wangjing as a more suitable and enjoyable place for young people to live**, while describing Haidian primarily as a place for schooling, with negative sentiments about its overall livability.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The author mentions moving between areas based on life stage (growing up, having a child), indicating a **lifestyle-based evaluation of local areas**.
  *   They describe **Haidian as being solely for schooling**, implying a **functional use** of the area.
  *   They praise **Wangjing for its leisure, convenience, and livability**, indicating a **subjective quality-of-life standard** used to judge the area.
  *   These preferences are **personal but also evaluative**, suggesting criteria for what makes a place a ""good local"" area to live in.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **RL5 elements** (""休闲自在啥都有"", ""比较适合年轻人生活"") are central to the author's **positive evaluation of Wangjing** as a better ""local"" living space.
  *   The **negative RL5 elements** (""啥啥都破破的"") are used to **criticize Haidian's livability**, reinforcing the idea that it is not a desirable place to live outside of necessity (schooling).
  *   These evaluations are **not based on administrative status, cultural identity, or family history**, but on **personal experience of urban quality and functionality**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **clearly uses livability and functional convenience** as criteria to evaluate and compare local areas.
  *   These criteria are **not resisted** and are **explicitly tied to their judgment of which area is a better ""local"" place to live**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's **core argument is that Wangjing is a better ""local"" residential area than Haidian**, based on **functional livability and lifestyle quality**.
  *   This aligns with **RL5**, which evaluates regions based on **livability features** like convenience, facilities, and environmental quality, and uses these to judge whether a place is a ""good local"" area.

我住东二环 我爸妈住东四环 上班在西四环 我每天上班我感觉像出国 再赶上西四环交通管制 （海关排队,** RL1," *   The author's core expressive intent revolves around the **experience of feeling like they ""go abroad"" every day on their commute**, due to the **perceived regional separation and the experience of traffic control at the destination**. This metaphor implies a **strong sense of territorial or spatial identity difference** between where they live and where they work.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The author mentions specific locations: **东二环 (East Second Ring), 东四环 (East Fourth Ring), 西四环 (West Fourth Ring)** — indicating a **territorial awareness** and **spatial segmentation**.
  *   The phrase **“我每天上班我感觉像出国”** (I feel like I’m going abroad every day when I go to work) implies a **strong mental boundary** or **identity distinction** between the areas.
  *   The mention of **“西四环交通管制（海关排队”** (traffic control at West Fourth Ring – like customs queue) reinforces the **metaphor of crossing a border**, suggesting a **symbolic or psychological boundary** between regions.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The spatial references (东二环, 东四环, 西四环) are not just descriptive but serve to **highlight a perceived regional divide**.
  *   The metaphor of “going abroad” and “customs queue” is not just about inconvenience but functions to **symbolically define a boundary between “local” and “non-local” space**, where the workplace area is seen as **“foreign” or “outside the local zone”**.
  *   The author **implicitly accepts** the idea that **people from one ring may not feel at home in another**, thus constructing a **symbolic mental map** of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is clearly constructing a **mental map of local identity** based on **spatial segmentation and symbolic boundaries**.
  *   The criteria are not about administrative boundaries or personal history, but about **socially conventional territorial identity** — a **psychological sense of belonging tied to specific urban zones**.
  *   The metaphor of “going abroad” is strong enough to indicate that the author **accepts and uses** this **territorial logic** to define what feels “local” or not.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The RL category that best matches is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the author:
      *   Uses **mental maps** of urban ring roads to define **local vs. non-local space**.
      *   Implies a **symbolic boundary** between areas, with **identity and emotional differences**.
      *   Constructs a **socially conventional sense of territorial belonging**.

**Output:** RL1"
哈哈哈，东和西真的就像异地一样。开车去东边太难了，但我又不爱坐地铁,RL1," *   The author is expressing frustration and inconvenience regarding travel between the eastern and western parts of a city, comparing the difficulty to ""intercity"" or ""long-distance"" travel. The author prefers not to take the subway and finds driving difficult, which implies dissatisfaction with the transportation infrastructure or spatial layout.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is “东和西真的就像异地一样” (“East and west really feel like different cities”), which implies a perception of internal spatial division within a city.
  *   The phrase “开车去东边太难了” (“Driving to the east side is too hard”) relates to transportation and spatial accessibility.
  *   The phrase “不爱坐地铁” (“I don’t like taking the subway”) further emphasizes the author’s perception of poor connectivity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not directly defining who is ""local"" or setting identity boundaries, but is constructing a **mental map** of the city where the east and west are perceived as **functionally separate**, which may affect the sense of **local unity** or **regional cohesion**.
  *   The difficulty in moving between east and west implies a **symbolic boundary** based on accessibility and spatial perception, which could influence how people identify with or perceive different parts of the city.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The text reflects a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) — the author perceives a **symbolic division** between east and west, treating them as if they are different places, which could influence how people define or experience ""local"" identity within the city.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of administrative, cultural, familial, or economic criteria for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's perception of the east and west as ""like different cities"" aligns with **RL1**, as it reflects a **socially constructed mental map** that divides the city into distinct regions with different identities or experiences.
  *   This perception may imply that people from the east and west have **different lived experiences**, potentially influencing how they see themselves or others as “local” within the city.

**Step 6: Output Result**

内片确实是一坨，房价原来挺低的，房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾,RL5," *   The author is expressing a negative evaluation of an area (""内片确实是一坨""), linking its previously low housing prices to the emergence of undesirable elements or conditions (""容易滋生垃圾""). The core intent is to criticize the area's quality and possibly imply that it does not represent a ""good local"" area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""房价原来挺低的"" – Indicates low housing prices in the past.
  *   ""房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾"" – Links low housing prices to the emergence of undesirable people or conditions.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of low housing prices serves to explain why the area has degraded in quality. The author implies that lower housing prices attract undesirable elements, which negatively affects the area's status or perception.
  *   The author is **endorsing** the idea that housing price levels are a proxy for the quality of residents or the environment, and thus, by extension, a standard for evaluating whether an area can be considered a ""good"" or ""ideal"" local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not directly discussing administrative boundaries, cultural identity, family history, or social connections.
  *   The author is not describing a personal preference in isolation — they are making a **causal argument**: low housing prices → undesirable elements → degraded area.
  *   This logic clearly aligns with **RL5**, as it uses housing prices (a proxy for economic and functional quality of the area) to evaluate the area’s desirability or ""local value.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that housing prices are a key indicator of an area’s quality and that low prices lead to negative outcomes. This aligns with **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**, which includes economic and functional indicators like housing prices to define or evaluate ""local"" areas.

不算吧~最早那边是一大片荒地~小时候去石景山游乐园时下了地铁还要走好远才到~边上只有荒地什么都没有~后来慢慢建了小区~,"**  
RL3"," The author is reflecting on the transformation of the Shijingshan area from a largely undeveloped, remote region in their childhood to a more built-up residential area over time. The implication is that the area has undergone significant development, suggesting that its current status or perception as ""local"" is relatively recent or newly formed.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of childhood experience (""小时候去石景山游乐园时"") implies a personal growth history tied to the area.
  - Description of the area's transformation from荒地 (wasteland) to residential小区 (residential community) suggests a change in the region's social and physical identity.
  - Implicit contrast between old and new images of the area may relate to evolving perceptions of what constitutes the ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The childhood experience and memory of the area being undeveloped supports the idea that the author does not see the area as having deep historical rootedness or long-standing ""local"" status.
  - The gradual development of the area is used to question or downplay its traditional ""local"" identity, suggesting that the author sees ""localness"" as something tied to long-standing presence and historical continuity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author uses their **personal growth history** in the area and the **lack of early development** to question the area’s claim to being ""local"", implying that true local identity requires deeper historical roots or continuity.
  - This supports **RL3**, as the author's own childhood experience is used to judge the area’s status and legitimacy as ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is clearly endorsed by the author, who uses their early experience of the area being undeveloped to argue that it is not a traditional or deeply rooted ""local"" area.

RL5"," *   The author is expressing a positive emotional reaction to the spatial and environmental characteristics of ""Haidian New District"" — specifically, the presence of wide roads facing mountains, which makes one's mood suddenly become cheerful. This implies a favorable evaluation of the area's **environmental quality and livability**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""海淀新区"" (Haidian New District) — implies a territorial identity, possibly related to RL1 or RL2.
  *   ""大马路对着大山"" (wide roads facing big mountains) — highlights environmental and spatial layout features.
  *   ""心情一下就开朗了"" (mood suddenly becomes cheerful) — indicates a positive emotional response to the environment, possibly implying that such environmental features contribute to the area's **livability and quality of life**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase functions to **praise the area's environment**, implying that such features (open views, natural scenery, good spatial layout) make it a **pleasant and high-quality place to live**, thus contributing to its **""local value""** or **""local identity""** in a broader sense of what constitutes a desirable local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is clearly **endorsing** the idea that the **environmental quality and spatial layout** (wide roads, mountains in view) contribute to the area being **emotionally and psychologically pleasant**, which in turn enhances its **status or desirability as a ""local"" area**.
  *   This aligns with **RL5**, as the author is **directly linking environmental quality and spatial features to the evaluation of the area as ""good""** or ""pleasant"" — a standard for defining or appreciating a local area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is not discussing administrative boundaries, cultural habits, or family history. The focus is on **environmental and spatial features contributing to a sense of well-being**, which in turn enhances the area’s **local identity or local value**.
  *   This fits the **RL5** category, which involves evaluating or defining a region based on **environmental quality and functional livability**.

对于我这城里土生土长的北京人的陈旧的思想：东边过了东大桥就是农村。西边过了官园就是农村。北边出了北三环就是农村。南边过了自然博物馆就是农村。海淀区就中关村再往西北就农村。丰台都郊县原来打电话都带郊直费。通州是哪？哦你说通县呀。去趟顺义一天回不来得住村里。延庆我草得坐火车(原来真从西直门坐火车),"RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a **subjective mental map** of Beijing that reflects a **traditional, socially conventional view of urban and rural boundaries** based on long-standing perceptions. They are not merely describing geography, but rather revealing a **deeply ingrained cognitive boundary** of what is considered ""central Beijing"" (urban) versus ""the countryside"" (rural), which they themselves seem to have internalized from a young age as a native Beijinger.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text contains several RL-relevant elements:
  - Mentions of **specific geographical boundaries** (东大桥, 官园, 北三环, 自然博物馆, 中关村, etc.) that define where urban ends and rural begins — possibly **RL1**.
  - The author’s **own identity as a native Beijing resident** (""城里土生土长的北京人"") — possibly **RL3**.
  - Implicit **historical and cultural labels** (e.g., calling 通州 “通县”, 顺义 as requiring staying overnight, 延庆 requiring a train ride from 西直门) — possibly **RL1** or **RL4**.
  - Mentioning **calling fees (郊直费)** — possibly **RL5**, but **not directly used to define local identity**, so likely irrelevant.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **mental map of urban vs. rural boundaries** is central to the author's **perception of local identity** — it defines what areas they consider ""truly local"" (urban Beijing) and what areas are not.
  - The **author’s native status** reinforces the **authority and authenticity** of the perception, suggesting that this mental map is not arbitrary but rooted in **long-standing local identity**.
  - The **historical references and place-name changes** (通县 → 通州) and travel inconvenience imply that **some areas are culturally and spatially distant**, even if administratively part of Beijing.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The **core argument** is that the author, as a native Beijinger, holds a **traditional, socially accepted mental map** that defines the boundaries of “real Beijing” — this is **RL1**.
  - The **author’s native birth and upbringing** are used to justify the legitimacy of this perception — this is **RL3**.
  - Other elements (calling fees, travel time) are **not used to define local identity** but rather to illustrate **how distant or non-central** certain areas are — **not RL5**.
  - No strong linguistic or cultural habit indicators (RL4), administrative boundaries (RL2), or economic/social rootedness (RL6/RL7) are present.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly present — the author constructs a **symbolic geography** of Beijing, defining what areas are “truly local” and which are not, based on **long-standing social perceptions**.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is also present — the author's identity as a native Beijinger is used to **legitimize their perception** and give it weight.

老北京话里的东富西贵指的是二环以里，没朝阳什么事。而且是真正的二环城圈儿里，就是地铁2号线以里。朝阳那时候还农村呢，压根不在这个老话指的范围内。,"RL1, RL3, RL4"," The author is asserting that the traditional Beijing saying ""东富西贵"" (the east is wealthy, the west is noble) refers exclusively to the inner **Second Ring Road area**, specifically the area **within the Metro Line 2 loop**, and that **Chaoyang District** was not included in this traditional conceptualization of ""local Beijing"" at the time the saying originated. The author emphasizes that Chaoyang was still rural and thus **not part of the traditional ""local"" core identity** of Beijing.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老北京话里的东富西贵"" – Traditional cultural expression tied to local identity.
  - ""指的是二环以里"" – Geographical boundary defined by long-standing social understanding.
  - ""地铁2号线以里"" – Another way to define the same area, but based on a modern but widely accepted spatial reference.
  - ""朝阳那时候还农村呢"" – Indicates that Chaoyang was not historically part of the local core and thus not included in the traditional identity framework.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""东富西贵"" functions as a **symbol of traditional cultural-linguistic identity** (RL4), used to anchor the concept of ""local Beijing"" in historical consciousness.
  - The definition of the area as ""二环以里"" and ""地铁2号线以里"" serves as a **socially conventional territorial boundary** (RL1), used to demarcate who or what counts as part of the ""true local"" area.
  - The exclusion of Chaoyang due to its rural status at the time is based on **historical rootedness and growth context** (RL3), suggesting that being ""local"" is tied to being part of the historically central, developed area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the traditional boundary and cultural expression to define ""local Beijing identity"".
  - The **territorial boundary** and **historical rootedness** are used to **exclude Chaoyang** from being considered part of the traditional ""local"" identity.
  - The **cultural saying** is used to reinforce the legitimacy of the territorial definition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author defines the local area as the traditional inner city within the Second Ring Road and Metro Line 2 loop, a widely accepted mental map of old Beijing.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Chaoyang is excluded because it was rural and not part of the historically central, developed area — implying that only those from the historically urbanized zones are ""true locals"".
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author uses the traditional Beijing saying “东富西贵” to anchor the definition of local identity in cultural-linguistic heritage.

正解，老辈区的概念不强的，因为那个时候变化太多，可能他经历了好几次行政区的划分调动，所以基本上本地人只会说自己待的这个地方的地名，比如凤山门望江门四牌楼庆春孩儿巷武林门半道红卖鱼桥古荡三里亭这种，也就是现在的街道（镇）、小区（村）的概念，只有对外地的朋友，他不清楚这些地方的所以才会用区来表述。,RL1," The author is explaining how older generations in a city (likely a Chinese urban context) do not strongly identify with **district-level (区)** administrative divisions due to historical changes. Instead, they identify more with **micro-local place names** (e.g., 凤山门, 望江门, 四牌楼, etc.), which correspond to **streets, neighborhoods, or villages** — i.e., more granular, culturally-rooted spatial identities. The use of **district names** is only for **external communication** with those unfamiliar with the finer geography.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- Use of micro-local place names (凤山门, 望江门, etc.) → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**
- Disregard for administrative district names due to frequent boundary changes → **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** — but **negated**, not endorsed
- Reference to streets, neighborhoods, and villages as the true local identifiers → **RL1 again**, reinforcing conventional territorial identity
- Use of districts only for outsiders → implies **RL1 boundary logic** (us vs. them)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL1** plays a **central role**: the author is asserting that **local identity is defined not by administrative divisions but by socially conventional, historically embedded, small-scale place names**.
- **RL2** is **mentioned but resisted**: the author is **rejecting administrative legitimacy** as a valid or meaningful criterion for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- Only **RL1** is endorsed and used to define local identity.
- **RL2** is discussed but **explicitly rejected** as a meaningful identity marker.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author believes that **true local identity** is rooted in **socially conventional, small-scale place names** that reflect **historical and emotional attachments**, not in modern or shifting administrative boundaries.
- These micro-place names serve as **symbolic markers of local belonging**, used to distinguish **""us"" (locals)** from **""them"" (outsiders)**.

This experience helped them understand the local identity distinctions — particularly how people from **Yuhan** (an administrative suburb of Hangzhou) are often not considered ""true"" locals in the social or cultural sense, especially when compared to those from the city center.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **余杭 vs 市区 (urban core)** — Implies a socially accepted boundary or hierarchy between different parts of the city, suggesting a mental map or socially conventional territorial identity.
  - **骂了一顿说我市区没房子不要说自己是杭州人** — Highlights a social boundary drawn based on **residential location and property ownership**, implying a criterion used to judge ""localness"".
  - **乡下人** — A socially derogatory label used to denote someone from the outskirts, reflecting **RL1** (socially conventional territorial identity).
  - **只说自己杭州郊区或者直接说老余杭的** — Shows the author's adaptation to local identity norms, avoiding the label ""Hangzhou person"" due to social pressure, reinforcing the idea of **RL1**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The distinction between **余杭** and **市区** is not just administrative but symbolic — it reflects a **socially accepted hierarchy** of local identity.
  - The **insult and rejection** based on not owning a house in the city center is used by the author to illustrate how **local identity is socially constructed and policed**.
  - The author's **self-modification** of identity (saying “Hangzhou suburb” or “老余杭”) shows that they now **accept or at least recognize** the **socially conventional territorial logic** used by others.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly accepts** the idea that **people from Yuhan are not seen as ""true"" locals in Hangzhou** due to socially conventional understandings of territory and identity.
  - The author **does not endorse** the **hukou** or administrative boundary logic directly as a defining factor — instead, they focus on **social perception and mental maps**.
  - The author **does not emphasize cultural-linguistic or family rootedness**, but rather the **social perception of place of origin** and **residential status**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The key RL category is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — the author illustrates how **""老余杭"" is socially perceived as not ""real Hangzhou""**, and how this perception is enforced through **identity policing** and **social labeling** (e.g., calling someone 乡下人).
  - There is **no clear endorsement** of **RL2 (Administrative legitimacy)**, **RL3 (Family history)**, or **RL4 (Language/culture)**.
  - **RL6 (Depth of social roots or property ownership)** is **mentioned**, but not **endorsed** by the author as their own belief — it is **resisted** and used as a **tool of exclusion by others**, so it should not be annotated.

They emphasize that people from Yuhang usually say ""go to Hangzhou"" instead of ""go to the city center"", which reflects a **psychological distance and identity separation**. The final sentence — “we don’t feel a sense of belonging, and they don’t see us as their own” — clearly conveys a **subjective perception of social and emotional exclusion**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""一直都说是‘去杭州’，而不是去‘市区’""** — This implies a **linguistically and cognitively distinct regional identity**, not just a physical separation.
  *   **""没归属感""** — Indicates a lack of **emotional or psychological integration** into the ""local"" group.
  *   **""人家也不当我们是自己人""** — Suggests **social exclusion** and a **lack of mutual recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase **“去杭州”** is not just a linguistic habit — it is used to **symbolize a long-standing social and psychological boundary** between Yuhang and Hangzhou proper. It supports the author's core argument that **Yuhang residents are not socially or emotionally accepted as “local” Hangzhou people**.
  *   The lack of **belonging** and being **not accepted as one’s own** reinforces the author’s view that **local identity is not just administrative or geographical**, but also **socially and emotionally constructed**.

  - Reference to parents' occupation as ""工人 or 事业单位公务员"" (workers or public servants) → relates to **RL7: Occupational Symbolism**
  - Mention of ""家里没有土地"" (no land at home) → implies rejection of rural identity markers, possibly linked to **RL3** (family rootedness)
  - Implicit argument that the region should not be considered ""乡下"" based on these characteristics → indicates the author is proposing alternative criteria for defining ""local"" or ""urban"" identity

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author uses urban hukou as a key criterion to argue that people should not be classified as rural, indicating that they endorse administrative identity markers to define ""non-rural"" or ""urban local"" status.
  - **RL7 (Occupational Symbolism):** Parents' occupation as public servants or workers is used to reinforce the urban identity of individuals, contrasting with rural stereotypes.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The absence of land is used to refute rural identity, implying that the lack of rural-rooted family history supports urban identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL2** and **RL7** as valid criteria for distinguishing urban from rural identity.
  - The use of ""no land"" is more of a refutation of rural identity than an endorsement of a specific local identity, so **RL3** is not clearly endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author argues that **urban hukou (RL2)** and **urban occupational background (RL7)** are key criteria for defining urban identity and rejecting the label of ""rural"" or ""乡下"".

**Output:** RL2, RL7"
一样去杭州读个破大学反而还被歧视乡下人了，余杭读了12年书一点事都没有，天天说我们没归属感，那边又歧视我们，说我们乡下人，硬贴杭州，老底子杭州屁大点地方，吞了多少才发展起来自己没点数,"RL1, RL2, RL3"," The author is expressing frustration and resistance towards being labeled and discriminated against as a ""local from the countryside"" despite having spent 12 years in Yuhang (a district now part of Hangzhou), and resents the notion that ""real Hangzhou"" is limited to its old urban core. They are **rejecting the idea that long-term residence or administrative inclusion in Hangzhou grants one true ""local"" status**, and are **critiquing the symbolic boundary-making** that excludes people like them from being considered ""true locals"" based on territorial and cultural identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""余杭读了12年书一点事都没有"" → **RL3** (long-term residence and upbringing in the area)
- ""天天说我们没归属感"" → **RL1** (territorial identity and belonging)
- ""那边又歧视我们，说我们乡下人"" → **RL1** (social segregation based on regional identity)
- ""硬贴杭州"" → **RL1** (attempting to align with Hangzhou identity, but rejected)
- ""老底子杭州屁大点地方"" → **RL1** (historical perception of Hangzhou’s boundaries)
- ""吞了多少才发展起来"" → **RL2** (administrative expansion and annexation)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL3 (long-term residence)** is used to **challenge the legitimacy** of exclusion—i.e., “I’ve lived here all my life, yet I’m still considered an outsider.” This **questions the criteria for local identity** based on territorial belonging.
- **RL1 (historical and symbolic territorial identity)** is central to the author’s critique of how **""true locals""** are defined by a **narrow, historically rooted perception of Hangzhou**, which excludes newly incorporated areas like Yuhang.
- **RL2 (administrative legitimacy)** is mentioned to **highlight the contradiction** between administrative integration (Yuhang being part of Hangzhou) and **symbolic exclusion**—i.e., being part of the city on paper but not in practice.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **explicitly resists** the **RL1** logic that excludes people like them from being considered ""local"" based on **symbolic historical boundaries**.
- They **implicitly endorse** that **long-term residence (RL3)** and **administrative inclusion (RL2)** should count toward being considered ""local"", but these are **denied by the dominant perception**.
- The author **does not endorse** the **RL1** criteria, but they are **central to the critique**—i.e., the author is **reacting to** the symbolic ranking logic based on **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is **critiquing the symbolic ranking logic (RL1)** that defines ""true locals"" based on **historical, symbolic, and narrow territorial identity**, while also pointing out the **contradiction with administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and **personal rootedness (RL3)**.

一般当能答出杭州哪里（比如武林门，采荷，翠苑，朝晖这种称呼）后因为密码正确接下来的语言模式会自动切换为杭州话（特指老市区范围的杭州话，毕竟稍微隔几公里就会出现口音差异了）哈哈哈,"RL1, RL4"," The author is humorously describing a kind of ""local test"" — knowing specific neighborhood names in杭州 (e.g., 武林门, 采荷, etc.) functions like a ""password"" to being recognized as a local. Once this is confirmed, the interaction shifts to using the local dialect (杭州话), specifically the version spoken in the old urban core. This implies a belief that **true locals are those who not only know the area but also speak the authentic local dialect**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of specific neighborhood names (武林门, 采荷, etc.) — could imply **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  - Use of local dialect (杭州话), especially the old市区 version — implies **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**.
  - Implicit boundary drawn around the ""old市区"" version of the dialect — could imply **RL1** again, as it's based on conventional, socially accepted local identity boundaries.
  - Reference to slight geographical differences (几公里) causing dialect change — again supports **RL1** and **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **neighborhood names** serve as a kind of identity verification — a cultural and spatial understanding of what counts as ""local"" territory. The author implies that only real locals know these names, and this knowledge triggers a shift in interaction mode.
  - The **local dialect** is used as a marker of authenticity — once the ""password"" is passed, the real test begins. The dialect is not just a linguistic tool but a cultural boundary marker.
  - The **geographical nuance** (even within Hangzhou, accents change every few kilometers) reinforces the idea that being ""local"" is a fine-grained, socially conventional identity, not just administrative or functional.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that knowing traditional neighborhood names and speaking the authentic local dialect (杭州话 in the old市区 sense) are **criteria for identifying locals**.
  - These are **not just preferences or descriptions**, but **functional markers** the author uses or implies as **standards for defining local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly present: the author implies that knowing traditional neighborhood names is a sign of being local, and that there's a conventional understanding of which areas are ""core"" and which are peripheral.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is also clearly present: the author sees speaking the authentic local dialect (杭州话) as a key criterion for being recognized as a local, and even notes the importance of the specific variant of the dialect spoken in the old市区.

别说其他区了，我是西湖区三墩的浙大紫金港这边，小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州。对外都说自己三墩乡下人。,"** RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing a sense of **local identity rooted in a specific place (San Dun, Xihu District, near Zijingang Campus of Zhejiang University)** and describing how, even within the broader city of Hangzhou, there is a **hierarchical self-perception and identification based on place of origin within the city**. The phrase “对外都说自己三墩乡下人” (I call myself a rural person from San Dun when talking to outsiders) implies a **self-deprecating or self-positioning behavior when defining one’s local identity to outsiders**, based on cultural or spatial perception.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “西湖区三墩” (San Dun, Xihu District): a **geographical identity marker** within Hangzhou.
- “浙大紫金港” (Zijingang Campus of Zhejiang University): a **landmark or symbolic place**, possibly implying a sense of modernity or urbanity.
- “小时候去趟龙翔桥都说去杭州” (Going to Longxiang Bridge as a child was considered ""going to Hangzhou""): implies a **mental map or perception of what ""counts"" as the city center or ""real Hangzhou""**, and what is considered peripheral.
- “对外都说自己三墩乡下人” (When talking to outsiders, I say I’m from the countryside of San Dun): implies a **self-identification based on perceived cultural or spatial marginality**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author is not resisting or negating these ideas — they are **endorsing and using them as a basis for self-identification and perception of local identity**.
- The idea that going to Longxiang Bridge was once considered “going to Hangzhou” shows a **historical or socially conventional mental boundary** of what was considered the “real” city, reflecting **RL1**.
- The self-identification as a “rural person from San Dun” when speaking to outsiders reflects **a cultural-linguistic boundary of identity**, i.e., who counts as a “real local” and who doesn’t, reflecting **RL4**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author clearly endorses the **socially conventional boundary** of what is considered the core city vs. the periphery.
- The author also endorses a **cultural or linguistic distinction** — identifying themselves as “rural” when speaking to outsiders, implying that **language and perception** are used to distinguish locals.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL1** is matched: the author uses a **conventional mental map** to distinguish between “San Dun” and “Hangzhou proper” (e.g., Longxiang Bridge), showing how local identity is shaped by **historically and socially sedimented spatial perceptions**.
- **RL4** is matched: the **linguistic self-positioning as “rural”** when talking to outsiders implies a **cultural-linguistic boundary** used to define local identity.

不一定因为杭州市区的瞧不起周边的又因为杭州政府做的不地道很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感，问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了,N/A," The author is expressing a critique of the attitude of杭州市区 (urban Hangzhou) residents toward those from the surrounding areas, implying that due to the government's behavior (""杭州政府做的不地道""), people from various districts do not feel a sense of belonging to Hangzhou. The author further suggests that when someone is asked ""你哪里人"" (where are you from), it's not about administrative or geographic classification, but about **how one personally identifies** — indicating that the sense of being ""local"" should be based on **subjective self-identification**, not imposed labels.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""杭州市区的瞧不起周边的"" — implies a perceived identity boundary or social hierarchy based on regional identity within Hangzhou.
  - ""杭州政府做的不地道"" — suggests administrative legitimacy is a factor in how people feel about their local identity.
  - ""很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感"" — indicates a lack of **emotional or psychological attachment** to the broader Hangzhou identity.
  - ""问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了"" — emphasizes **self-identification** as the core of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The perceived hierarchy between urban Hangzhou and surrounding areas points to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** — the author critiques a commonly held perception that urban Hangzhou is more ""authentically local"" than surrounding areas.
  - The government's behavior (""不地道"") is not just a complaint about governance but is framed as a reason why people don't feel connected to Hangzhou — this touches on **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**, as the author implies that administrative legitimacy should contribute to a sense of belonging.
  - The lack of belonging implies that **RL1 and RL2 standards are failing**, and the author proposes an alternative: personal self-identification as the real basis of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **critiques** the use of conventional territorial identity (RL1) and administrative legitimacy (RL2) as bases for local identity.
  - The author **proposes** that self-identification is the **true standard** for defining local identity.
  - Since the author critiques RL1 and RL2, these **should not be annotated** unless they are endorsed, which they are not.
  - The author **does not propose any of the other RL categories** (RL3–RL7) as defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author **does not endorse** any of the RL1–RL7 criteria as defining ""local identity"".
  - Instead, the author **proposes a subjective, self-identified basis** for local identity, which is **not included in the RL framework**.
  - Therefore, **no RL category applies** to criteria explicitly endorsed or implied by the author.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output:"
我西湖区三墩镇，我都说自己杭州乡下人……跟他们城里人讲的话不一样,"RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing a self-identification as a ""Hangzhou countryside person"" from the Sancha Town in Xihu District. This self-identification is based on a perceived difference—particularly in speech—between themselves and ""city people."" The core intent is to assert a distinction in local identity based on cultural-linguistic features and possibly a conventional territorial identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""西湖区三墩镇"" (Sancha Town, Xihu District): a specific location, potentially related to RL1 (territorial identity) or RL3 (rootedness).
  - ""我都说自己杭州乡下人"" (I always say I’m a Hangzhou countryside person): self-identification that reflects a perceived local identity boundary, potentially RL1 or RL3.
  - ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" (The way I speak is different from city people): clearly references linguistic difference, pointing to RL4 (cultural-linguistic recognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The location ""西湖区三墩镇"" is not used to assert rootedness or administrative belonging, but rather as a **contextual background** for the author’s identity.
  - The phrase ""我都说自己杭州乡下人"" serves to **construct a contrastive identity**—not urban, hence rural/local—but this identity is based on **socially conventional mental mapping**, not administrative or genealogical logic.
  - ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" is the **core functional element** that defines the boundary of local identity in this context. It is used to **justify the self-identification as a ""countryside person""** by highlighting a linguistic and cultural distinction.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not use administrative legitimacy (RL2)** or family rootedness (RL3) to define their identity.
  - The author **does not emphasize economic status (RL6)**, occupational symbolism (RL7), or livability/environmental quality (RL5).
  - The author **does use linguistic difference (RL4)** and **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** to define the boundary between ""local countryside"" and ""city people.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author self-identifies as ""Hangzhou countryside,"" which implies a conventional understanding of territorial categorization—rural vs. urban Hangzhou. This is not based on administrative or genealogical criteria but on **socially shared mental maps** of local identity.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author explicitly defines the boundary of identity through language difference (""讲的话不一样""). This is a **core criterion** used to distinguish between ""us"" (local countryside people) and ""them"" (city people), thus playing a **central role** in the author’s expression of local identity.

They mention that urban dwellers (e.g., from Shangcheng or Xiacheng) look down on rural residents (e.g., from Xihu District), despite the latter possibly being wealthier. The author also notes a linguistic difference — rural areas speak ""Old Yuhang dialect,"" while urban areas speak ""Hangzhou dialect."" This is framed humorously, but it conveys a sense of **linguistically and culturally rooted social boundary** between ""local"" urbanites and rural residents.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""城里的就不太看得起我们这种乡下的"" (Urban people don't look up to us rural folks) → implies **social distinction** and **hierarchy**, possibly related to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**.
  *   - ""我们西湖区都是乡下地方"" (Our Xihu District is a rural area) → suggests **territorial categorization**, possibly **RL1**.
  *   - ""讲的都是老余杭的话，跟他们上城下城都是讲杭州话的"" (We speak Old Yuhang dialect, unlike Shangcheng/Xiacheng people who speak Hangzhou dialect) → **linguistic identity**, directly pointing to **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not resisting or opposing the criteria — rather, they are **acknowledging and reproducing** the social boundary between urban and rural locals. Even though the author adds a humorous tone, they accept that:
      *   There is a **territorial distinction** (RL1) — rural vs. urban areas.
      *   There is a **linguistic distinction** (RL4) — dialect differences are markers of identity.
      *   These distinctions are used to **evaluate social standing** and **local identity**, not just describe differences.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly accepts the conventional view that rural areas like Xihu are not part of the ""urban local"" core and are looked down upon.
  *   - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The author explicitly identifies dialect differences as a distinguishing feature, which plays a central role in defining who is considered ""local"" or not in the urban hierarchy.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's argument is that **linguistic and territorial identities** are used to distinguish between types of ""local"" people. Even though rural locals may be wealthier, they are still seen as less authentic or less central ""locals"" due to their **dialect** and **regional background**. These are not just descriptive differences but **evaluative standards** that the author implicitly accepts.

This reflects the author's **linguistic and cultural basis** for distinguishing between ""local"" and ""non-local"" areas or people.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""西湖区也是乡下"" (West Lake District is also rural) – implies a **mental map** or **regional hierarchy**.
  *   ""我们这讲的都是余杭话"" (We speak Yuhang dialect here) – indicates **linguistic identity**.
  *   ""其他几个区讲的都是杭州话"" (Other districts speak Hangzhou dialect) – reinforces the **cultural-linguistic boundary**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is constructing a **boundary between ""local"" and ""non-local""** based on **language and regional identity**.
  *   The statement that ""西湖区是乡下"" (West Lake is rural) is not just a geographic observation but a **symbolic ranking** based on **linguistic and cultural legitimacy**.
  *   The **Yuhang dialect** is being used as a marker of **non-core local identity**, contrasting with the **Hangzhou dialect**, which the author seems to associate with **urban, authentic local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is clearly using **language/dialect** and **regional categorization** to define who or what counts as ""local"".
  *   These are **endorsed**, not resisted, and are **explicitly used to evaluate the local identity** of a district.
  *   There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family history, economic status, or functional livability, so those categories are **not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
      *   The author is proposing a **mental map** where certain areas (those speaking Hangzhou dialect) are considered **core local**, and others (speaking Yuhang dialect) are considered **non-core or peripheral**, even if geographically within the city.
  *   **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
      *   The **dialect** spoken is being used as a **criterion for local identity**, distinguishing ""us"" (Hangzhou dialect speakers) from ""them"" (Yuhang dialect speakers).

那你是杭州市区的吧，我是富阳的，以前是独立的市，前几年才划进杭州的,RL1," The author is distinguishing between being from the ""urban area of Hangzhou"" and being from ""Fuyang"", which was previously an independent city and was only recently incorporated into Hangzhou administratively. The author implicitly emphasizes that this administrative change does not necessarily equate to a shared local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""富阳的"" (from Fuyang) – suggests a regional identity.
  - ""以前是独立的市"" (used to be an independent city) – implies a historical and possibly emotional separation from Hangzhou.
  - ""前几年才划进杭州的"" (was only incorporated into Hangzhou a few years ago) – highlights a recent administrative change.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase “以前是独立的市” suggests that the author sees Fuyang as having a separate identity from Hangzhou, based on its historical status — this plays a role in resisting the idea that Fuyang is naturally or historically part of Hangzhou.
  - The phrase “前几年才划进杭州的” indicates that the author views the administrative change as a recent and possibly superficial integration, not a deep or organic merging of identities.
  - The overall tone implies that the author does **not** equate administrative inclusion with local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the administrative change (RL2) as a sufficient basis for identifying as Hangzhou “local”.
  - Instead, the author implies that the **historical territorial identity** (RL1) — Fuyang being an independent city — is more significant in shaping local identity than the recent administrative reclassification.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author emphasizes that Fuyang was once an independent city, suggesting that this historical identity still matters in how people perceive local identity, despite the administrative change.
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — While mentioned, it is **not endorsed** as a valid or sufficient basis for defining local identity. Instead, it is used to contrast with the historical identity.

你猜怎么着，你划的滨江萧山这边本地人，平时去市区都会说：去杭州玩，还有东边划得都到七堡了，我那边的同学可不认为他是市中心的你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗,"RL1, RL2"," The author is expressing a critical view of how certain areas are being administratively or conceptually ""划进去"" (included) as part of the ""local"" area — specifically referring to滨江 (Binjiang) and 萧山 (Xiaoshan), which are districts of Hangzhou but traditionally not seen as the core city area. The author mocks the idea that people from these areas refer to going to the city center as ""去杭州玩"" (""going to Hangzhou to play""), implying they don't feel fully integrated into the core identity of Hangzhou. The author also suggests that the inclusion of these areas is more about self-interest (""你这么划是把自己家先划进去了呗"" — ""you're just trying to include your own home first"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""划进""** — clearly points to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it involves the idea of administrative inclusion or boundary expansion.
  - **""去杭州玩""** — implies a **psychological boundary** and a **mental map** of what is considered the ""core"" of Hangzhou versus the periphery, pointing to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  - The author's **personal experience** of having classmates from the eastern part (七堡) not seeing themselves as part of the city center — this may imply **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, but it's not clearly stated that the author or the classmates base their identity on birthplace or generational rootedness. It's more about perception.
  - No mention of language, culture, or dialect — so **RL4** is not present.
  - No mention of facilities, environment, or livability — so **RL5** is not present.
  - No mention of social connections, property ownership, or economic status — so **RL6** is not present.
  - No mention of occupation or occupational identity — so **RL7** is not present.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** plays a **central role** in the author's critique — the author is skeptical of the legitimacy of expanding administrative boundaries to include areas like Binjiang and Xiaoshan and sees it as self-serving.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** also plays a **central role** — the author points out that people from these newly included areas still feel like outsiders when going to the core city, indicating a **socially constructed mental map** of what ""Hangzhou"" really is.
  - **RL3** is only indirectly referenced and not clearly used by the author as a criterion to define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly endorses** the idea that **administrative inclusion does not equate to real local identity**, and that **mental maps and social perceptions** matter more.
  - Therefore, **RL1 and RL2 are both endorsed by the author** as criteria for defining ""local people"" or evaluating ""local"" areas.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is challenging the idea that administrative boundary changes (RL2) can redefine local identity and instead emphasizes the enduring power of socially conventional territorial identity (RL1), where people still distinguish between the ""real"" city center and newly included areas.

**Step 6: Output Result**

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,"RL1, RL3"," *   The author is describing a former colleague who is a native Hangzhou local and whose life轨迹 (trajectory) is confined to three specific roads: where her parents live (Jiefang Road), where she lives after marriage (Fengqi Road), and where she works (Qingchun Road). The key implication is that despite being ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (a native and bred Hangzhou local), her actual geographic familiarity with the city is limited to these three roads.
  *   The author's tone seems to subtly suggest that being a ""local"" doesn't necessarily equate to comprehensive knowledge or broad familiarity with the entire city — it may be more about **where one lives, works, and has family roots**, and less about wide-ranging knowledge of the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" — strongly implies **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as it emphasizes being born and raised locally.
  *   ""爸妈住解放路"" — suggests family roots in a specific local area, reinforcing **RL3**.
  *   The focus on **residential and work locations** — Jiefang Road, Fengqi Road, Qingchun Road — implies a **territorial or functional understanding of local identity**, potentially linking to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) or **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), depending on how it's framed.
  *   The limitation of local knowledge to just three roads may also hint at a **functional or symbolic boundary** of what constitutes ""local"" in the author's mind — potentially **RL1** again.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" is used to **affirm the colleague’s local identity**, and the author does not dispute or negate this. So **RL3** is clearly endorsed.
  *   The mention of specific roads is not just descriptive — it functions to **question or redefine** what it means to be a ""local"" — i.e., it's not about knowing the whole city, but about **where one lives, works, and has family ties**.
  *   This implies a **functional or symbolic territorial understanding** of local identity — not based on administrative boundaries or legal status, but on **where one's life is embedded** — pointing to **RL1**.
  *   There's no mention of dialect, cultural habits, economic status, or occupational symbolism, so **RL2, RL4, RL5, RL6, and RL7** are not supported.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does endorse** the idea that being born and raised in Hangzhou qualifies someone as a local — **RL3**.
  *   The author also seems to imply that **local identity is tied to the specific places where one lives and works**, rather than the entire city — this supports **RL1**, as it reflects a **socially conventional or functional understanding of local territorial identity**.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of administrative legitimacy (RL2), cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4), functional livability (RL5), social roots (RL6), or occupational symbolism (RL7).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that being a local is partly about being born and raised in the city — **RL3**.
  *   But the author also implies that local identity is tied to the **specific roads and places where one lives and works**, which reflects a **socially conventional or functional understanding of local territorial identity** — **RL1**.
  *   So, the author uses both **RL1** and **RL3** to construct a nuanced view of local identity — one that includes **historical rootedness** and a **symbolic, limited territorial understanding**.

你都划到萧山了，就把我最顶上的大塘栖也划进去呗，让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验,"RL1, RL2, RL6"," The author is expressing a mix of irony and sarcasm toward the idea of administrative expansion — specifically, the inclusion of areas like Xiaoshan into the ""urban"" or ""central"" part of the city. The author implies that if Xiaoshan is now considered part of the city, then even the most remote area they know — Dangtang — should also be included, so they too can experience what it's like to ""live in the city center."" The underlying sentiment is a critique of how loosely or arbitrarily the concept of the “urban area” is being applied.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “你都划到萧山了” (you've already included Xiaoshan) implies a discussion about **administrative boundary changes**.
  - The phrase “把我最顶上的大塘栖也划进去呗” (just include my most remote Dangtang too) is a rhetorical exaggeration suggesting that if Xiaoshan is considered part of the city, then even the farthest place should be included — hinting at **socially conventional mental maps**.
  - The phrase “让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验” (let me experience what it's like to live in the city center) implies a contrast between the **perceived status of being in the city center vs. being on the periphery**, and questions the legitimacy or meaning of being “local” if the boundaries are expanded so loosely.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The mention of “划到” (included into) directly refers to administrative boundary expansion, and the author is mocking the logic that allows Xiaoshan to be considered part of the city. This shows the author sees administrative legitimacy as a **criterion being used**, but **they are critical of it** — still, this is part of their argument about how ""local"" identity is being stretched.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The rhetorical suggestion that even Dangtang should be included reflects a conventional understanding of spatial hierarchy — Xiaoshan is seen as a borderline case, and Dangtang is even more peripheral. The author is using this to critique the **social perception of what counts as ""urban"" or ""local""**, suggesting that the conventional understanding is being ignored.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The sarcastic desire to “体验住在市区” (experience living in the city center) implies that being “in the city” carries a **symbolic or status value**, which the author is questioning or mocking — again, part of their argument that this status is being diluted.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the administrative boundary expansion, but they **do reference it as a criterion** used by others to define “local” identity.
  - The author **uses the conventional spatial hierarchy (RL1)** to question the legitimacy of the new definitions.
  - The **symbolic value of being in the city (RL6)** is part of the author’s critique — they imply that this value is being undermined.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s argument revolves around the **arbitrary or expansive use of administrative boundaries (RL2)** and the **conventional understanding of spatial hierarchy (RL1)** to define “local” identity.
  - The **symbolic status of being in the city center (RL6)** is used to highlight the irony — if the city can be expanded so much, then even the most remote places should be included.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: `RL1, RL2, RL6`"
杭州人至少要说杭州话，萧山话杭州人都听不懂，硬划进杭州市区，别说杭州人了，问问萧山人干吗？,**RL4**," The author is arguing that being a ""local"" (specifically a ""Hangzhou person"") involves more than just administrative designation — it includes cultural-linguistic identity. The author implies that speaking the local dialect (Hangzhouhua) is a key criterion for being considered a true local. They also challenge the idea of forcibly incorporating areas like Xiaoshan into Hangzhou without regard for cultural and linguistic differences.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “杭州人至少要说杭州话” → Points to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**
  - “萧山话杭州人都听不懂” → Also points to **RL4**
  - “硬划进杭州市区” → Points to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**
  - Implicitly rejecting administrative designation as the sole criterion → Resisting RL2, but still referencing it

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** plays a **central supportive role**, used by the author to **argue against the legitimacy of administrative definitions of ""local""**. The author believes that shared language is a more authentic marker of local identity than administrative boundaries.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is **explicitly questioned** — the author critiques the idea that just because Xiaoshan is administratively ""划进"" (incorporated into) Hangzhou, its people are considered Hangzhou locals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the **linguistic criterion** (RL4) as the **true standard** for defining who is a Hangzhou local.
  - The author **resists** the **administrative criterion** (RL2), suggesting it's not a valid standard.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines ""Hangzhou person"" not by where you live or where you're administratively assigned, but by whether you speak the local dialect. This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** as the **core endorsed criterion**.
  - Although **RL2** is mentioned, it is **explicitly resisted**, not endorsed, so it should **not be annotated**.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: **RL4**"
"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。
 那么任嚣城又有怎样深厚的历史故事呢？它和现在的广州又有怎样的密切联系呢？感兴趣的朋友请看下期小明的讲解哦",** RL1," The author aims to clarify the evolving definition and perception of ""Guangzhou city"" over time, especially distinguishing between historical and contemporary understandings, and contrasting how **outsiders** (e.g., tourists) versus **locals** (e.g., Cantonese natives) define what counts as the ""real"" or ""core"" Guangzhou area. The author emphasizes **historical sedimentation**, **regional identity**, and **local mental maps** in defining the scope of ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Historical evolution of city boundaries (秦汉时期的“任嚣城”, 番禺城, 1921年设市, 东山并入越秀区 in 2005): RL1, RL2
  - Outsiders vs. locals’ perception of Guangzhou city scope:越秀、天河、海珠 vs. 老四区（越秀、东山、荔湾、河南）: RL1
  - Specific local symbolic meaning of ""河南"" (南华东、同福西) and its distinction from broader Hai Zhu district: RL1
  - Discussion of former city limits (桂花岗, 环市北 as farmland): RL1
  - Emphasis on **mental maps** and **identity-based cognition** of what constitutes the ""real"" Guangzhou: RL1

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **historical and emotional regional cognition** (RL1) to **challenge the common tourist perception** and **reclaim local identity** based on **long-standing local mental maps**.
  - The distinction between **administrative changes** (RL2) and **local perception** suggests that the author does **not prioritize administrative legitimacy** (e.g., post-2005 boundary changes), but rather **socially conventional territorial identity**.
  - The text **does not** treat **birthplace, dialect, occupation, or economic status** as criteria for defining ""local identity"", so RL3–RL7 are not endorsed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** a **historically grounded, socially conventional, identity-based understanding** of Guangzhou city limits.
  - The author **resists** the tourist or administrative understanding of the city and **promotes a local, identity-based mental map**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs the argument using **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, emphasizing **local perception, symbolic meaning, and historically sedimented mental maps** to define who counts as part of ""Guangzhou locals"" and what areas are considered ""core"" Guangzhou.

**Output:** RL1"

RL2"," The author presents a historical timeline of the administrative changes of the region now known as ""花都区"" (Huadu District), emphasizing its evolving administrative status and eventual incorporation into Guangzhou City. The core expressive intent is to **describe the administrative legitimacy and historical evolution of the region's status**, culminating in its current identity as a district of Guangzhou.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of historical administrative changes (e.g., ""属广州府"", ""划为广州市属县"", ""撤市设区"")
  - Emphasis on formal administrative transitions and jurisdictional changes
  - Use of official names and dates to mark administrative milestones

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The historical narrative is used to **legitimize the current administrative identity** of Huadu as part of Guangzhou.
  - Each transition is framed as a formal, legal change in status, not a cultural or personal one.
  - The author **does not express personal identity, cultural belonging, or social integration**, but rather focuses on **administrative legitimacy**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** is clearly endorsed and used to define the region's identity evolution.
  - There is **no mention of cultural identity, birthplace, language, or social status** that would relate to other RL categories.
  - The author **does not resist** any criteria but clearly **emphasizes administrative history**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The text aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as it outlines how the region's identity and affiliation have changed through official administrative decisions and legal boundary adjustments.
  - It reflects how **legal and administrative recognition** is used to define the scope and identity of the region.

**Output:**
RL2"
没错，大致就是东山还没并入的越秀区，还有一些后来并入的比如矿泉街道、桂花岗也不算进去,** RL2," The author is expressing a view on which areas should or should not be considered part of the ""local"" identity of越秀区 (Yuexiu District), specifically referring to areas that were not yet incorporated (like Dongshan) and some recently incorporated areas (like Kuangquan Street and Guihuagang) that are also not considered truly ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of ""还没并入"" (not yet incorporated) and ""后来并入"" (incorporated later) — relates to **administrative boundary changes**.
  - The author is drawing a distinction between areas that are ""genuinely local"" and those that are not, based on **administrative legitimacy and timing of incorporation**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The reference to administrative incorporation timing is **central** to the author's argument: only those areas that have been historically and administratively part of Yuexiu are considered truly local.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that administrative legitimacy (i.e., when an area was incorporated and whether it has a long-standing administrative relationship with the district) determines local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly uses **administrative legitimacy** as a standard to judge what counts as ""local"".
  - There is no mention of culture, language, family history, or economic factors playing a role in the author’s judgment.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This fits **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses the logic of administrative incorporation and historical affiliation to define which areas and people can be considered ""local"" within Yuexiu District.

我小时候一直在河南住，满口番禺顺德乡下口音，乡下仔来的,"** RL3, RL4, RL7"," *   The author is describing their upbringing in Henan and their strong accent from Panyu Shunde countryside, indicating a sense of being perceived as a ""country boy"" due to these characteristics.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""我小时候一直在河南住"" (I grew up in Henan) — potentially related to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  *   ""满口番禺顺德乡下口音"" (I have a strong Panyu Shunde rural accent) — potentially related to **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  *   ""乡下仔来的"" (came from the countryside) — potentially related to **RL7** (Occupational Symbolism), if linked to rural identity and social perception.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL3 (Growth History):** The author implies that growing up in Henan (not a local area) contributes to being perceived as an outsider. This supports the idea that local identity is tied to one’s upbringing.
  *   **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic):** The rural accent is directly linked to how the author is perceived and categorized by others, clearly functioning as a marker of local/non-local identity.
  *   **RL7 (Occupational/Organic Identity):** The phrase ""乡下仔"" (country boy) implies a rural background, which the author presents as a reason for being seen as non-local. Though not a job per se, it reflects a rural lifestyle or social class, which is used to distinguish locals from non-locals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not resisting these criteria — rather, they are **implicitly accepting** that upbringing location and accent are **used by society (and implicitly themselves)** to judge local identity.
  *   These elements are **used to define ""local identity""** — the author presents them as reasons why they are seen as non-local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that their **upbringing in Henan (RL3)** and **rural accent (RL4)** are criteria used to judge whether someone is considered a local.
  *   The phrase ""乡下仔"" (RL7) also reflects a **rural identity** that is implicitly used to distinguish locals from outsiders.

**Output:** RL3, RL4, RL7"
对哈哈哈 有祠堂有分红有地 从来没怀疑过自己,"RL3, RL6**"," The author is expressing a strong sense of local identity rooted in tangible and symbolic markers such as the presence of ancestral halls (祠堂), community dividends (分红), and land ownership (有地). These elements are not just described as features of their environment — they are used to affirm the author's **unquestionable identification with the local community** (""从来没怀疑过自己"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “有祠堂” (ancestral halls) — suggests **cultural and familial rootedness**, possibly linking to RL3 and RL6.
  - “有分红” (community dividends) — implies **economic integration and benefit from local resources**, linking to RL6.
  - “有地” (owning land) — implies **deep social and economic roots**, also linking to RL6.
  - “从来没怀疑过自己” (never doubted themselves) — indicates **a firm self-identification as local**, supported by the above elements.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The ancestral hall represents **historical and cultural continuity**, affirming that the author’s family has a long-standing presence in the area (RL3).
  - The community dividends and land ownership are **economic and social indicators** that reinforce the author’s legitimacy and rootedness in the local area (RL6).
  - Together, these elements are not just background features — they **function as the author's own criteria for affirming their local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History): The presence of ancestral halls implies generational continuity and historical rootedness.
  - RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism): Dividends and land ownership are explicitly used by the author to affirm their deep integration into the local social and economic fabric.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs their local identity through both **historical and familial rootedness** (RL3) and **economic and social integration** (RL6). These are not just features of their life — they are **endorsed as valid and sufficient criteria** for affirming one's status as a ""local"".

**Output: RL3, RL6**"
从来不怀疑自己，因为年年有分红，有祠堂有时候吃饭都要走去祠堂,"RL3, RL6"," *   The author is asserting a sense of confidence or certainty in their local identity, rooted in the idea of **receiving annual dividends** and having a **local祠堂 (ancestral hall)** where meals are even taken. This implies a deep, **institutionalized and culturally embedded connection** to the local area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""年年有分红"" (receives dividends every year) – potentially related to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**
  *   ""有祠堂"" (has an ancestral hall) – potentially related to **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**
  *   ""吃饭都要走去祠堂"" (even meals are taken at the ancestral hall) – reinforces the **cultural and familial rootedness**, also pointing toward **RL3** and possibly **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""年年有分红"" functions as a **concrete, material indicator** of belonging and rootedness in the local community, not just as an economic benefit but as a **symbol of legitimacy and inclusion** in the local social structure.
  *   ""有祠堂"" and ""吃饭都要走去祠堂"" serve as **symbolic and cultural markers** of local identity — suggesting a **deep ancestral and communal connection**, where daily life is integrated with traditional local institutions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **clearly endorses** the idea that receiving **annual dividends** is a sign of being a ""real local"", indicating **economic integration and social rootedness**.
  *   The presence and use of a **祠堂 (ancestral hall)** indicates **family historical rootedness** and **cultural practice**, both of which are used by the author to affirm their local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL6** is matched because the author uses the **receipt of dividends** as a **symbol of inclusion, rootedness, and economic legitimacy** in the local community.
  *   **RL3** is matched because the **ancestral hall (祠堂)** implies **family historical rootedness** — a multi-generational connection to the area, which the author uses to affirm their local identity.

我战友台山阿伯，十几岁才入户大石那边，但是也一样有分红，不知道他们家怎么操作的,"RL2, RL6"," The author is expressing surprise or curiosity about a specific case — a comrade's family (referred to as ""台山阿伯"") who only officially registered (""入户"") in the Dashi area in their teenage years but still receives community dividends. The author seems puzzled about how this was possible, implying that there may be an unusual or special way of handling such matters. The key point is the connection between **official household registration (hukou)** and **community dividends**, both of which are linked to local identity in a socio-economic and administrative sense.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""十几岁才入户大石那边"" — refers to **administrative registration (hukou)** timing, which is relevant to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - ""也一样有分红"" — refers to **community dividends**, which are linked to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of late hukou registration in Dashi suggests that **official administrative status was not early-established**, yet the family still enjoys economic benefits tied to local community membership.
  - The author is surprised by this, implying that **they believe such benefits usually require earlier or more legitimate administrative or social integration**.
  - Therefore, the author is **endorsing the idea** that administrative registration and access to community dividends are **important markers of local identity**, even though this particular case defies the norm.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly treats **household registration (hukou)** as a standard for understanding local identity — **RL2**.
  - The author also treats **community dividends** as a meaningful indicator of local status or rootedness — **RL6**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s surprise at this case implies that **they expect hukou registration and access to local economic benefits (like dividends) to align with and define local identity**. They are not rejecting these standards but are instead puzzled when they don’t align, which confirms their implicit endorsement.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Despite her husband being originally from Zhejiang and having lived in Guangzhou for over twenty years—fluently speaking Cantonese—the author considers him a ""老广"". In contrast, her two children, though born and raised in Guangzhou, are not considered ""老广"" because they do not speak Cantonese. The author clearly defines ""local identity"" based on **linguistic and cultural fluency**, not place of birth, upbringing, or length of residence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **speaking Cantonese (白话)** as a key differentiator between ""Guangzhou people"" and others.
  - The husband is **born outside Guangzhou**, lived there for 20+ years, and speaks fluent Cantonese.
  - The children are **born and raised in Guangzhou** but **do not speak Cantonese**, and thus are not considered ""老广"".
  - The author **does not emphasize administrative, territorial, or economic factors**, nor does she mention family history or social roots as the defining criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - **Speaking Cantonese** is used as the **core evaluative standard** by which the author judges whether someone is a ""real local"" (老广).
  - The husband, despite not being born in Guangzhou, is accepted as a local due to his **linguistic fluency**.
  - The children, despite being born and raised in Guangzhou, are **not accepted as locals** due to the **lack of linguistic fluency**.
  - This shows that **language is the primary symbolic boundary** the author uses to define ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** linguistic fluency in Cantonese as the **defining criterion** for being considered a ""Guangzhou person"".
  - Other factors such as **birthplace, upbringing, or length of residence** are **not endorsed** as sufficient or necessary conditions.
  - The author does **not resist** or negate any other criteria; rather, she **constructs her own standard** based on **language**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author defines ""local people"" based on **language (Cantonese)** and **linguistic fluency**, which she sees as the **key cultural marker** of being a ""老广"".
  - Other RL categories (e.g., RL1, RL2, RL3, RL6) are **not endorsed** as defining criteria by the author.

They note that this phenomenon is common among several of their Guangzhou friends, implying a sense of shared identity loss.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key point is the shift away from speaking Cantonese after entering daycare.
  * The author links this to identity erosion among local Guangzhou people.
  * The use of 白话 (Cantonese), and the concern about children only understanding but not speaking it, suggests a linguistic and cultural shift.
  * The author is not just describing a personal issue but sees it as a broader trend among locals.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author implicitly argues that **language** is a crucial marker of local identity — specifically, the ability to **speak** Cantonese, not just understand it.
  * The concern is not about language fluency alone, but about **identity transmission** across generations.
  * The author sees this linguistic shift as a **threat to local identity** and implies that daycare and broader social changes are contributing to this.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **values** Cantonese as a core component of being a local (Guangzhou person).
  * They **lament** the loss of this linguistic identity marker among children.
  * The author **implicitly defines** local identity through language use — specifically, the ability to speak Cantonese fluently.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author's concern centers around the **loss of cultural-linguistic identity** among local children.
  * This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author uses language (Cantonese) as a key criterion for defining ""local"" identity.

**Output: RL4**"
真系讲白话，好滴，吹水都方便好多割，普通话少小小味道，哈哈哈哈,** RL4," * The author is expressing a preference for speaking Cantonese (""讲白话"") and implying that it makes chatting (""吹水"") much easier and more convenient. The phrase ""真系讲白话"" (really speaking Cantonese) suggests an emphasis on linguistic authenticity. The author also contrasts this with Putonghua (""普通话"") by noting it has ""少小小味道"" (a little less flavor), implying a weaker local connection or identity when Putonghua is used. The tone is casual and humorous, but there is an implicit sense of linguistic and cultural belonging.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase ""讲白话"" (speaking Cantonese) points to a linguistic behavior.
  * The contrast with ""普通话"" (Putonghua) suggests a cultural-linguistic boundary.
  * The humor and preference expressed indicate a positive evaluation of local linguistic norms.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The use of ""讲白话"" functions as a **marker of local identity**—the author is signaling that using Cantonese is a key part of being “one of us” and facilitates social interaction.
  * The author implicitly endorses **Cantonese as a criterion for local belonging** by contrasting it with Putonghua and suggesting it lacks the same ""味道"" (flavor, cultural resonance).
  * This is not a critique of Putonghua per se, but a reflection of its symbolic distance from local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is clearly **endorsing the use of local language (Cantonese)** as a meaningful criterion for identifying ""local people.""
  * This is not a description of a general phenomenon or a neutral observation—it is a **value-laden statement** about linguistic authenticity and belonging.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This fits **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which includes the use of local dialects, accents, or cultural habits as a way to identify insiders vs. outsiders or to determine if someone is “one of us.”
  * The author is implying that speaking the local dialect (Cantonese) is a key part of being considered local or at least being socially integrated in a way that facilitates ""吹水"" (chatting, informal conversation).

**Output:** RL4"
我屋企坚持讲白话。虽然我个囡白话都唔多好，起码我哋坚持要距讲，无人迁就距，所以距一直都係同我哋用白话沟通。,** RL4," *   The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining the use of Cantonese (白话) at home, even though their daughter's Cantonese is not very good. They insist on speaking it with her and do not adjust or accommodate her preference for another language, indicating a strong belief in preserving linguistic identity as part of being ""local"" or maintaining local cultural identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""坚持讲白话"" (insist on speaking Cantonese) — relates to language use.
  *   ""个囡白话都唔多好"" (daughter's Cantonese is not very good) — implies language proficiency is not the key determinant.
  *   ""无人迁就距"" (no one accommodates her) — shows insistence on linguistic norm.
  *   ""一直都係同我哋用白话沟通"" (she always communicates with us in Cantonese) — reinforces the role of language in family and identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   Language is being used as a **criterion for cultural continuity and identity**. The author is not focused on convenience or fluency but on **preserving and transmitting a linguistic-cultural identity** within the family. This is not about administrative status, economic factors, or convenience — but about **belonging and local cultural identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses the use of Cantonese** as a standard for communication and identity within the family.
  *   This is not a critique of others’ practices or a description of general societal trends — it is a **deliberate, personal practice** rooted in **cultural-linguistic belonging**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This clearly matches **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author defines or reinforces a sense of ""local"" identity through the **use of the local dialect (Cantonese)**, regardless of fluency, and insists on maintaining it within the family.

**Output:** RL4"

This implies that **language ability (Cantonese)** is **not sufficient** to define someone as a ""local person"" — the author is **undermining the relevance or sufficiency of linguistic criteria** for defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text explicitly mentions **language ability** (""会讲白话"", speaking Cantonese) and uses it to **question its relevance** to local identity.
  *   It also implies that **origin (广西, 湖南)** or **regional background** is more important than language ability in determining local identity.
  *   No mention of administrative status, family history, territory perception, economic status, or occupation is present.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of ""会讲白话"" (speaking Cantonese) is used to **refute the idea** that language ability alone is enough to be considered local.
  *   The author is **resisting or dismissing** the **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** criterion, suggesting it's not a valid or exclusive marker of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** RL4 as a valid criterion for defining local identity.
  *   However, the **explicit discussion of language as a potential criterion** and the **author's rejection of it** means that **RL4 is functionally relevant** in the author's argument — it's being **challenged**, which still makes it a **part of the author's consideration** of what defines ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is **engaging with RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**, specifically to **question its sufficiency** as a standard for defining ""local"".
  *   Even though the author **does not endorse** it, the **discussion of linguistic ability as a potential identity marker** makes it a **relevant and active RL element** in the argument.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL4`"
我觉得唔紧要啊，起码人地真的学起来了，不是现在很多不友好的外地人，你一说白话，对方就一副妹仔大过主人婆的样子叫你讲普通话,** RL4," The author is expressing relief or approval that people are starting to learn Cantonese (""白话""), implying that this helps counter a perceived negative behavior from some non-locals who insist on Mandarin when hearing Cantonese, suggesting a sense of superiority (""妹仔大过主人婆"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The act of learning and using Cantonese (""学起来了"", ""说白话"") points to a linguistic behavior.
  - The contrast between those who are open to learning Cantonese and those who are not (""不友好的外地人"") implies a distinction between ""insiders"" and ""outsiders"".
  - The tone implies that speaking or being willing to learn Cantonese is a sign of respect or integration into the local community.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author sees willingness to learn and use Cantonese as a **marker of acceptable or integrated behavior**, contrasting with those who refuse to engage in local linguistic norms and instead impose Mandarin.
  - This implies that **language use (or willingness to adopt it)** is a **criterion for evaluating whether someone is considered a respectful or acceptable non-local**, or at least not hostile to local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **positively evaluates** people who ""learn and use Cantonese"", suggesting that **language proficiency or effort is a standard for judging whether someone respects or belongs to the local community**.
  - There is **no endorsement of territorial, administrative, economic, or occupational criteria**.
  - The **focus is on linguistic behavior as a marker of local integration or respect**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, where the author uses **language use or willingness to adopt local linguistic norms** as a **criterion for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable non-locals**, thus shaping the boundary of ""local identity"" by **linguistic inclusiveness or exclusion**.

**Output:** RL4"
祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的，跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系。你逻辑都搞不清楚,"**
RL3"," The author is making a strong assertion about what constitutes being a ""true"" local in Guangzhou — specifically, that having one's name in the ancestral hall (祠堂) is the fundamental criterion. This is not about administrative boundaries, cultural habits, or residency duration, but about **ancestral rootedness** and **family historical ties** to the place.

The author rejects the idea that cultural participation (e.g., visiting a local landmark like 陈家祠) or surface-level behaviors define local identity. Instead, they emphasize a **deep, genealogical connection** to the local area as the **core standard** for being considered a ""local"".

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is:
> ""祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的""

This clearly links the idea of being a ""Guangzhou person"" to having one's name in the ancestral hall — a **symbol of family historical rootedness**.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses the **ancestral hall naming tradition** to:
- Define who counts as a ""real"" local (Guangzhou person).
- Distinguish between superficial and authentic local identity.
- Emphasize **historical family ties** rather than current residency, cultural behavior, or administrative status.

This is not a resisted or neutral description — it is a **clear endorsement** of family historical rootedness as the **primary standard** for local identity.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Only one RL category clearly fits the author's endorsed logic:
- **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — because the author defines ""local people"" based on **family heritage and ancestral presence in the area**, not on current behavior, language, or legal status.

Other RLs like cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4) or administrative legitimacy (RL2) are **explicitly rejected** by the author.

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's statement aligns with **RL3**, where local identity is defined by **family history and ancestral recognition**, not by where you live now, what you do, or what you say. The ancestral hall (祠堂) is a symbolic and institutional recognition of this rootedness.

---

**Output:**
RL3"
陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,RL6," The author is expressing a viewpoint about **who counts as a ""local"" in a traditional village or community context**, particularly in relation to **village dividends and communal resources**. The sentence implies that if one receives dividends from the village (陈家祠), then they have a stake or connection to the local community; otherwise, they are not considered part of it.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is ""有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦"" — ""If you get dividends, it's your concern; if not, it's none of your business."" This points to a **social distinction based on access to community resources**, particularly **economic benefits tied to local identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  This phrase functions to **draw a boundary around who is considered a ""real local""** — those who have a material stake in the community (dividends) are insiders; others are outsiders. The author is **endorsing this distinction** rather than resisting it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  This clearly relates to **RL6**, which involves **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism**, particularly the **possession of community dividends** as a marker of authentic local identity and belonging.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is reinforcing a logic where **economic stake and social rootedness in the local community (via dividends)** define whether someone is considered a legitimate ""local person."" This is not about language, birthplace, or administrative status, but about **economic entitlement and symbolic belonging**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

They emphasize that their family has **disconnected from traditional clan structures**, even though there may be **historical links or shared surnames** with certain places or clans. The author seems to **reject the idea** that such traditional familial or clan ties should still serve as a strong basis for defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **Family historical links** – ""我阿公阿婆那边以前还算地主"", ""我阿爷和阿公姓氏和他们以前所在地方村子大姓相同""
  *   **Disconnection from ancestral traditions** – ""我们家早不搞这些了"", ""祠堂又不是我们家这边的"", ""拜山都都只拜到太公那代""
  *   **Critique of clan-based identity** – ""你话先人祖坟在都算了"", ""不是大宗族哪里来的祠堂，哪里来修族谱""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **family historical links** are mentioned not to affirm them, but to **contrast** with the present and to show that **historical ties alone are insufficient** to establish current local or clan identity.
  *   The **disconnection from ancestral traditions** is a **core argument**: the author is **rejecting the relevance** of such traditions in defining local identity today.
  *   The **critique of clan-based identity** further reinforces the author's view that **clan structures (and by extension, family historical rootedness) should not be the standard** for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** RL3 as a valid or current basis for defining local identity.
  *   The author is **explicitly distancing** their family from clan-based identity markers like祠堂 and族谱.
  *   Therefore, while RL3 is mentioned, it is **not endorsed** by the author as a valid criterion for defining ""local identity"" today.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although RL3 is referenced, it is **not affirmed** by the author but rather **questioned or dismissed**.
  *   The author's **core view** is that **family history or clan ties should not be the standard** for defining local identity in the modern era.
  *   Therefore, **no RL category is affirmed** by the author as a valid criterion.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: None"
错了，广州城系西至西门口，东至东山口，北至小北，南至南关，加上西关东山三元里河南四区。大部分有分红的村都唔系广州。,** RL1," The author is asserting a specific definition of ""Guangzhou"" (广州城) based on **traditional or conventional territorial boundaries** — both physical and conceptual — that distinguish what is considered truly ""local"" Guangzhou. The author explicitly excludes most villages with economic dividends from being part of ""Guangzhou,"" suggesting that administrative or economic factors alone do not define local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- The author defines ""Guangzhou"" using specific geographic landmarks: 西门口 (West Gate), 东山口 (East Mountain Gate), 小北 (Little North), 南关 (South Gate), and includes four districts: 西关, 东山, 三元里, 河南. These are **symbolic territorial markers**.
- The phrase “大部分有分红的村都唔系广州” (most villages with dividends are not Guangzhou) **rejects economic status or administrative village-level benefits as defining ""local"" identity**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The geographic boundaries are used to **exclude** certain areas (e.g., dividend villages) from being considered truly ""Guangzhou.""
- The author emphasizes **long-standing, socially recognized spatial boundaries** rather than legal/administrative or economic criteria.
- This suggests a **symbolic, conventional, and historically sedimented understanding of ""local"" territory**, not based on current administrative divisions or economic status.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **explicitly endorses** a **symbolically conventional territorial identity** (RL1).
- The author **rejects** economic status (RL6) or administrative village status as sufficient for defining ""local.""

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author's logic centers on a **socially conventional and historically rooted mental map** of Guangzhou, based on traditional spatial markers and shared symbolic boundaries.
- This logic **excludes** people or places merely based on economic benefits or administrative classifications.

Previously, locals were defined by living in the old urban areas, but now fluency in Cantonese is the main criterion. The author also critiques the idea that having ancestral roots (祠堂分红) and living in the old three districts (老三区) are necessary to be considered a ""true local,"" suggesting that this standard is both exclusionary and unrealistic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “会粤语都当你广州人” → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**
  - “祠堂分红” (ancestral temple dividends) → **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**
  - “老三区” (old three districts) → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**
  - Implicit contrast between old and new standards for being considered a local → **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** may be involved but not explicitly endorsed

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL4** is used by the author as the **current, more inclusive standard** for being considered a local — speaking Cantonese is sufficient.
  - **RL6 (祠堂分红)** and **RL1 (老三区)** are **critiqued** by the author as **unrealistic and exclusionary standards** — the author implies they are **not legitimate** criteria in the modern context.
  - Therefore, although these elements are mentioned, only **RL4** is **endorsed** by the author as a valid criterion for defining ""local identity"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is the **only criterion** the author **explicitly endorses** as the current standard for being considered a local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author argues that **speaking Cantonese** is now the main way to be accepted as a ""local"" in Guangzhou, contrasting with older, more exclusionary standards such as ancestral roots or living in specific traditional urban districts. These older standards are **not supported** by the author and are presented as **outdated or unrealistic**.

They are questioning why some people use these criteria to identify ""true locals"", implying that they themselves **do not fully endorse** this logic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""分红"" (dividends) and ""祠堂"" (ancestral hall) — these point to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as they are often indicators of deep-rooted local identity tied to village collectives and economic entitlements.
  *   The mention of the friend being from a village in Chigang and originally from Sanshui hints at **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** and possibly **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, but these are not used by the author as **criteria they personally endorse** — rather, they are used to set up the contrast with the ""dividends and ancestral halls"" logic.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of ""分红又祠堂"" is used to **highlight a standard that others apply**, which the author finds questionable or insufficient as a definition of ""local identity"".
  *   The author does **not affirm** this standard but rather **casts doubt** on it, suggesting they **do not endorse** RL6 as a valid or sufficient criterion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not affirming any specific RL category** as their own standard for defining ""local identity"".
  *   They are **questioning** the use of RL6 criteria by others, but not replacing it with an alternative they personally endorse.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text **does not contain any RL criteria that the author explicitly or implicitly endorses** as their own logic for defining ""local identity"".

They assert their deep connection to Guangzhou through family history, hukou (ID number 4401), language (Cantonese), place of residence (village), and participation in local benefits (dividends). However, they are excluded based on the lack of a clan ancestral hall (祠堂), which they sarcastically accept, concluding that their entire village must be ""non-local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Family history in Guangzhou for several generations → possibly **RL3**
  - ID number starting with 4401 → **RL2**
  - Speaking Cantonese → **RL4**
  - Living in a village with dividends → **RL6**
  - Lack of ancestral hall (祠堂) used as a criterion for exclusion → possibly **RL1** or **RL7**, but more symbolic boundary setting

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Family history:** Used to assert legitimacy as a ""local person"" → **endorsed**
  - **Hukou (ID number):** Used to assert administrative legitimacy as a local → **endorsed**
  - **Language (Cantonese):** Used to assert cultural belonging → **endorsed**
  - **Village residence with dividends:** Used to assert rootedness and participation in local economic structure → **endorsed**
  - **Lack of ancestral hall:** Used by others to exclude → **not endorsed** by the author, but rather **resisted** through irony

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author endorses **family rootedness**, **administrative legitimacy**, **cultural-linguistic recognition**, and **social-economic rootedness** as valid criteria for being considered a local.
  - The **lack of ancestral hall** is not endorsed by the author but is used to highlight the absurdity of arbitrary exclusion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** ID number 4401 is cited as a marker of local belonging.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The author asserts that their family has lived in Guangzhou for generations.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Cantonese is spoken as a cultural marker of local identity.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** Living in a village with dividends indicates social and economic integration.

土生土长怎么就不是本地人了，我刚满月就随父母来广州定居，在广州长大几十年，我也很自豪地是说自己是广州人,RL3," * The author is expressing a strong sense of local identity, asserting that despite not being born in Guangzhou, having lived there since infancy and grown up in the city qualifies them to proudly identify as a ""Guangzhou person"". The core argument is that **long-term upbringing in a place should qualify someone as ""local""**, countering the idea that only being ""native-born"" counts.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""土生土长"" (native-born) — this is **contrasted** by the author, not endorsed as a criterion.
  * ""刚满月就随父母来广州定居"" (settled in Guangzhou when just a month old) — implies **early settlement and long-term residence**, which supports **RL3**.
  * ""在广州长大几十年"" (grew up in Guangzhou for decades) — again supports **RL3**.
  * ""我很自豪地是说自己是广州人"" (proudly call myself a Guangzhou person) — indicates a **claim to local identity**, supported by the above points.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  * The author is **rejecting RL3 as the sole criterion** (i.e., being ""native-born"") but is **endorsing long-term upbringing and settlement in the city as sufficient for local identity**, which aligns with **RL3's broader interpretation** (growth history and early settlement).
  * The author does **not** endorse **RL1 (territorial identity)**, **RL2 (administrative legitimacy)**, **RL4 (linguistic/cultural)**, **RL5 (livability)**, **RL6 (social roots)**, or **RL7 (occupation)** as the basis of their identity claim.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly uses **growing up in Guangzhou from early childhood and long-term settlement** as the **basis for claiming local identity**, which fits the **RL3** framework.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is advocating that **being raised in a place from early childhood**, even if not born there, is sufficient to claim local identity. This aligns with the **RL3** category, which emphasizes **individual growth history** as a foundation for local identity.

在广州三代以内上就算真正广州人，二代以内是新广州人，一代开荒牛是广州移民，三代都不讲广州话的是外省广州人（祖宗是捞佬）来广州的。,"** RL3, RL4"," The author is proposing a classification system for defining who counts as a ""real"" Guangzhou native, a ""new"" Guangzhou person, or an outsider. This classification is based on generational depth of presence in Guangzhou and the maintenance of the local language (Cantonese). The author is clearly linking generational rootedness and cultural-linguistic continuity to the legitimacy of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “三代以内就算真正广州人” (three generations or fewer in Guangzhou counts as a real Guangzhou person) → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - “二代以内是新广州人” (two generations or fewer makes one a ""new"" Guangzhou person) → RL3
  - “一代开荒牛是广州移民” (first-generation migrants are pioneers or immigrants) → RL3
  - “三代都不讲广州话的是外省广州人” (even if three generations, not speaking Cantonese makes one an outsider Guangzhou person) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - “祖宗是捞佬” (ancestors are from other provinces) → RL3

**Step 3: Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements**
  - The generational distinction (RL3) is used to establish a **hierarchy of local identity**, where deeper historical roots equate to more authentic local status.
  - The mention of language (RL4) is used to **distinguish between insiders and outsiders**, even when generational rootedness is present. It acts as a **filter or gatekeeping mechanism** for what counts as ""true"" local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL3** as the main axis of classification and **RL4** as a critical qualifier. These are not just descriptive but **normative**—they are used to judge who belongs and who does not.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **family rootedness (RL3)** to define the generational hierarchy of local identity.
  - The author uses **language (RL4)** as a key marker of cultural belonging, even overriding generational rootedness in some cases.

我爸广州天河本地的 但是当时我妈老家有分红 把我户口跟妈妈了 那我也不算广州的 我爸总说 你就是广州的所以我是不是广州本地的啊（说的一口流利粤语 从小就在广州长大）,"** RL3, RL4"," The author is expressing confusion and a sense of contradiction regarding their local identity in the context of Guangzhou. Despite being born and raised there, speaking fluent Cantonese, and having a parent who is a local, the author's household registration (hukou) is tied to their mother's hometown due to economic benefits (dividends). This creates a conflict between administrative identity and cultural/familial rootedness.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - *户口跟妈妈了* — RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)
  - *我爸广州天河本地的* — RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)

  - *你就是广州的* — RL3/RL4 (Implicit认同 of rootedness and cultural belonging)
  - *分红* — RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (户口跟妈妈了):** Functions to explain the administrative reason why the author is not officially recognized as a local. The author seems to resist this as the sole criterion.
  - **RL3 (Family and upbringing):** Used by the author (and their father) to argue for a deeper, more authentic local identity. Strongly endorsed.
  - **RL4 (Speaking fluent粤语):** Implicitly used to support the idea of cultural belonging and local identity. Strongly endorsed.
  - **RL6 (分红):** Used to explain the economic motivation behind the hukou decision, but not directly used by the author to define local identity. Rather, it serves as a contrast to the more meaningful criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL2:** Not endorsed as the main criterion — rather, it is the source of the author's identity dilemma.
  - **RL3:** Strongly endorsed — the author emphasizes growing up in Guangzhou and having a local parent.
  - **RL4:** Strongly endorsed — fluency in the local language is used as evidence of belonging.
  - **RL6:** Not endorsed as a defining feature of local identity — used more to explain the background of the situation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs their argument around the idea that **growing up in a place (RL3)** and **cultural fluency (RL4)** are the most important markers of being a local, rather than administrative status (RL2) or economic benefits (RL6). The author implicitly resists the idea that hukou alone defines local identity.

首先你会讲白话吗？,** RL4," The author's core expressive intent is to ask if I speak Cantonese (or ""Hokkien"" depending on context), which implies a belief that speaking the local dialect is relevant to being considered ""local"" or being accepted as part of the local community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “你会讲白话吗?” (Do you speak Cantonese/Hokkien?). This relates to language and communication, which are central to cultural-linguistic identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The question functions as a **test or criterion** for local identity — the author implies that **speaking the local dialect is a prerequisite for communication or belonging** in the local context.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **endorsing the idea** that speaking the local dialect (白话) is important — possibly even essential — for being considered a local or being accepted in the local setting.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This fits clearly under **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it uses language (specifically, speaking the local dialect) as a **criterion for identifying local identity or local affiliation**.

  *   - “老广（老广指村里有分红的）” (old Guang refers to those who receive village dividends) → **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**
  *   - “新广就是买房定居广州（新入户广州的）” (new Guang are those who bought property and settled in Guangzhou, newly registered residents) → **RL6** (property ownership as a sign of local integration), and possibly **RL2** (new hukou registration)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author uses **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as the **baseline** for defining who is officially a Guangzhou resident.
  *   They then **add layers of local identity authenticity** by introducing **RL6 (village dividends and property ownership)** — indicating that just having a hukou isn't enough to be considered a ""true local"" (老广).
  *   These RL elements are **endorsed and used by the author** to **construct a hierarchy of local identity**, distinguishing between ""official residents"", ""established locals"", and ""newcomers"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **clearly endorses**:
      *   **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — hukou is the basic marker of being a resident.
      *   **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** — village dividends and property ownership are used to distinguish deeper local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as the **basic threshold** for being considered a ""Guangzhou person"". However, they **further refine** this identity using **social and economic rootedness** (RL6), distinguishing between those who are simply registered (户口) and those who have **deeper ties through dividends or property**. This implies a **multi-layered understanding of ""local"" identity**, where **legal status is necessary but not sufficient**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL2, RL6"
错了，广州城系西至西门口，东至东山口，北至小北，南至南关，加上西关东山三元里河南四区。大部分有分红的村都唔系广州。,RL1," The author is asserting a specific definition of ""Guangzhou"" (广州城) based on **traditional or socially conventional boundaries** — not just administratively or legally, but based on long-standing regional cognition and identity perception. They are **excluding most villages with dividends** from being considered truly ""Guangzhou,"" implying that economic benefits or administrative status do not define local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The text defines the scope of ""Guangzhou"" with specific directional markers (西门口, 东山口, 小北, 南关) and adds specific named districts (西关, 东山, 三元里, 河南四区), indicating a **traditional or socially accepted mental map** of the city — this points to **RL1**.
  - The author **excludes most dividend-paying villages** from being considered part of ""Guangzhou,"" implying that **administrative benefits or economic status (RL6)** are **not sufficient** to define local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 element** directly supports the author's main argument: defining the ""true"" or ""core"" Guangzhou based on historical and socially accepted boundaries.
  - The **exclusion of dividend villages** serves to **refute** the idea that administrative legitimacy (RL2) or economic status (RL6) should be used to define ""local.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL1** is **explicitly endorsed** by the author as a standard to define ""local.""
  - RL2 and RL6 are **resisted** and thus **not annotated**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL1** to assert a socially conventional understanding of the ""true"" Guangzhou, based on traditional mental maps and historical regional identity.
  - This definition is used to **exclude** areas that may have administrative or economic ties to Guangzhou but lack the **symbolic or socially conventional legitimacy** of being ""local.""

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL1"
边个话你知老广就有分红，有分红都是村镇的，老广是住市区的,** RL1," The author is making a distinction between two groups traditionally considered ""老广"" (old Cantonese/local Guangzhou residents): one group receives **village/township dividends**, implying rural or suburban registered residence status, while the **true ""老广""** are those who **live in the urban core**. The author is thus constructing a **hierarchy of local identity**, where **urban residency is a more authentic or core form of being ""local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老广"" — Refers to long-standing local residents in Guangzhou.
  - ""分红"" — Indicates economic benefits typically associated with rural or village-level collective ownership.
  - ""村镇的"" — Refers to rural or township areas.
  - ""市区的"" — Refers to urban core areas.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of **""分红"" and ""村镇的""** is used to **distinguish** a **less authentic or peripheral form of local identity**, based on economic status and rural registration.
  - The mention of **""市区的""** is used to **positively affirm** that **true ""老广"" status belongs to those in the urban core**, implying a **hierarchy of local identity** based on **residential location** and **urban centrality**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **rejects the idea** that receiving **village dividends** (RL6) equates to being **authentically local**.
  - The author **affirms** that **living in the urban core** (RL1) is a **key criterion** for being **truly ""local""**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
    The author uses the **urban core vs. rural/urban periphery** distinction to define who counts as ""老广"", affirming that **urban residency is central to authentic local identity**.
  - **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**
    The author **negates** the idea that **village dividends** (a form of rural economic benefit) are a valid marker of being **truly ""local""**, thus **excluding this criterion** from their definition.

**Output:** RL1"
我是爷爷南下干部过来的，虽然白话习惯都一样，但内心里没有归属感,** RL1," The author is expressing a sense of **lack of local identity or belonging** despite having lived in the area long enough to adopt local habits and language. The core intent is to convey that **growing up in a place and adopting its cultural-linguistic traits does not necessarily equate to feeling “local”**, especially when there is no deep emotional or psychological connection.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""爷爷南下干部过来的"" (My grandfather was a cadre who came south) → suggests **family historical rootedness** (RL3), indicating a migration background.
  - ""白话习惯都一样"" (Speak the same dialect and have the same habits) → points to **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4).
  - ""内心里没有归属感"" (No inner sense of belonging) → implies that **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1) is not felt or experienced, even with surface-level integration.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness): The author's family history of migration plays a background role in explaining why they feel disconnected from the local identity, even after adopting local traits.
  - RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition): While the author has adopted the local language and customs, they emphasize that this **alone is not sufficient** to create a sense of local belonging.
  - RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity): The author is implicitly contrasting the **external perception of being local** (due to language and habits) with the **internal lack of belonging**, suggesting that **local identity is more psychological than behavioral**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** RL4 as a sufficient criterion for local identity, even though they possess it.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** RL1 as a **necessary condition**—that is, without a psychological sense of belonging, one cannot truly feel “local”.
  - RL3 is used to explain the background but **not framed as a defining criterion** of local identity by the author.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author is making a **distinction between surface-level integration (RL4)** and **deeper psychological identification (RL1)**. They imply that **true local identity requires the latter**, not just the former.
  - Therefore, the author **implicitly endorses RL1** as the **real marker of local identity**, while **RL4 is not sufficient**.

**Output:** RL1"
是不是本地人对你来说有啥本质区别吗，反正你又没分红,RL6," The author is questioning the significance of being a ""local person"" (本地人), implying that **simply being labeled as such doesn't inherently grant real, tangible benefits** — specifically, they point out the lack of **dividends** (""你又没分红"") as evidence that being a ""local"" may not equate to having real local advantages or rootedness.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “你又没分红” (""you don't get dividends""), which points to **community dividends**, a concept strongly tied to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**. The author is suggesting that **just claiming to be a local or being registered as one is insufficient** — what matters is whether one **receives economic benefits (e.g., dividends) from the community**, which indicates real social or economic rootedness.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase “你又没分红” functions as a **challenge to a conventional assumption** — that being a ""local"" inherently means having access to certain benefits or rootedness. The author implies that **true local identity or belonging should be measured not by administrative status or cultural traits, but by real economic or social integration**, such as receiving dividends from the community.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **endorsing the idea that real local identity should be judged by whether one receives community dividends**, not just by cultural, linguistic, or administrative definitions. Therefore, this qualifies under **RL6**, as it directly ties **economic status and social rootedness** to the **definition of ""local"" identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is suggesting that **being a ""local"" without receiving dividends means one lacks real economic or social rootedness**, thus implying that **dividends are a valid criterion for judging authentic local identity**. This aligns precisely with **RL6**, which includes **community dividends, real estate ownership, and economic status** as markers of **authentic, rooted local identity**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: `RL6`"
想是就是，看自己的归属感,(None)," * The author is expressing that being ""local"" is primarily a matter of **self-perception and personal sense of belonging** — ""想是就是，看自己的归属感"" roughly translates to ""If you think you are, then you are — it depends on your own sense of belonging.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase is **""归属感"" (sense of belonging)**, which implies a subjective, internalized criterion for defining local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase **""归属感"" (sense of belonging)** plays a **central role** in the author’s argument. It is **explicitly endorsed** as the **main standard** for determining whether someone is considered ""local"".
  * The author is **not** referring to objective or external criteria such as geography, administrative status, family history, or cultural traits. Instead, they are emphasizing a **personal, psychological identification** with a place.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The only relevant RL category that aligns with **self-defined, internalized belonging** is **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, **but only if** the sense of belonging is tied to **a socially recognized regional identity or mental map**.
  * In this case, the author is not anchoring the sense of belonging to any specific region, cultural identity, or administrative unit. They are instead proposing a **purely subjective, individual-based definition**, which is **not directly covered** by any RL category — because RL focuses on **socially or structurally grounded criteria**, not purely individual perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * While the author emphasizes **belonging**, the lack of any reference to **territorial, cultural, administrative, or historical anchors** means that the statement falls **outside the scope of the RL framework**.
  * The RL framework requires that the author is using or endorsing **some socially or structurally grounded logic** to define ""local"" — this text does not do that.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: (None)"
算啦，是不是本地的重要吗？ 现在粤语都没人讲了，分红也只有村民有,"** RL4, RL6"," The author is expressing a resigned attitude toward the diminishing significance of being ""local"" — noting that even cultural identity markers like粤语 (Cantonese) are fading, and only certain people (villagers) still receive economic benefits like分红 (dividends). The underlying point is that traditional markers of local identity — cultural and economic — are eroding, hence questioning the relevance of ""local identity"" today.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""粤语都没人讲了"" — relates to **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**, as it refers to the decline of a local language.
  - ""分红也只有村民有"" — relates to **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**, as it refers to economic benefits tied to local status (village affiliation).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL4 element (""粤语都没人讲了"")** plays the role of indicating that a traditional cultural marker of local identity is fading, suggesting that the cultural basis for distinguishing locals is disappearing.
  - **RL6 element (""分红也只有村民有"")** implies that only a specific group (villagers) retains economic privileges tied to local status, which could once be used to define who is ""truly local"", but now seems limited or outdated.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Both elements are used by the author to suggest that traditional bases for defining ""local identity"" — cultural fluency and economic rootedness — are either fading or restricted, thus questioning the continued relevance or coherence of the concept of ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4** is clearly referenced through the mention of language decline, which the author implies undermines a key cultural boundary of local identity.
  - **RL6** is referenced through the mention of economic dividends being exclusive to villagers, which the author seems to imply is one of the few remaining material distinctions of local status.

**Output:** RL4, RL6"
你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。,"**  
RL6"," The author is expressing a viewpoint that having access to community dividends (村分红 / 社区分红) is a key indicator or criterion for determining whether someone is truly considered a ""local"" or not. The phrase ""you have dividends, you are; you don't have dividends, you might not be"" strongly implies that this economic benefit is a **symbol of rootedness and local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is: **“你有分红就是，没分红就…有概率不是。”**
  - This centers around **dividends**, which are often distributed in urban villages or rural collectives to original residents or those with deep local ties.
  - This clearly relates to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as it involves **community dividends**, which are tied to **local resource control**, **social rootedness**, and **economic status symbolism**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of dividends is not just a passing observation; it is the **core standard** the author is proposing for determining local identity.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** this as a **legitimate or commonly accepted criterion** for defining who counts as a local person.
  - The phrase implies a **hierarchy or boundary** of local identity based on access to these dividends, which are often tied to lineage, land ownership, and long-standing social roots.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly uses the presence or absence of community dividends** as a **criterion for defining local identity**.
  - This aligns with **RL6**, which involves **community dividends**, **social rootedness**, and **economic status** as markers of local identity.
  - There is no indication that the author resists this standard; rather, it is presented as a **taken-for-granted or legitimate standard**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The statement directly maps to **RL6**, as it uses **dividends**—a key indicator of local resource access and social rootedness—as the **basis for defining local identity**.
  - The author suggests that **dividend access is a functional and accepted marker** of being considered a ""real local"".

作为广州土生土长的家族第三代一直自我认同喺广州本地土著 直到有祠堂的本地村民话我唔喺土著先动摇咗我嘅概念认知 毕竟阿爷个代先出来广州搵食定居 户口本依然显示乡下地名而唔喺广州 确实又好似无力反驳,"** RL2, RL3, RL6"," The author is expressing a personal identity crisis regarding their self-perceived status as a ""local"" in Guangzhou. They had always considered themselves a local—being the third generation of their family born and raised there—but this belief was challenged by villagers with ancestral祠堂s (ancestral halls), who implied that the author is not truly a local. The author then reflects on the fact that their grandfather was the first to move to Guangzhou for work, and their household registration (hukou) still reflects a rural origin, not Guangzhou itself. This undermines the author's confidence in their ""local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - *Family historical rootedness*: ""家族第三代"" (third generation of the family), ""阿爷个代先出来广州搵食定居"" (grandfather was the first to come to Guangzhou to make a living and settle down) → RL3.
  - *Administrative legitimacy*: ""户口本依然显示乡下地名而唔喺广州"" (the hukou book still shows a rural address, not Guangzhou) → RL2.
  - *Socially conventional territorial identity / Cultural-linguistic recognition*: ""自我认同喺广州本地土著"" (self-identify as a local native of Guangzhou) → possibly RL1 or RL4.
  - *Depth of social roots & economic status symbolism*: ""有祠堂的本地村民"" (local villagers who have ancestral halls) → RL6 (ancestral halls often symbolize deep social and ancestral roots, and are markers of traditional local identity).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** The author uses their family's multigenerational presence in Guangzhou to support their self-identification as a local. This is central to their original identity construction.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The hukou discrepancy is used by the author as a counterpoint to their self-identification, indicating that they recognize administrative legitimacy as a criterion others may use (and possibly themselves begin to accept).
  - **RL1/RL4 (Social/Cultural Identity):** The author’s self-identification as a ""土著"" (native/local) implies a cultural and territorial sense of belonging, though it's not explicitly tied to dialect or customs, so RL4 is less certain.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots):** The mention of villagers with ancestral halls implies a contrast in depth of roots—those with祠堂 are seen as more ""authentically"" local, suggesting the author implicitly accepts this as a criterion for local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly accepts** RL2 (hukou) and RL6 (ancestral halls as markers of deep roots) as criteria for defining ""local"" identity, even if they feel conflicted.
  - The author **explicitly uses** RL3 (family history) as the basis of their original self-identification.
  - The author **does not clearly endorse** RL4 or RL1 with sufficient specificity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs a narrative of local identity based on **family rootedness (RL3)**, but this is challenged by **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** and **depth of social roots (RL6)**, which the author begins to accept as valid criteria for determining ""true local"" status. This leads to an identity crisis and self-doubt.

**Output:** RL2, RL3, RL6"
这样算的话就没有多少广州人了，以前广州城很小的，只要你认可广州文化会讲广州话就是广州人了，别说有分红的才叫广州人，很多市区的广州人都没有分红，祖籍都是广州周边城市，但是三代在广州了,"RL1, RL3, RL4"," The author is arguing that being a ""Guangzhou person"" (广州人) should not be defined narrowly by administrative boundaries, household registration, or economic benefits like village dividends. Instead, they propose that cultural认同 (认同广州文化) and linguistic fluency (会讲广州话) are more essential to local identity. They also mention that many people who have lived in Guangzhou for three generations and are now part of the urban core still have ancestral roots in surrounding cities, reinforcing the idea that identity should be based on long-term cultural integration rather than formal or economic status.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""以前广州城很小的""** – implies a historical and conventional understanding of the city’s territorial identity.
  - **""只要你认可广州文化会讲广州话就是广州人了""** – clearly ties cultural-linguistic recognition to local identity.
  - **""别说有分红的才叫广州人""** – rejects the idea that economic or social rootedness (like village dividends) defines local identity.
  - **""很多市区的广州人都没有分红""** – further rejects RL6 as a defining standard.
  - **""祖籍都是广州周边城市，但是三代在广州了""** – supports the idea of rootedness through multi-generational presence in the city, not just ancestral origin.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Used to contrast past and present understandings of Guangzhou’s boundaries, suggesting that the traditional, smaller city concept is outdated.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Central to the author's argument – being a Guangzhou person is defined by cultural认同 and speaking Cantonese.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author supports this as a valid criterion – being in Guangzhou for three generations is seen as sufficient for local identity.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** Explicitly rejected – the author argues against using dividends or economic ties as a standard for being considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **Endorsed:**
    - RL1: Implied conventional understanding of Guangzhou’s evolving territorial identity.
    - RL3: Multi-generational presence in Guangzhou.
    - RL4: Cultural认同 and language.
  - **Not Endorsed / Rejected:**
    - RL6: Economic benefits like dividends are explicitly rejected as criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author argues that being a ""Guangzhou person"" is not about economic or administrative status, but rather about cultural认同, linguistic fluency, and multi-generational presence. They also imply that the conventional understanding of Guangzhou’s boundaries and identity has changed over time. These elements collectively support a more inclusive and culturally grounded definition of local identity.

They also share their own background: though originally from Maoming, they have grown up in Guangzhou, with family ties and life experiences rooted in Guangzhou (especially番禺), and do not feel any identification with Maoming. The last sentence suggests番禺’s identity or administrative affiliation might be contested or evolving.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""户口在广州"" → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)
  - ""会讲白话"" → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - ""有文化认同"" → possibly RL4 or RL1; here, more about认同 than historical regional identity → RL4
  - ""祖籍茂名"" → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)
  - ""祖上因为打地主走过来"" → RL3 (migration history)
  - ""阿爷係华师学生，后来喺番禺起屋做老师"" → RL3 (family rooted in Guangzhou area)
  - ""我屋企而家已经同茂名那边几乎冇关系，一个人都唔识"" → RL3 (lack of current ties to ancestral place, used to reject ancestral identity)
  - ""我唔觉得我係第二个地方嘅人"" → rejection of identity based on祖籍 → supports RL2/RL4 as the author’s endorsed criteria
  - ""至于番禺嘅归属，那是另一个话题"" → implies番禺’s identity or administrative affiliation is ambiguous or contested → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL2 (""户口在广州"") is presented as a **core criterion** for being considered a local.
  - RL4 (""会讲白话"", ""文化认同"") is also **explicitly endorsed** as part of what makes someone a local.
  - RL3 (""祖籍茂名"", etc.) is used to **reject ancestral ties as a valid criterion** for local identity.
  - RL1 (""番禺嘅归属"") is **not directly defining the speaker’s identity**, but it reflects a broader **territorial ambiguity or evolving perception**, which is part of the author’s awareness and possibly their implicit argument that番禺 is or should be seen as part of Guangzhou.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** RL2 and RL4 as the criteria for being a Guangzhou person.
  - The author **implicitly endorses** RL1 through the mention of番禺’s ambiguous identity, suggesting that **social or conventional perceptions of territory matter** in defining local identity.
  - RL3 is used to **reject ancestral ties**, so it is not part of the endorsed criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that people should be considered locals if they have **Guangzhou hukou (RL2)** and **speak Cantonese with cultural认同 (RL4)**.
  - The author also shows awareness that **the perception of番禺’s identity is fluid or contested**, indicating a sensitivity to **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)**.
  - Ancestral origin (RL3) is explicitly **rejected** as a valid criterion.

They affirm their sense of being a local based on **family rootedness** and **birthplace**, but feel excluded due to lacking **administrative recognition** and **social-economic markers** like land or property.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “我妈果边是世代广州人” – indicates **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness)
  - “我爷在广州出世” – also supports **RL3**
  - “我觉得我系” – indicates a **personal认同** of being a local
  - “但我无分红无地无屋” – implies lack of **RL6** markers (social-economic status, property, dividends)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - **RL3** elements (family rootedness, birthplace) are used to **support the author's claim of being a local**.
  - **RL6** elements (land, dividends, property) are **missing**, and the author feels **excluded** from full local status because of this.
  - The author **does not resist** these criteria but feels **denied recognition** due to lacking them.

  - The author **explicitly endorses RL3** as a basis for local identity (family history, birthplace).
  - The author **implicitly acknowledges RL6** as a **socially accepted standard** for full local status, even though they are excluded from it.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is clearly endorsed through the author's reference to generational rootedness and birthplace.

有没有祠堂？有没有地？有没有分红？,"RL3, RL6"," The author is asking a series of questions that revolve around the idea of **local belonging or rootedness** in a community. Specifically, they are **seeking to determine whether someone has deep, traditional, and material ties to the local area**, which would qualify them as a ""local person"" in a more authentic or recognized sense.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “有没有祠堂？” (Do you have an ancestral hall?) — points to **family historical rootedness**, possibly indicating multi-generational presence and cultural continuity.
  - “有没有地？” (Do you have land?) — suggests **ownership of local property**, indicating deep social and economic roots.
  - “有没有分红？” (Do you receive dividends?) — refers to **participation in local community resources or economic benefits**, often reserved for recognized locals or villagers.

These elements point to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**, **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**, and potentially **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** if ""dividends"" are tied to administrative status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These questions function as **criteria to distinguish between people who are considered ""genuine locals"" and those who are not**.
  - The author implies that **simply living in the area is not enough**; one must have **historical, material, and institutional ties** to be truly recognized as local.
  - The tone suggests that these are **standards the author either endorses or observes as legitimate within the community**.

The author seems to be **questioning whether these factors truly qualify them as ""local""**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “身份证唔系44010” – ID card prefix not belonging to Guangzhou → **RL2**
- “要先入阿妈度” – must first register under the mother’s hukou → **RL2**
- “住祖屋宅基地” – living in ancestral home/宅基地 (ancestral land) → **RL3**
- “老豆打啊爷工，要转居民” – father worked for grandfather's collective, had to convert to urban household → **RL2 / RL6**
- “条村年年爬龙船...玩船头旗位...啊嘛挂左罗左D死股” – participation in dragon boat culture, flags, and shares → **RL4 / RL6**
- “有村，冇分红” – part of the village but no dividends → **RL6**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The **RL2** elements (ID card, hukou transfer) are used to **highlight institutional barriers** to being recognized as ""local"", which the author seems to **implicitly critique**.
- The **RL3** element (祖屋宅基地) serves to **assert deep historical and familial roots**, which the author uses to **argue for their local identity**.
- The **RL4/RL6** elements (dragon boat customs, flag positions, shares) are used to **demonstrate cultural and social integration**, further **supporting the claim of being local**.
- The **RL6** element (no dividends) is used to **contrast lived experience with institutional recognition**, showing that **economic benefits do not define local identity** for the author.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **supports** the idea that **family historical rootedness (RL3)** and **cultural participation (RL4)** are valid markers of local identity.
- The author **critiques the administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as insufficient or misleading.
- The **lack of dividends (RL6)** is used to **highlight the disconnect between economic status and identity**, not to endorse it as a criterion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author **asserts that deep family history (RL3)** and **cultural integration (RL4)** are **central to local identity**, while **questioning the validity of administrative definitions (RL2)** and **economic participation (RL6)**.
- The **core argument is that local identity is rooted in history and culture**, not in legal status or economic benefit.

对啊我也想知道我们家在从化的村里有个几百年的祠堂，肯定算从化土著了。但是一几年并入广州之后身份证变了，不知道算不算广州土著。,"**

RL3, RL2"," The author is expressing uncertainty about their ""local identity"" status after an administrative change. They are trying to assert their deep historical and familial roots in a place (from generations of family history and ancestral祠堂), but are now questioning whether that identity changes due to the area being incorporated into a larger city (Guangzhou) and the subsequent change in hukou (household registration reflected on ID cards). The author is implicitly trying to determine what makes someone a “native” or “local” of a place—historical rootedness or administrative classification.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “我们家在从化的村里有个几百年的祠堂” → strongly implies **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness)
  - “一几年并入广州之后身份证变了” → implies **RL2** (Administrative Legitimacy)
  - “不知道算不算广州土著” → core question revolves around defining “local identity” and whether it shifts with administrative boundaries → reinforces both **RL2** and **RL3**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **hundreds-of-years-old ancestral hall** is used by the author as a **strong indicator of deep-rooted family history**, implying that they believe this should qualify them as “local” in some sense.
  - The **administrative change and ID card change** are presented as **conflicting factors** that might override the rootedness, indicating that the author is aware of and somewhat influenced by the **administrative definition of local identity**.
  - The author is **uncertain** but **leans toward valuing rootedness**, yet is **open to or concerned about the administrative legitimacy standard**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly values family historical rootedness** (RL3) as a basis for claiming local identity.
  - The author **acknowledges administrative legitimacy** (RL2) as a potentially valid or at least influential standard, even if not fully endorsed.
  - There is **no clear rejection** of either standard, and both are **used in the author’s internal debate about local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is the author’s **primary basis for claiming local identity**, based on ancestral presence and祠堂.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is **not rejected** and is explicitly **considered as a possible override**, indicating that the author **implicitly accepts it as a relevant standard** for defining local identity.

这么说吧，广州前段时间村里分分红，你家有吗？没就不算,RL6," The author is asserting that whether someone's family received a village dividend is a key criterion for determining whether they are considered a ""local"" person. The implication is that only those who are deeply rooted in the local community—such as through village collective benefits—are truly seen as locals.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase “你家有分红吗？没就不算” (Did your family get a dividend? If not, then you're not considered local) directly links economic benefits tied to local collective ownership and community ties to the definition of ""local identity.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The idea of receiving a village dividend is not just about economic benefit—it symbolizes deep-rooted social integration and belonging to the local community. The author is using this as a **criterion to exclude** those who are not part of the traditional local social structure.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that receiving a village dividend is a valid and important standard for defining who is a local. This is a clear endorsement of a **socially rooted, economic-based** criterion for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, as the author uses the presence of village dividends—linked to local community ties and economic stake—as a **defining marker** of local identity.

我住德政中，无村无分红,RL6," *   The author is making a brief statement about where they live — ""德政中"" (middle section of Dezheng, likely a street or district), and clarifies that they are **not part of a village community** and **do not receive dividends**. This implies a contrast between village-based locals (who may receive community dividends) and non-village residents like the author.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""无村无分红"" — **lack of village affiliation and lack of dividends**.
  *   This points to a **distinction in local identity based on village membership and economic entitlement**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase ""无村无分红"" functions to **distinguish the speaker from a certain category of local people** — those who are affiliated with a village and benefit from its economic structure.
  *   The author is **not resisting** this criterion; rather, they are **acknowledging its existence** as a standard used in defining ""local"" identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not explicitly defining what ""local"" should be — but they are **implicitly acknowledging** that **village affiliation and dividends** are criteria used by others (or in society) to distinguish locals from non-locals.
  *   However, the author is **not endorsing** this as their own belief — they are **describing a social reality** that they do not fit into.
  *   Therefore, the **author is not using this logic themselves** to define ""local"", but **acknowledging its presence in society**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This aligns with **RL6**, which involves **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism** — specifically, **village dividends** and **community resource access** as markers of local identity or rootedness.
  *   Although the author does not personally endorse this as a valid criterion, the statement implies that **this is a commonly used standard**, and the author is **excluding themselves from that category**.

只有广州农村人才算广州人吗我们公司主管是土生土长的广州人，但是一直住在靠近市区，家里也没有分红,RL3," *   The author is questioning the idea that only rural residents are considered ""true locals"" (广州人) in Guangzhou, using their supervisor as a counterexample — someone who is native-born (土生土长的广州人) and lives near the city center, but who does not receive rural community dividends.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - “土生土长的广州人” → indicates birth and upbringing in Guangzhou → potentially RL3.
  *   - “家里也没有分红” → implies the absence of traditional rural community benefits → potentially contrasting RL6.
  *   - Implicit contrast between rural and urban Guangzhou → potentially RL1.
  *   - The question implies a critique of using rural identity as a standard for being a ""true local"" → the author resists RL6 and possibly RL1 criteria.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - The phrase “土生土长的广州人” is used to affirmatively establish that the supervisor is a native of Guangzhou, thus reinforcing the author’s argument that being a local is not solely defined by rural status → supports the author’s position, used to define ""local identity"" → **RL3 is endorsed**.
  *   - The phrase “家里也没有分红” contrasts the supervisor's situation with rural locals who receive dividends → the author is **resisting** the idea that such economic benefits are a criterion for being a ""true local"" → **RL6 is not endorsed**.
  *   - The contrast between rural and urban Guangzhou implies a conventional view of local identity boundaries, but the author is challenging that → **RL1 is not endorsed**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - Only RL3 is clearly used by the author to affirmatively define ""local identity"" — the native birth and upbringing in Guangzhou.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   - The author uses the supervisor’s native birth and upbringing (土生土长) to argue that being a ""true local"" doesn’t require rural status or community dividends, directly supporting RL3.

有祠堂有族谱没分红，阴公,RL6**," The author expresses a critical or sarcastic attitude toward a situation where someone has ancestral ties (e.g., clan hall, family genealogy) but lacks economic or social benefits (e.g., dividends). The phrase “阴公” (yin gong) is colloquial and conveys disappointment or mockery, suggesting that despite having traditional markers of local identity, the lack of material benefits renders the identity hollow or insufficient in some way.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “祠堂” (clan hall) and “族谱” (family genealogy): These point to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as they indicate deep ancestral roots.
  - “没分红” (no dividends): This points to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as it implies a lack of economic stake or benefit tied to community resources.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of clan hall and family genealogy establishes a claim to traditional or historical local identity.
  - The lack of dividends undermines or mocks the value of that identity, suggesting that **true local status or benefit requires more than just historical ties—it needs economic or social integration or benefit**.
  - The author is implying that without economic participation or benefit (dividends), traditional identity markers are insufficient or meaningless.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author critiques the **insufficiency of historical rootedness alone** (RL3) without economic integration (RL6), suggesting that **both matter in defining or validating local identity** in a meaningful way.
  - Therefore, the author implicitly **endorses RL6** as a necessary component for a meaningful local identity, while acknowledging RL3 as a traditional but insufficient marker.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL6** is clearly implied as the author ties economic status (dividends) to the **authenticity or value of local identity**.
  - **RL3** is referenced, but not fully endorsed as sufficient on its own; it is used more as a contrast to highlight the importance of RL6.
  - Therefore, only **RL6** is **explicitly or implicitly endorsed by the author as a criterion for defining meaningful ""local identity""**.

While not claiming to be a ""purebred local"" by traditional or rooted standards, they assert a strong identification with being a ""Foshan person"" — specifically as a ""Foshan native only child"", indicating that they define themselves as local not through deep ancestral roots or emotional ties to the countryside, but through upbringing and current identification with the urban area of Foshan.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""不算正宗本土本地人"" (not a正宗 local) – implies a standard of authenticity tied to deeper historical or rooted connection.
  * ""我爷奶那代已经在佛山"" (my grandparents’ generation were already in Foshan) – suggests a generational rootedness, though not necessarily in the countryside or with continued ties.
  * ""清明会翻乡下拜山"" (go back to the countryside for Qingming tomb-sweeping) – ritual or cultural connection to ancestral land, but not necessarily emotional or social belonging.
  * ""乡下已经无亲戚"" (no relatives left in the countryside) – indicates weakened family rootedness.
  * ""我对乡下无归属感"" (no sense of belonging to the countryside) – emotional disconnection from ancestral place.
  * ""我只会认为我是佛山人佛山本地独生女"" (I only consider myself a Foshan person, a native only child of Foshan) – strong identification with the city of Foshan, not based on ancestry or rural roots, but likely upbringing and current identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The mention of grandparents being in Foshan serves to partially establish a **family rootedness** (RL3), but not a strong one, since they migrated from the countryside and have since lost ties there.
  * The ritual connection to the countryside (Qingming) reflects **cultural habits** (RL4), but the author explicitly rejects emotional belonging to the countryside.
  * The author **rejects the rural ancestral place as a basis for identity**, and instead **asserts identification with Foshan city** — suggesting that **growing up in the city and identifying with it** is the basis of their local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author **does not endorse** deep family historical rootedness in the rural ancestral place (RL3) as a criterion for being local.
  * The author **does endorse** being born and raised in Foshan and identifying with it as a **local identity marker** — aligning with **RL3**, but in a **modern, urban context**.
  * The author **does not endorse cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)** as the main basis of identity, though it is mentioned in ritual form.
  * The author **clearly identifies as a Foshan person**, not by ancestry, but by **urban upbringing and self-identification** — aligning with **RL1** (socially conventional identity of being a Foshan person).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author identifies as a ""Foshan person"", which reflects a socially conventional identification with the city, even without deep ancestral ties. This is the **core identity claim** they make.
  * **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** While the family came from the countryside, the author grew up in Foshan and sees themselves as a ""Foshan native only child"", indicating that **growing up in the city**, rather than ancestral ties, is the basis of identity.

They emphasize that **self-identification with local culture (especially food and dialect)** and **the absence of identity doubt** are key to being considered a ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - *“你心里认为广州是你老家”* – internal认同 of place
  - *“文化上认同”* – cultural认同
  - *“当别人问你老家哪里的，你首先想到广州”* – self-identification with place
  - *“本地人是打心底里认同本地文化饮食的”* – cultural认同 and lifestyle (food)
  - *“不会有自己是哪里人的疑惑”* – absence of identity confusion
  - *“爷爷哪里人…在家里说爷爷老家的家乡话”* – family historical rootedness, but rejected as a valid criterion
  - *“每年还回爷爷老家”* – family historical rootedness, also rejected

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author **rejects family historical rootedness (RL3)** as a sufficient or even relevant criterion for being considered a local.
  - The author **emphasizes cultural认同 (RL4)** – including认同 of local culture, dialect, and food – as the **core** criterion.
  - The author also implies a **psychological boundary (RL1)** of who is considered local, based on internal认同 and emotional connection.
  - The author **highlights the absence of identity doubt** as a signifier of being truly local, which reinforces the internal认同 logic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** – clearly endorsed as a key standard.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** – indirectly endorsed through the idea of internal认同 and emotional belonging as defining psychological boundaries of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines ""local identity"" not through birthplace, family roots, or administrative status, but through **internal认同 of local culture and lifestyle (RL4)** and **a psychological sense of belonging without identity confusion (RL1)**. These two RL elements are used to **construct the author's definition of who truly counts as a ""local""**, and they are used to **reject other criteria such as family history (RL3)**.

**Output:** `RL1, RL4`"
判断是否广州本地人，就一个标准，有分红有祠堂有地,"RL3, RL6"," The author is clearly asserting a **standard for defining who is a ""local person"" in Guangzhou**, based on **three specific criteria: receiving community dividends, having ancestral halls, and owning land**. These are not just descriptive features but are used **normatively** by the author to judge local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The three key terms:
  - **有分红** (""has dividends"") → relates to community resource control and economic status → possibly **RL6**
  - **有祠堂** (""has ancestral halls"") → reflects family rootedness and historical continuity → possibly **RL3**
  - **有地** (""has land"") → implies property ownership in the area, potentially indicating deep social roots or economic symbolism → possibly **RL6**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These three elements are **presented as the sole standard** (""就一个标准"") for judging local identity.
  - Each of them contributes to defining **who counts as truly ""rooted"" or ""belonging"" locally**, not just socially or administratively, but in terms of **material, historical, and communal ties**.
  - The author is **not describing others’ views or resisting criteria**, but clearly **endorsing these as valid standards**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **有分红** → indicates access to community dividends, a form of local economic participation and control → **RL6**
  - **有祠堂** → indicates long-standing family presence and generational rootedness → **RL3**
  - **有地** → indicates ownership of land, a form of deep local investment and social rooting → **RL6**

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author defines ""local identity"" through **historical rootedness** (祠堂) and **economic and social rooting** (分红, 地), both of which align with **RL3 and RL6**.
  - These are not just features of the area or personal traits but are **used as evaluative standards** for who truly belongs as a local.

有没有租收？年底有没有分红？,RL6," The author is inquiring about whether there is rental income and whether there is a year-end dividend. These questions imply a concern with whether a place offers economic benefits typically associated with being a ""local"" with deep roots—especially in contexts like rural collectives or villages where land or property ownership entitles one to economic returns.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “租收” (rental income) implies economic benefits derived from property or land, which may be tied to local status.
  - “分红” (dividend) suggests participation in collective economic benefits, often reserved for those with formal or recognized local status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements are not just economic indicators; in many local contexts (especially rural or semi-collective urban villages), **only those who are recognized as “true locals” (e.g., through hukou, family rootedness, or community status)** are entitled to such benefits.
  - The author is likely evaluating or questioning whether the subject qualifies as a ""local"" by **implying that access to these economic benefits is a marker of local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not oppose or describe these as irrelevant; rather, the questions **suggest that these economic indicators are relevant to determining local status**.
  - These criteria are used to **evaluate whether someone is considered a ""rooted local""**, especially in communities where land or collective assets are involved.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - These criteria align with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, which includes **entitlement to community dividends, rental income from local property, and other economic benefits tied to deep-rooted local status**.
  - The author is **implicitly using these economic indicators as a standard to assess or question someone’s local identity or rootedness**, which is consistent with the RL6 framework.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: `RL6`"
有分红就算吧,RL6," The phrase ""有分红就算吧"" (If there are dividends, then it counts, I guess) implies a **reluctant or conditional acknowledgment** that having access to **community dividends** is being used as a **criterion for defining local identity** — specifically, for determining who counts as a ""local"" with **legitimate ties or benefits from the local area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key term is **""分红"" (dividends)** — which is a clear indicator of **community-level economic benefits**, likely tied to **collective assets or land development proceeds**, commonly seen in rural-urban fringe areas or villages with strong local collectives. This is not about general wealth, but about **local-specific economic entitlements**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The mention of **dividends** functions as a **criterion the author uses (or at least recognizes)** for defining who is considered a ""local"".
  - The tone ""就算吧"" (""counts as"", ""I guess"") suggests a **passive acceptance**, not strong endorsement, but still **acknowledges the logic as relevant**.
  - This is not a critique of others’ criteria — the author is not resisting it, but rather **implicitly validating it as a standard**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that **having access to community dividends** is a **marker of local identity**.
  - This falls under **RL6**, which deals with **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism**, particularly **community dividends**, **local asset ownership**, or **economic integration into the local system** as a **marker of authentic or rooted local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author sees **dividend entitlement** as a **functional criterion** for determining whether someone is considered a local — suggesting that **only those who are truly rooted in the community and integrated into its economic structure** (e.g., through land, lineage, or long-term residency) would receive such benefits.
  - This aligns with **RL6**, which emphasizes **economic and social embeddedness** as a **symbolic and practical marker of ""true local"" status**.

你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞,"RL4, RL6"," * The author is asserting that if someone cannot speak Cantonese (白话), they can only find low-status jobs in the local area (本地捞). The statement implies a strong link between language proficiency (specifically, speaking Cantonese) and social integration or job opportunities in the local context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase “你唔识得讲白话” (you can't speak Cantonese) points to **language** as a defining feature of local identity or integration.
  * The phrase “就只能系本地捞” (can only get jobs locally) implies a **status-based evaluation** tied to local identity, suggesting that those without language skills are relegated to local, likely lower-status roles.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The inability to speak Cantonese is **used as a criterion** to determine one's access to better jobs and thus their social positioning in the local context.
  * The author is **not resisting** this standard but is **endorsing it implicitly** by framing it as a given reality — if you don't speak the language, you are restricted to local, likely lower-tier opportunities.
  * This implies that **language (Cantonese)** is being used as a **marker of local belonging or outsider status**, which directly relates to how the author defines local identity or its boundaries.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly endorses **language (Cantonese)** as a **key determinant** of one's ability to integrate and access opportunities, thus defining who is considered a local or treated as an outsider.
  * There is also an implicit **social boundary** being drawn — those who can't speak the language are confined to lower-status roles, reinforcing the **symbolic boundary** of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** – The author is using **language (Cantonese)** as a key criterion to distinguish insiders (those who can speak it and presumably have better job access) from outsiders (those who can't and are restricted to local, lower-status jobs).
  * **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism** – The phrase “只能系本地捞” implies that **lack of language skill leads to limited economic opportunity**, suggesting that **true local integration involves access to broader economic and social networks**, not just being physically present or working locally.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase “识讲，又无口音” (can speak [Cantonese], and without an accent) points to a **cultural-linguistic** marker being used to define local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The linguistic criterion functions as a **core evaluative standard** in the author’s argument for determining who qualifies as a ""real"" local — a Guangzhou person is defined by the ability to speak the local language without a foreign or non-local accent.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly endorses the idea that **language and accent** are key to being considered a local, and this is not resisted or described as someone else’s standard.

They reject other potential markers—such as place of residence (白云, 越秀, 荔湾), native status (土著), or socio-economic status (分红)—and emphasize that **only those who can speak Cantonese deserve to be called 广州人**. Those who cannot speak Cantonese are told they should just identify as 中国人 instead.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **Cantonese language / linguistic identity**: Explicitly stated as the key criterion.
  - **Residential areas (白云, 越秀, 荔湾)**: Mentioned, but the author rejects them as defining criteria.
  - **Native status (土著) and economic benefits (分红)**: Mentioned, but the author rejects them as defining criteria.
  - **Ethnic or national identity (中国人)**: Used as a contrastive identity when someone does not meet the linguistic standard.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - **Cantonese language**: Central to the author’s argument; used as the **definitive standard** for identifying true locals.
  - **Residential areas, native status, economic benefits**: Used as **contrasting standards** that the author explicitly **rejects** as insufficient for defining ""local identity"".
  - **中国人**: Used as a **fallback identity** for those who don't meet the linguistic criterion.

  - This aligns directly with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which includes using language or dialect as a marker of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

我老公是佛山本地人，有分红，有族谱，祠堂几百年历史，已经是文物，但我儿子户口跟我，在我那边出生，那算是佛山人吗我同学老公也是佛山人，也是有分红，女儿户口在佛山，但全家回去我们那边生活，孩子算佛山人吗？,"** RL2, RL3"," The author is raising a question about the **definition of ""local identity"" (佛山人 — Foshan person)**, particularly in relation to **household registration (户口), family heritage (族谱, 祠堂), and actual residence**. The author is **uncertain** about what makes someone a ""Foshan person"" — whether it's family roots, administrative registration, or actual place of residence.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""佛山本地人"" — indicates local identity via birth or heritage.
  - ""有分红"" — indicates economic or social rootedness.
  - ""有族谱，祠堂几百年历史"" — indicates **family historical rootedness**.
  - ""户口跟我，在我那边出生"" — indicates **administrative legitimacy** (hukou).
  - ""女儿户口在佛山，但全家回去我们那边生活"" — again contrasts **hukou** with **actual residence** and **lifestyle**.

**Step 3: Analyze the Functional Role of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author presents **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** —族谱, 祠堂 — as **potential criteria** for being considered a local, but seems to question whether this alone is sufficient.
  - The author presents **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** —户口 — as a **formal but possibly insufficient** marker of local identity, since children may be registered in one place but live elsewhere.
  - The author implies that **residence and lifestyle** might also matter, though this is not clearly labeled as an RL5 or RL6 element, and is more of an **implicit challenge to the rigidity of existing criteria**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not explicitly endorse** any single criterion. Instead, the author **questions the validity of various criteria** (RL2 and RL3) and implies **ambiguity or inconsistency** in how ""local identity"" is defined.
  - However, the author **uses RL2 and RL3 as the criteria being considered** in determining local identity, even if they are not fully endorsed.
  - Since the author is **seeking to understand or define** ""Foshan person"" and presents these two RLs as **the standards being used or discussed**, they are **functionally part of the author's argument**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** — The author discusses hukou (户口) as a formal mechanism for determining local identity, even if it may not align with lived experience.
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — The author references族谱 (family genealogy) and祠堂 (ancestral hall) as markers of deep local heritage, which are **commonly accepted symbols of being a ""true local""** in many communities.

**Output:** RL2, RL3"
从小土生土长，会说流利白话就算是，别人也分辨不出来的，我的就是很浓的白云某村口音白话,RL4," *   The author is describing their own identity as a ""local"" person based on being born and raised in the area (""从小土生土长"") and being able to speak the local dialect fluently (""会说流利白话"") with a specific village accent (""白云某村口音"") that others can't easily distinguish. The core expressive intent is to assert that **fluency in the local dialect, especially with a specific local accent, is a key marker of being considered a local**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""从小土生土长"" – suggests a **growth history** in the area, potentially linking to **RL3**.
  *   ""会说流利白话"" – refers to **language proficiency**, specifically in the local dialect, linking to **RL4**.
  *   ""白云某村口音"" – refers to a **local accent**, also linking to **RL4**.
  *   ""别人也分辨不出来"" – implies that **linguistic fluency and accent authenticity** are criteria others use to judge local identity, reinforcing **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author uses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** to establish a personal connection to the place, but it's **not the main focus** of the argument.
  *   The main argument is that **speaking the local dialect fluently with a specific accent** is what **makes someone indistinguishable from a local**, thus serving as the **primary identity marker**.
  *   The author **endorses** this linguistic marker as a valid and effective **criterion for being recognized as local**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the **linguistic and accent-based criteria** as the **key way to define and be recognized as a local**.
  *   Therefore, **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is the **core RL category** used in the author's argument.
  *   While **RL3** is mentioned, it is **not central** to the author's **main argument**, which focuses on **language and accent** as the **main criteria** for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author constructs their local identity claim primarily through **linguistic fluency** and **accent authenticity**, which are core features of **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**.
  *   The author implies that **speaking the local dialect with a specific local accent** is **sufficient for being accepted as a local**, even if one's background might otherwise be unknown or ambiguous.

不算，我也是爷爷那一辈来广州定居，父亲和自己都是土生土长的，但是祖宗坟茔和宗祠都在老家。年年都要预留时间回老家扫墓。然后因为是在大院长大，跟本地人的圈子也融不进去，即使自己讲着一口广州话但是就是觉得差了这么一点可能真的只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同。,** RL3," The author is expressing a personal reflection on what it means to be genuinely considered a ""local"" (specifically a ""Cantonese"" or ""Guangzhou person""). Despite being born and raised in Guangzhou and speaking fluent Cantonese, the author feels a sense of exclusion due to lacking **deep ancestral roots** in the region. The author implies that **true local identity**—at least in terms of cultural认同 (acceptance/affiliation)—**requires generational rootedness**, not just personal birthplace or linguistic fluency.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""爷爷那一辈来广州定居"" (my grandfather’s generation settled in Guangzhou) → RL3
  - ""父亲和自己都是土生土长的"" (father and I were both born and raised here) → RL3
  - ""祖宗坟茔和宗祠都在老家"" (ancestral graves and ancestral hall are in the hometown) → RL3
  - ""年年都要预留时间回老家扫墓"" (must reserve time every year to return to hometown for tomb sweeping) → RL3
  - ""在大院长大，跟本地人的圈子也融不进去"" (grew up in a compound, couldn't integrate into the local social circle) → RL6 (social network)
  - ""讲着一口广州话"" (speaks fluent Cantonese) → RL4
  - ""差了这么一点...只有祖辈生于广州的才会形成广州人认同"" (lacks something... only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou can truly feel like Cantonese) → RL3

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The author repeatedly emphasizes that although they and their father were born and raised in Guangzhou, the lack of ancestral roots (祖宗坟茔, 宗祠) and the need to return to the ancestral hometown for tomb sweeping indicates a **lack of deep historical connection**, which the author sees as **the key to authentic local identity**.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: The author speaks fluent Cantonese but still feels excluded, suggesting that **language alone is insufficient** for being accepted as a local. This supports the idea that **linguistic fluency is not the decisive factor** in local identity.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The mention of being raised in a compound and not being able to integrate into the local social circle implies that **social networks and historical integration into the community** play a role in being accepted as a local. This is not the main argument but supports the author's sense of exclusion.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3** is clearly endorsed by the author as the **core criterion** for being seen as a ""true local"" — the author implies that only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou can form genuine Cantonese identity.
  - **RL4** is referenced, but the author **explicitly states that speaking Cantonese is not enough**, so it is **not endorsed** as a sufficient criterion.
  - **RL6** is mentioned, but it is more of an **effect** of not being considered a local rather than a **criterion the author endorses** for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that **true local identity (as a Cantonese person)** is not defined by personal birthplace or language fluency, but rather by **generational rootedness and ancestral ties to the land**. Despite being born and raised in Guangzhou and speaking the local dialect, the author feels they are not fully accepted as a local due to their family’s more recent migration history. This aligns with **RL3**, which focuses on **family historical rootedness** as the foundation of local identity.

**Output:** RL3"
你说我是不是广州人？我爷东莞人，抗日时期跑到广州来定居，我妈是广州农村，然后我户口跟我妈，我妈户口一直在村里，所以我有村分红，但是在村里属于外姓人,"**  
RL2, RL3, RL6"," The author is expressing a complex personal identity narrative, seeking affirmation of their ""local"" identity as a ""Guangzhou person"". They mention their family's migration history (grandfather moved from Dongguan during the Anti-Japanese War), their mother's rural Guangzhou origin, their hukou (household registration) being with their mother in a village, and their participation in village dividends. However, they are still considered an ""outsider surname"" in the village.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Family historical rootedness / growth history:
    - Grandfather moved to Guangzhou during the Anti-Japanese War
    - Mother is from Guangzhou's rural area
    - The speaker grew up under this family background
  - Administrative legitimacy:
    - The speaker's hukou is registered with their mother in the village
  - Depth of social roots & economic status symbolism:
    - The speaker receives village dividends
    - The speaker is considered an ""outsider surname"" in the village despite hukou and economic ties

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Family historical rootedness (RL3):** Used to argue for a long-standing local connection, potentially supporting a claim of being ""local"". The speaker's family has lived in Guangzhou for generations.
  - **Administrative legitimacy (RL2):** The speaker's hukou is registered in the Guangzhou village, which could be used as a formal criterion for local identity.
  - **Social roots & economic status (RL6):** Despite having hukou and receiving village dividends (indicating economic integration), the speaker is still treated as an outsider due to lacking deep social roots (being an ""outsider surname"").

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The speaker implicitly endorses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** and **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** as **potential bases** for claiming local identity.
  - However, the speaker also highlights that **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots)** is **used by the local community to exclude them**, despite their administrative and historical ties.
  - The overall tone is **ambivalent or questioning**, indicating that the author feels **these criteria are insufficient or inconsistently applied** in defining who is ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The speaker **invokes** RL3 and RL2 to **argue for their local identity**, but **points out** that RL6 is used to **exclude them**, revealing that the author believes these criteria are **important in defining local identity**, even if they personally feel they should not be.

**Output:**

听讲话无祠堂，非农户口，都有分红,"** RL2, RL4, RL6"," The author is expressing that someone who ""speaks without a clan hall (i.e., without local accent or linguistic identity), has a non-agricultural hukou (administrative identity), yet still receives village dividends (community economic benefits)"" is an unusual or noteworthy case. This implies a tension or surprise in how ""local identity"" is defined — suggesting that **despite lacking certain traditional or expected markers of local identity (language, lineage), the person still receives local benefits (dividends)**, which the author finds significant.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “听讲话无祠堂” – implies lack of local linguistic or cultural roots (RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - “非农户口” – indicates non-agricultural hukou, a legal/administrative identity (RL2: Administrative Legitimacy)
  - “都有分红” – receiving community dividends, indicating participation in local economic or social networks (RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase contrasts expectations with reality: the author implies that **one would not expect a non-local (due to lack of linguistic roots and non-local hukou)** to **still receive local benefits (dividends)**. This suggests that the author sees **linguistic-cultural identity (RL4) and administrative identity (RL2)** as **expected criteria** for local status, but observes that **economic participation (RL6)** may override or coexist with those criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not explicitly endorse any single criterion, but they **implicitly recognize** the relevance of **RL2 (hukou), RL4 (linguistic identity), and RL6 (dividends)** in defining local identity.
  - The surprise in the statement suggests that **these criteria are used by the author as a framework for understanding local identity**, even if the observed case deviates from expectations.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The mention of ""non-agricultural hukou"" is used to question whether the person is considered ""local"" in an administrative sense.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The lack of a ""clan hall accent"" is used to imply cultural distance from the local community.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The fact that the person ""receives dividends"" is used to imply some level of local integration, despite lacking the other two markers.

**Output:** RL2, RL4, RL6"
无嘎城市户口系无分红嘎。而且广州旧中心城区（清朝时起的城墙位置内）几百年前就无村噶啦。,"RL2, RL6"," The author is making a statement about what constitutes a ""local"" in Guangzhou, particularly emphasizing that having a city **hukou (household registration)** is essential for being considered a true local, as it determines eligibility for **village dividends**—a key social and economic benefit tied to local identity. Additionally, the author points out that the old central urban area of Guangzhou (within the walls from the Qing Dynasty era) has long ceased to be rural or village-based, suggesting that the historical transformation of the area plays a role in defining who counts as a local today.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""城市户口"" (urban hukou) → RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)
- ""分红"" (dividends) → RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
- ""广州旧中心城区（清朝时起的城墙位置内）几百年前就无村噶啦"" → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL2 (户口):** Used as a **core standard** by the author to distinguish true locals from others. The author implies that without an urban hukou, one is not considered a legitimate local and cannot access local privileges like dividends.
- **RL6 (分红):** Functions as a **marker of local inclusion and privilege**, reinforcing the idea that only those with deep administrative and social ties (via hukou) are considered authentic locals.
- **RL1 (旧中心城区):** The author **refutes the idea** that the old urban core is still rural or village-like, implying that its transformation invalidates any rural-based claims to local identity in that area.
- **RL3 (几百年前就无村):** The author **dismisses historical settlement** as a relevant criterion for defining locals today, suggesting that time and urbanization have erased ancestral ties as a basis for local identity in this context.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- **RL2** and **RL6** are **explicitly endorsed** by the author as valid criteria for defining local identity.
- **RL1** is **partially referenced** but used to **reject an outdated view**, not to affirm it as the author’s own standard.
- **RL3** is used to **negate** historical rootedness as a current standard, so it is not endorsed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author clearly defines ""local identity"" in Guangzhou through **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** — specifically, urban hukou — and **economic participation/status (RL6)** — particularly access to village dividends. These two RLs are **explicitly linked** to the author's view of who qualifies as a ""local"" and who does not.

**Step 6: Output Result**

我就前几日听一个认识几年噶网友讲话有噶 话距地有一段时间全部农转居，但是都仲有分红。唔记得距系越秀定荔湾了。我都奇怪，因为我地番禺是农户先有分红,"** RL2, RL6"," The author is expressing confusion or observation about how certain areas (越秀 or 荔湾) that were previously rural have undergone农转居 (conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural household status), yet still maintain certain economic benefits like dividends. In contrast, the author notes that in 番禺, only农户 (agricultural households) receive dividends. This implies a perceived difference in the **economic and administrative treatment** of local identity between different districts.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""农转居"" — indicates a policy or administrative change in household registration (hukou) status, suggesting a **legal or administrative boundary shift**.
  - ""分红"" — refers to economic benefits or community dividends, often tied to local collective ownership or community status.
  - ""越秀"" / ""荔湾"" / ""番禺"" — specific administrative districts, indicating **regional identity distinctions**.
  - The author is comparing different administrative regions and their treatment of local economic rights, particularly how ""local"" status affects access to dividends.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - ""农转居"" and ""分红"" are used to highlight **administrative legitimacy and its connection to economic benefits**, suggesting the author sees a **link between hukou status and local identity**.
  - The mention of specific districts shows the author is aware of and making distinctions based on **administrative geography**, which plays into **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - The contrast between 番禺 and other districts (越秀/荔湾) also implies that **local identity is not purely based on current residence**, but on **historical administrative status and access to collective benefits**, which relates to **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not resist or negate these criteria; rather, they are **used to question or reflect on the differences in how ""local"" is defined across districts**.
  - The discussion centers around **who gets to be considered a ""local"" in terms of economic rights**, which is a **core part of the author's observation**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author refers to ""农转居"" and mentions specific administrative districts, indicating that **local identity is tied to administrative boundaries and household registration status**.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author discusses ""分红"" (dividends), which are **community-based economic benefits**, and contrasts how different areas handle them, implying that **economic ties and local resource access are criteria for defining ""local""**.

我家旧唐楼系大东门附近，幼儿园时就收咗补楼而已。分红真系无。有族谱，但系基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦,RL3," *   The author is describing their family background and early life experience in a pre-war residential building (""旧唐楼"") near Da Dongmen. They mention that the building was already purchased (""收咗补楼"") by the time they were in kindergarten, implying long-standing local settlement. However, they also mention that although there is a clan genealogy (""族谱""), most people listed in it are no longer in China (""基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦""). This suggests a contrast between **actual local rootedness** and **ancestral or nominal connection**, with the author implicitly emphasizing the importance of **local settlement and lived experience** over **genealogical or ancestral ties**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""旧唐楼"" (old residential building): May imply **RL3** if linked to long-term local living.
  *   - ""幼儿园时就收咗补楼"" (bought the building already when in kindergarten): Strong indicator of **RL3**, suggesting early and long-term local settlement.
  *   - ""分红真系无"" (no dividends): May relate to **RL6**, but the author explicitly denies it, so **not endorsed**.
  *   - ""有族谱"" (have a clan genealogy): May relate to **RL3** or **RL6**, but the next sentence clarifies that this is **not relevant**.
  *   - ""基本里面嘎人都5系中国啦"" (basically the people in it are no longer in China): Suggests **genealogical ties ≠ local identity**, so **rejects** this as a criterion.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   - ""幼儿园时就收咗补楼"" functions as **positive evidence** that the author or their family has **long-standing local presence**, supporting the idea that **local identity is tied to long-term residence and settlement**.
  *   - ""有族谱...5系中国啦"" functions as **negative contrast**, showing that **genealogy or ancestry is not a valid criterion** for being considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Only the **early and long-term local settlement** is endorsed by the author as a meaningful basis for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author emphasizes that their family has been living locally since their kindergarten years, suggesting **deep local roots through long-term residence and settlement**, which aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  *   The author **rejects** ancestral ties or clan genealogy as valid markers of local identity, thus **excluding RL6 and other genealogical markers**.

我都系甘葛情况，我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著,RL3," The author is describing their family's identity in relation to Guangzhou. They state that both they and their father have ""老西"" (lǎo xī, a term usually referring to people from Shanxi province) connections, and although they are ""广州人"" (Guangzhou people), they do not consider themselves ""土著"" (indigenous/local people). The core idea is the author's **self-identification as not fully belonging to the local Guangzhou identity**, due to their family background and generational migration history.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “我同我老豆都系老西关系” – indicates family origin from Shanxi, not native to Guangzhou.
- “广州人但系应该唔系土著” – identifies as Guangzhou people but not indigenous/local.

These statements suggest a **distinction between being a ""Guangzhou person"" and being a ""local"" (土著)**, with the author clearly drawing a boundary based on **family historical rootedness**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The family's origin (老西) and the author's self-awareness of not being a ""土著"" play a **central role** in their identity construction. The author **implicitly acknowledges** that being a ""local"" requires deeper historical ties than just being born or living in Guangzhou.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that being a ""local"" (土著) requires **long-term family rootedness** in the region. They distinguish themselves from ""土著"" based on their family's migration background from Shanxi.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author's self-identification as non-土著 is based on their family's generational background and origin outside of Guangzhou.

They argue against the idea that having a village or ancestral house alone defines local identity, instead emphasizing **ongoing cultural practices and language use** as the more authentic markers of being ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""有没有融入当地的文化"" → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**
  *   ""祠堂"", ""祖屋"", ""组成一条村"" → **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**
  *   ""过年过节都是按原来的家乡习俗"" → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**
  *   ""称呼本地人会说你们本地人"" → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**
  *   ""当地语言也会讲，但同村人交流还是用家乡话"" → **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL4 elements** are central to the author's core argument — they believe that **not speaking the local language in daily life and not adopting local customs** means one is **not truly a local**, even if they have lived there for generations.
  *   **RL3 elements** are mentioned, but the author **downplays their significance** — they acknowledge ancestral ties and the existence of a village and ancestral house, but do **not accept these as sufficient conditions** for being considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** RL4 as the **primary standard** for defining local identity.
  *   The author **implicitly resists** RL3 as a sufficient standard — they mention it but argue that it's not enough.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's main argument is that **cultural and linguistic integration (RL4)** is the **key standard** for being considered a local. They reject the idea that **family history or ancestral structures (RL3)** alone are enough. This is clearly and directly stated in the phrase: “我觉得我们没有完全融入当地文化，就不算本地人.”

They are not merely describing a lifestyle or preference, but are **affirming** specific identity markers that affirm their belonging as ""local"" — including ancestral ties, burial customs, and linguistic fluency without accent.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""籍贯广州"" (native place is Guangzhou) → RL2 (hukou/birthplace), RL3 (family historical rootedness)
  - ""广州村民"" (Guangzhou villager) → RL6 (social roots in a local community)
  - ""清明去白云山上拜"" (Qingming ancestral worship on Baiyun Mountain) → RL3 (family historical rootedness)
  - ""几代祖先都在山上，而不是去公共墓园"" (several generations of ancestors are buried there, not in a public cemetery) → RL3 (family historical rootedness)
  - ""家庭所有成员粤语完全不带口音"" (all family members speak Cantonese without accent) → RL4 (cultural-linguistic recognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These elements are not just descriptions — they are **used by the author to assert a strong, multi-dimensional local identity**. The author is **affirming** that being a ""local"" is defined by a combination of:
    - **Historical family presence** (RL3): multiple generations buried locally, rooted in the land.
    - **Cultural fluency** (RL4): native Cantonese speaker with no accent.
    - **Administrative and birth-based identity** (RL2): native of Guangzhou, possibly with hukou.
    - **Community belonging** (RL6): being a villager implies embeddedness in local social structures and traditions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  All the above RL elements are **endorsed by the author** and **used to define or affirm their own local identity**. They are not resisting or critiquing these standards — they are **presenting them as validating their own ""local"" status**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author's native place being Guangzhou implies a birth-based or hukou-based claim to being local.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** Multiple generations of ancestors buried on Baiyun Mountain, and ancestral worship there, indicate deep family historical ties to the area.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** Speaking Cantonese without accent is a strong marker of being culturally ""local"".
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots):** Being a ""villager"" implies long-standing social integration and community identity.

This suggests a **complex, internalized understanding of what constitutes being ""local""**, and the author implies that **birth and upbringing alone may not be sufficient** for full local identification.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""我妈妈是白云区某村有祠堂的"" — This indicates **family historical rootedness** in a specific local village with a clan hall (祠堂), suggesting deep ancestral ties.
  - ""爸爸是潮汕归侨"" — This introduces a **non-local ethnic or cultural background** (潮汕) and **immigrant status** (归侨), which the author implicitly sees as affecting their local identity.
  - ""我广州土生土长"" — This clearly indicates **individual growth history** in Guangzhou.
  - ""我觉得自己只是半个广州人"" — This is the **core evaluative judgment**, suggesting that **multiple factors beyond just growing up in Guangzhou** are used in defining ""local identity"".

  - The mention of the mother’s clan-based village background (祠堂) is used to show **deep local roots** and **family historical rootedness**, which the author sees as contributing to a ""full"" local identity — implying that this is a **criterion** they themselves endorse.
  - The father being a 潮汕归侨 is used to **explain the lack of full local identification**, suggesting the author believes **cultural-linguistic background** (潮汕 dialect and customs) and **migration history** affect local belonging.
  - The fact of being born and raised in Guangzhou is presented as **not sufficient** on its own — showing that while **individual growth history** is recognized, it is **not the sole standard**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses:
    - **Family historical rootedness** (RL3): The clan background is presented as a positive, legitimate basis for full local identity.
    - **Cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4): The 潮汕 background is seen as a differentiating factor, implying that **language and cultural habits** matter.
    - **Individual growth history** (RL3): Though not sufficient alone, it is still a **recognized and endorsed** component of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that to be a full ""local"" (广州人), one should ideally:
    - Have **deep family historical roots in the area** (RL3).
    - Be **culturally and linguistically aligned** with the local group (RL4).
    - Be **born and raised locally** (RL3), though this alone is not enough.
  - These elements function together to support the author's sense of being only ""half"" a local, due to **partial alignment** with these criteria.

**Output:** RL3, RL4"
？？？我广州话有乡音，我都系广州人，去祠堂都系讲乡音,"RL3, RL4"," *   The author is asserting their identity as a ""Guangzhou person"" (广州人), emphasizing that despite having a regional accent (乡音) in their Cantonese (广州话), they still identify strongly as a local. The mention of going to the ancestral hall (去祠堂) and using the local dialect there further reinforces their sense of rootedness and authenticity as a ""local person.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""广州话"" (Cantonese) – potentially related to **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition).
  *   ""乡音"" (regional accent) – potentially related to **RL4**, as it implies a local linguistic identity.
  *   ""广州人"" (Guangzhou person) – directly expresses local identity.
  *   ""去祠堂"" (go to the ancestral hall) – implies **family historical rootedness**, potentially related to **RL3**.
  *   Implicitly, the ancestral hall and乡音 together suggest **intergenerational continuity** and **cultural practice**, both of which are **RL3** and **RL4** markers.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author uses **RL4** (language and accent) to **defend or affirm their local identity** in the face of possible doubt (perhaps due to their accent). This implies that **linguistic-cultural identity is a standard they believe should define local identity**.
  *   The mention of ancestral hall and乡音 together implies that **family heritage and cultural continuity** (RL3) are also **endorsed by the author as valid criteria** for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Both **RL3** and **RL4** are **explicitly used by the author** to **support their own claim to local identity**, thus they are **endorsed criteria**.
  *   There is no mention of administrative boundaries, economic status, or environmental quality, so **RL1, RL2, RL5, RL6, and RL7 are not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author constructs their identity as a ""Guangzhou person"" based on **linguistic identity** (RL4) and **family historical rootedness** (RL3), suggesting that these are **valid criteria for defining local identity**.

虽然我家也好几代在这边，也是讲粤语，但是只说我是广州本地人，但不算广州土著，因为我是番禺的,"** RL1, RL4"," The author is expressing a **distinction between being a ""local"" and being a ""native"" (土著)** in the context of Guangzhou. Despite having lived in the area for generations and speaking Cantonese, the author feels that being from Panyu excludes them from being considered a ""true native"" of Guangzhou. This reflects an **implicit acceptance of certain criteria that distinguish ""locals"" from ""natives""**, particularly based on **sub-regional identity and cultural-linguistic perception**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""好几代在这边"" → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)
- ""讲粤语"" → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
- ""不算广州土著，因为我是番禺的"" → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- **RL3** (Family rootedness): The author shows they have deep family roots in the area, which could be used as a criterion for being considered ""local"", but this is **not sufficient** in the author’s perceived social framework.
- **RL4** (Cantonese speaking): The author shares the dominant language of the region, which is often a strong marker of local identity, yet it's still **not enough** to qualify as a ""native"".
- **RL1** (Sub-regional identity): The author **accepts the conventional view** that being from Panyu places them outside the core ""native"" identity of Guangzhou, indicating a **socially accepted mental map** that differentiates sub-regions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author implicitly accepts:
- The idea that **sub-regional identity (Panyu vs. core Guangzhou)** defines whether someone is a ""native"" — this is **RL1**.
- They **do not reject** the linguistic marker as part of local identity — this is **RL4**.
- Although they mention generational presence, they do **not strongly endorse** it as a defining criterion of being a ""土著"" — so **RL3 is not included**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author accepts that:
- There is a **socially conventional distinction** between Panyu and ""core Guangzhou"" in terms of native identity (RL1).
- Speaking Cantonese is **part of local identity**, but not the sole determinant of being a ""native"" (RL4).

**Output:** RL1, RL4"
别纠结了基本不是，民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门。我家没有祠堂，清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来。广州土著大部分都走国外，留下来万中无一，美加香港南洋比广州更多广州土著。,"RL1, RL3"," *   The author is asserting that **being a ""local"" in Guangzhou is not merely a matter of current residence or superficial connection**, but rather involves **historical rootedness** and **long-term migration patterns**. The text emphasizes that **""true locals"" are rare**, with most having **left Guangzhou for overseas**, implying that **those who stayed are exceptions**. The author also suggests that **family history and generational movement** are key to defining ""local identity"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""民国前广州城只有西门口到大东门"" (Before the Republic era, Guangzhou city was only from Ximenkou to Dadongmen) → **RL1** (historical territorial cognition)
  *   - ""我家没有祠堂"" (My family doesn't have an ancestral hall) → **RL3** (implies lack of deep generational roots)
  *   - ""清朝在西关做生意后来家族逃出去又回来"" (In Qing dynasty, our family did business in Xiguan, later the clan escaped and came back) → **RL3** (family migration history used to reflect on local identity)
  *   - ""广州土著大部分都走国外"" (Most Guangzhou natives went abroad) → **RL3** (migration history as a marker of local identity)
  *   - ""留下来万中无一"" (Those who stayed are one in ten thousand) → **RL3** (implies rarity of true locals based on rootedness)
  *   - ""美加香港南洋比广州更多广州土著"" (There are more Guangzhou natives in the US, Canada, HK, and Nanyang than in Guangzhou) → **RL3** (migration and dispersal as criteria for judging local identity)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **RL1** element sets a **historical boundary** of what was traditionally considered Guangzhou, implying that modern definitions of ""local"" are diluted or expanded.
  *   The **RL3** elements collectively serve to **deconstruct the idea of current residents being ""true locals""**, emphasizing instead **historical rootedness**, **generational presence**, and **migration patterns** as the **real criteria** for being considered a ""native"" or ""true local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly **uses historical territorial understanding (RL1)** to contrast with current perceptions of ""local"".
  *   The author also **strongly implies that family history and migration patterns (RL3)** are the **real markers of being a true local**, even though their own family history does not fully meet this standard.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's argument hinges on the idea that **""local identity"" in Guangzhou should be defined by historical settlement boundaries (RL1)** and **generational rootedness/migration history (RL3)**, not just current residence or superficial traits. The text implies that **modern ""locals"" may not truly qualify under these historical and familial criteria**.

世代居住在广州虽然各种原因移居但坚持保留广州语言文化饮食习惯传统精神内核的社群是不是比现在只讲普通话唔食白切鸡唔听粤语歌的本地人更广州？当然土不土著没啥优越的传统跟不上时代被抛弃也是必然。,RL4," The author is posing a rhetorical question that challenges the conventional understanding of what makes someone ""more local"" in the context of Guangzhou. The core argument is that **maintaining cultural and linguistic traditions (even after physical relocation)** might make a person or group ""more Guangzhou"" than those born and currently living there but who have abandoned those traditions. The author also suggests that **being ""native"" or ""indigenous"" does not inherently grant superiority**, and those who fail to adapt or maintain cultural relevance may be left behind.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""世代居住在广州""** (generations living in Guangzhou) → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)
  - **""坚持保留广州语言文化饮食习惯传统精神内核""** (insisting on preserving Guangzhou’s language, culture, food habits, and traditional core values) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - **""只讲普通话唔食白切鸡唔听粤语歌的本地人""** (Mandarin-only speaking locals who don't eat white-cut chicken or listen to Cantonese songs) → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)
  - **""土不土著没啥优越""** (being indigenous doesn't grant superiority) → Implicitly **resists** RL3 and RL1
  - **""传统跟不上时代被抛弃也是必然""** (those who fail to keep up with the times will be left behind) → Implicitly **resists** RL3 and RL4

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)** is **initially referenced** to highlight a traditional view of ""localness"" (long-term residence and generational continuity), but the author **questions its sufficiency** by contrasting it with cultural continuity.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is **used to challenge the traditional view**, suggesting that **cultural preservation is a more meaningful marker of local identity than mere physical or generational presence**.
  - The author **resists the idea that being native (RL3) or having a certain territorial identity (RL1)** automatically makes someone more ""local"" — instead, **cultural behavior and continuity are more important**.
  - The statement about being left behind suggests a **dynamic, evolving view of local identity**, where **static traditionalism (RL3/RL4 in isolation)** is insufficient without adaptation.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not fully endorse RL3** as the main criterion for being ""local"" — it is referenced but questioned.
  - The author **implicitly endorses RL4** as a **more meaningful or legitimate** basis for local identity, especially when it persists beyond physical location.
  - The author **resists RL1 and RL3 as standalone criteria**, and also suggests that **pure traditionalism without adaptation is insufficient** (so not fully endorsing RL4 in a static form either).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs a **re-evaluation of local identity**, where **cultural and linguistic continuity (RL4)** is more indicative of being ""truly local"" than **generational residence (RL3)** or **territorial identity (RL1)**. The author **questions traditional markers of localness** and implies that **active preservation of local culture**, even after migration, is a **more authentic form of local identity**.

This indicates the author's **implicit criteria for defining local identity**, suggesting that **mere residence or even multigenerational presence is not sufficient** to be considered a ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""我外公开始来广州工作"" – indicates early family settlement in Guangzhou (possible RL3).
  *   ""我妈他们在广州长大的"" – indicates generational presence in Guangzhou (possible RL3).
  *   ""在家也都是说粤语"" – use of local dialect (possible RL4).
  *   ""只有清明才会回老家"" – limited connection to ancestral hometown (possible RL3).
  *   ""他们不会说自己是广州人"" – explicit statement of non-identification as local, implying the author believes **more than family history or language** is needed to be considered a local (core argument).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness): The author mentions generational presence in Guangzhou, but this is used to **contrast** with the lack of local identification — suggesting that **even multi-generational presence is not sufficient**.
  *   RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition): Use of粤语 at home might suggest cultural integration, but the author still does **not** consider the family as locals — indicating that **language alone is not sufficient**.
  *   The author's **core argument is that local identity is not simply about history or language**, but something **more elusive or deeper**, perhaps implying **social recognition or deeper integration** (RL6 might be relevant here, though not directly stated).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   RL3: Though mentioned, it is used to **refute** the idea that family history alone defines local identity.
  *   RL4: Language use is present but also **not sufficient**, again used to **refute** a common assumption.
  *   The author implies that **local identity requires more than just generational presence or language use** — possibly deeper social integration or recognition, though not explicitly stated. Therefore, **RL6 is not directly endorsed**, but the author's **implicit logic** suggests that **something beyond RL3 and RL4 is needed**, and thus the **negation of these categories serves the author’s argument**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author **does not endorse** any criteria that define local identity, but instead **refutes** the sufficiency of **RL3 (family rootedness)** and **RL4 (language)**.

The author contrasts this with their own identity — even though they or their family have lived in Guangzhou for at least five generations and have local ties (including property and dividends) — yet they are still labeled as ""Guangzhou Hakka"" (广州客家人), which implies a distinction from the ""true locals"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of specific historical districts: 老越秀、老荔湾、老东山、海珠 → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - Emphasis on long-term generational presence: 至少五代都在广州土生土长 → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - Reference to land and community dividends: 有分红有地 → RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - Identity distinction: 广州客家人 → RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition), though not directly mentioning dialect, it implies cultural categorization

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL1 (Territorial Identity): The author implicitly defines the ""core local"" area as the old four districts, suggesting that these areas have a special symbolic status in defining ""true local identity"".
  - RL3 (Generational Presence): The author points out that even with five generations of local heritage, one is still not considered a ""true local"" — this serves to critique or question the strictness of the prevailing local identity criteria.
  - RL6 (Social Roots & Economic Status): Ownership of land and receiving community dividends are presented as indicators of deep local integration, yet even these are not sufficient to be called a ""true local"".
  - RL4 (Cultural Categorization): The label ""Guangzhou Hakka"" implies a cultural or linguistic distinction that prevents full integration into the ""local"" identity, even with deep historical and economic ties.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is not opposing these criteria outright but is expressing that they are the **standards used in society** to define ""true locals"" — and that even with strong RL3 and RL6 credentials, one may still be excluded due to RL1 and RL4 factors. Therefore, these criteria are **endorsed by the author as part of the prevailing logic**, even if they may be critiquing or observing the exclusion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author believes that people should use the logic of **historical territorial identity** (RL1), **generational rootedness** (RL3), **social and economic integration** (RL6), and **cultural categorization** (RL4) to define who is or is not considered a ""true local"" in Guangzhou.

**Output:** RL1, RL3, RL4, RL6"
讲白话？,** RL4," The author's core expressive intent is to question or provoke a discussion about whether speaking the local dialect (Cantonese, in this context) is a necessary criterion for being considered a ""local"" person in a certain area (likely Guangdong or Hong Kong), implying a challenge to the idea of using **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** as a defining factor of ""local identity"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The phrase “讲白话？” (literally, “speak Cantonese?”) suggests a **linguistic criterion** for being considered a local. This directly relates to **RL4**, as it implies that the ability to speak the local dialect is potentially a **gatekeeping mechanism** or **implicit expectation** for being accepted as a ""local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase functions as a **provocative question** that highlights or critiques the **linguistic gatekeeping** often used to distinguish locals from non-locals. The author may be **questioning or resisting** this criterion, but the mere invocation of the linguistic standard indicates that the author is **aware of and responding to** the widespread use of **RL4** in defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Although the author may not personally endorse the linguistic criterion, the question itself **acknowledges the existence and relevance** of this standard in the social discourse around local identity. The author is **engaging with the logic of RL4**, even if critically or sarcastically, which makes it a **relevant criterion for annotation**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The criterion in question is clearly **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it centers on the use of dialect or language as a marker of local identity.

**Output:** RL4"
有分红就算,RL6," * The author is expressing that having access to community dividends is a meaningful marker of being considered a ""local"" or having a rooted connection to the area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase “有分红” (has dividends) points to a criterion related to economic benefits derived from local resources or community assets.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase implies that receiving community dividends is a **symbol of belonging**—indicating that the individual or group has a **vested interest or rootedness** in the local area, likely due to long-standing ties or ownership.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is **endorsing** the idea that having access to dividends is a valid or important **marker of local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This aligns with **RL6: Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism**, which includes **community dividends** as a symbol of rootedness and local identity.

不会说不算,** RL4," * The phrase ""不会说不算"" (if you can't speak it, you're not counted) implies that the ability to speak a certain language or dialect is a **criterion for inclusion** in the local group. The author is suggesting that **linguistic competence** is a gatekeeping mechanism for being considered a ""local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The key phrase centers on language ability — specifically, the ability to speak the local language or dialect. This maps directly to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase functions as a **criterion for exclusion or inclusion** — if one does not speak the local language, they are not considered a local. The author implicitly endorses this as a **legitimate standard** for defining local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author is not resisting or describing someone else's standard — they are presenting a **norm they accept**: linguistic competence = local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This clearly aligns with **RL4**, which defines local identity through language, dialect, or accent. The author uses this as a **gatekeeping mechanism** for local identity.

**Output:** RL4"
看年龄，时代不一样，现在00后很多土生土长的广州人也不会粤语,"** RL3, RL4"," The author is pointing out that with changing times (and generations), even native-born Cantonese (广州人) of the 00s generation may not speak Cantonese (粤语), suggesting a weakening link between birthplace and cultural-linguistic identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""土生土长的广州人"" (native-born Cantonese) — potentially relates to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - ""不会粤语"" (cannot speak Cantonese) — potentially relates to **RL4** (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""土生土长的广州人"" (native-born Cantonese) is used to indicate someone who, by conventional standards, should qualify as ""local."" However, the author contrasts this with the fact that many such individuals no longer speak粤语, suggesting that **birth and upbringing alone may no longer be sufficient markers of local identity**.
  - The phrase ""不会粤语"" functions as a **criterion for distinguishing authentic ""localness""**, implying that **language proficiency is still a significant cultural marker**, even if it is no longer universally present among native-born individuals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does not explicitly endorse or oppose either criterion outright but **highlights a contradiction or shift**: native birth (RL3) is no longer a reliable indicator of cultural integration (RL4). However, by framing粤语 ability as a notable absence in otherwise ""local"" individuals, the author **implicitly treats language as a meaningful standard for local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author references native birth and upbringing in Canton, suggesting that these are still conventional markers of local identity, even if they no longer guarantee cultural fluency.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The inability to speak粤语 is framed as a notable deviation, implying that **language remains a culturally significant criterion for evaluating local identity**, even if it's not always met.

**Output:** RL3, RL4"

They imply that **for someone born in the 1980s**, not speaking Cantonese is unusual, whereas **for someone born around 2000**, it is perfectly normal. This reflects a **cultural-linguistic standard** for defining ""local identity"", where fluency or early acquisition of the local language is seen as a key criterion for being considered a ""local person"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""从小是从什么时候开始？"" — This rhetorical question emphasizes the **importance of when someone starts growing up locally**, which could relate to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  * ""如果80年代生，不会说广州话不太可能"" — Being born in the 1980s and not speaking Cantonese is considered unlikely, implying **early exposure to local language** as a norm, which ties into **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**.
  * ""如果00年生，也很正常"" — For someone born in the 2000s, not speaking Cantonese is normal, suggesting a **shift in linguistic expectations** over time, again pointing to **RL4**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses generational change in language use to show that **Cantonese fluency is no longer a guaranteed marker of local identity**, especially among younger generations. This supports the idea that **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is a key criterion, and that its **application has changed over time**.
  * The reference to growing up locally (""从小是从什么时候开始？"") supports **RL3**, as it implies that **when someone starts being rooted locally affects whether they are expected to speak the local language**, and thus, whether they are seen as a ""true local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * **RL4** is clearly endorsed — the author believes that **language is a valid and historically relevant standard** for judging local identity.
  * **RL3** is also endorsed — the author implies that **when someone was born and grew up locally** affects whether they are expected to meet the RL4 criterion, making it functionally relevant.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is making a point about how **Cantonese fluency**, a **cultural-linguistic** marker (RL4), has traditionally been used to define local identity in Guangzhou. However, this expectation is **tied to when someone grew up locally** (RL3), with earlier generations being more likely to meet the standard. The author seems to be acknowledging a **shift in what defines a ""local person""**, especially among younger generations.

The author seems to be **questioning what it truly means to be a ""local""** when linguistic fluency — a commonly assumed marker of local identity — can be so thoroughly adopted by outsiders.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The text discusses:
  - **Language acquisition and fluency in粤语** (RL4)
  - **Length of residence and assimilation** into粤语-speaking culture (RL3)
  - **Observation of generational differences** and identity blending (not directly an RL category, but relevant to interpretation)
  - **Implicit contrast between ""local"" identity and actual linguistic behavior**, suggesting a **challenge to conventional criteria** (possibly RL1 or RL4)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **粤语 fluency** (RL4) is used as a **benchmark of local identity** in the author’s mind, but it's also shown to be **acquirable and not exclusive to locals**, thus undermining its reliability as a criterion.
  - The **length of time living locally** (RL3) is implied as a reason for this fluency, suggesting that **local identity can be acquired through immersion**, not just birth or upbringing.
  - The author **does not endorse** any specific RL category as the definitive standard, but rather **questions the boundaries and markers of local identity**, especially when traditional markers (like language) can be mimicked or fully adopted.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Although the author **questions** the reliability of **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** as a marker of local identity, they **still treat it as a relevant standard** that people commonly use.
  - The **acquisition of粤语 through long-term exposure** implies that **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is not the only path to local linguistic fluency or identity.
  - The author does **not explicitly endorse** administrative, economic, or occupational markers (RL2, RL5, RL6, RL7), nor do they propose a new standard.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** is clearly present, as the author evaluates local identity through粤语 fluency and accent.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is implied, as the author notes that fluency developed over time, suggesting that **growing up in the environment can shape local identity**, even for outsiders.

The author suggests that the latter is a more authentic or deeply rooted form of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""广州出世"" (born in Guangzhou) → potentially related to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - ""广州某村出世"" (born in a specific village in Guangzhou) → also **RL3**
  - ""有分红"" (having dividends) → potentially related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - ""有地"" (owning land) → also **RL6**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 elements** (""born in Guangzhou"", ""born in a specific village"") are used to define **degrees of local identity**, with village-level birth being a more specific and authentic form of local belonging.
  - **RL6 elements** (""having land"", ""having dividends"") are used to **further distinguish** between those with superficial local ties (just born in the city) and those with deeper, more rooted local status (with land and dividends).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL3** and **RL6** are **endorsed by the author** and used to define **""local people""** in a layered or hierarchical way.
  - The author implies that **birthplace alone is not enough** for being considered a ""true local"" — deeper economic and social roots are also necessary for being a ""土著"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is clearly used to define local identity based on birth and generational rootedness.
  - **RL6** is used to distinguish a more privileged or authentic form of local identity based on economic and social integration (land ownership, dividends).
  - Together, they reflect the author’s view that ""local"" is not a single category but a **hierarchy**, with ""土著"" representing a higher or more rooted form of local identity.

**Output:** RL3, RL6"
那你有没分红或者土地阿？,RL6," The text is a question asking whether someone has received dividends or owns land. This implies an interest in the person's **material or economic stake** in a local area — specifically, whether they benefit from local resources or have a tangible connection to the land. The question subtly probes the **validity or depth of the person's local identity** by referencing economic and property-based indicators.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key terms “分红” (dividends) and “土地” (land) are economic indicators that imply a person's **material or financial connection** to a local area. These are closely related to the idea of **local rootedness through economic or social capital** rather than just geography or culture.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The question is framed as a **test or standard** for evaluating whether someone is truly “local” — not just by residence or background, but by whether they **benefit from or are materially tied to the area**. This implies that the speaker sees such economic ties as **important markers of authentic local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The speaker **implicitly endorses** the idea that **having dividends or land** is a meaningful standard for evaluating someone’s local status. This aligns with **RL6**, which focuses on **economic ties, ownership of land or property, and depth of social roots** as criteria for defining or evaluating local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The speaker uses the presence or absence of dividends or land ownership as a **benchmark for assessing local belonging**. This matches the RL6 definition: the speaker is implying that **true locals have material or economic stakes in the area**, such as land or community dividends, which serve as markers of **genuine or rooted local identity**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL6"
有分红，屋企有栋有红本子的楼,"**  
RL6"," The author is expressing that having **dividends** and owning a **building with a red property ownership certificate (红本子)** are important indicators, likely of **local status or rootedness**. This implies that such **economic and property-based markers** are criteria the author uses to define or recognize **authentic or privileged local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “有分红” (has dividends) → potentially related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - “屋企有栋有红本子的楼” (has a building with a red ownership certificate at home) → also related to **RL6**, as it refers to asset ownership in the local area

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - These phrases are not just descriptive; they are **presented as markers of status**. The author implies that these are **important indicators of being, or being recognized as, a “local” with deep roots or privilege**.
  - The tone is **assertive and affirmative**, indicating that the author **endorses** these as valid or significant criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both elements are used by the author to **define or signify local identity**, especially a **privileged or rooted form** of local identity.
  - These are **not resisted or described as others’ opinions**; they are **endorsed as valid and meaningful markers**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - These elements align with **RL6**, which involves **economic assets (e.g., property), community dividends, and deep social roots** used to define **authentic or influential local identity**.
  - The author is suggesting that **owning property with formal ownership (red certificate)** and **receiving community dividends** are **key indicators of being a “real” or “rooted” local**.

**Output:**  
RL6"
有祠堂有分红,"** RL3, RL6"," The phrase ""有祠堂有分红"" (literally: ""has ancestral halls and receives dividends"") implies a description of individuals or families who have deep-rooted connections to a local community—both culturally and economically. The author seems to be pointing to certain qualities that distinguish ""true locals"" from others, particularly in the context of rural or semi-rural Chinese communities where clan structures and land-based economic benefits persist.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **祠堂 (ancestral hall):** Strongly linked to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** and possibly **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**. It indicates a long-standing family presence and cultural integration in the area.
  - **分红 (dividends):** Clearly linked to **RL6**, as it refers to economic benefits derived from local resources or community ownership (e.g., village or community dividends), signifying rootedness and social legitimacy.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of ancestral halls suggests a **symbolic and historical rootedness** in the area, indicating that the author sees family heritage and cultural continuity as part of what constitutes a ""local"".
  - The mention of dividends implies **economic integration and social legitimacy**, suggesting that access to local resources and benefits is a marker of being truly ""local"".
  - Together, these elements are not just descriptive but **evaluative**, used to distinguish between those who are fully integrated into the local social fabric and those who are not.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both elements are **endorsed or acknowledged by the author** as characteristics that define a ""local person"" in a deeper, more rooted sense.
  - They are used to **evaluate local identity** not just in terms of birth or residence, but in terms of **historical belonging and economic participation**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is matched by the ancestral hall, which indicates **family historical rootedness**.
  - **RL6** is matched by the mention of dividends, which indicates **depth of social roots and economic status symbolism**.
  - The author implies that **true locals are those who have both long-standing family ties (ancestral presence) and material/economic integration (dividends)** in the community.

**Output:** RL3, RL6"
个人觉得是祖辈都是在广州这边的，然后有祠堂的这种才算，你的这种顶多算新广州人新入户广州，我是广州本地，但是我增城这边的,"**  
RL1, RL3"," The author is asserting a specific standard for what constitutes a ""real local"" in Guangzhou. They emphasize that true ""local people"" are those whose ancestors have been in Guangzhou for generations and who have ancestral halls (祠堂), suggesting a deep-rooted family history in the area. The author contrasts this with the listener, whom they consider a ""new Guangzhou person"" due to more recent migration or household registration. Additionally, the author identifies themselves as a ""local"" from Zengcheng, indicating a **territorial self-identification** within the broader Guangzhou region.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""祖辈都是在广州这边的"" → implies **family historical rootedness** (RL3)
  - ""有祠堂的这种才算"" → implies **family historical rootedness** and **cultural symbols of local identity** (RL3 and possibly RL4)
  - ""顶多算新广州人新入户广州"" → implies **distinction based on migration vs. rootedness**, and possibly **administrative legitimacy** (RL2 and RL3)
  - ""我是广州本地"" → indicates **self-identification as local**, possibly involving **territorial identity** (RL1)
  - ""但是我增城这边的"" → implies **sub-regional identity within Guangzhou**, suggesting a **socially conventional territorial boundary** (RL1)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **ancestral rootedness** and **ancestral hall** (RL3) are **central** to the author's argument. They are used as the **main criterion** to distinguish ""true locals"" from ""newcomers"".
  - The mention of being a ""new Guangzhou person"" or ""new hukou registrant"" (RL2) is **used contrastively** to **exclude** certain people from the ""real local"" category.
  - The author's self-identification as a local from Zengcheng (RL1) suggests that **even within Guangzhou**, there are **sub-regional identities** that matter, and the author is **claiming legitimacy** as a ""true local"" based on that sub-regional identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is **explicitly endorsed** as the **core criterion** for being a ""real local"".
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is **implicitly endorsed** through the author's self-identification as a Zengcheng local, which they use to assert their own local status.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** is **mentioned but resisted** — the author acknowledges administrative criteria (e.g., new hukou) but **does not endorse** them as sufficient for being considered a true local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs a **hierarchical local identity** framework where **true locals** are defined by **multi-generational rootedness** (RL3) and **territorial self-identification** (RL1). The author uses these to **exclude others** from the ""real local"" category and to **affirm their own status** as a ""true local"" from Zengcheng.

**Output:**  
RL1, RL3"
增城是后来并入广州的，甚至连大家口中广义上的广州人都不算贴主要是会说粤语我觉得他可能更适合说自己是广州本地人,"** RL1, RL4"," The author is discussing the identity of people from **Zengcheng** (增城) after its administrative incorporation into **Guangzhou**. The core expressive intent is that **Zengcheng people are not widely perceived as ""true locals"" of Guangzhou**, not because of administrative boundaries, but **because they do not speak Cantonese**, which is a key cultural-linguistic marker of local identity in the broader Guangzhou area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""增城是后来并入广州的"" — This refers to Zengcheng's **administrative incorporation** into Guangzhou, pointing to **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  - ""甚至连大家口中广义上的广州人都不算"" — This indicates a **socially conventional exclusion** from the broader Guangzhou identity, pointing to **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**.
  - ""主要是会说粤语"" — This emphasizes **language** as the **key criterion for being seen as a local**, pointing to **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author notes that Zengcheng was later incorporated into Guangzhou, but **does not endorse** this as the key criterion for being considered a local. Instead, it is used to **contrast** with the actual standard being proposed.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author points out that Zengcheng people are **not considered Guangzhou locals in the broader social perception**, indicating that **administristrative boundaries are not sufficient** to define local identity.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** This is the **core endorsed criterion** — the author suggests that **speaking Cantonese** is what **truly defines a Guangzhou local**, and since Zengcheng people do not, they are not perceived as such.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse RL2** (administrative legitimacy) as the main criterion.
  - The author **implicitly endorses RL1** (socially conventional territorial identity), as they accept that Zengcheng people are not seen as Guangzhou locals in the broader social imagination.
  - The author **explicitly endorses RL4** (cultural-linguistic recognition), identifying **Cantonese language ability** as the **key determinant** of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implies that **administrative boundaries alone do not define local identity**.
  - They accept that **social perception (RL1)** excludes Zengcheng from the Guangzhou local identity.
  - They **explicitly endorse language (RL4)** — specifically **Cantonese** — as the **main determinant** of whether someone is seen as a true local in Guangzhou.

**Output:** RL1, RL4"
是本地人，不是土著，还有些人在那里卜佬卜佬，分红的时候可没见你卜佬,** RL6," The author is asserting their own local identity (""是本地人"") and simultaneously distancing themselves from being ""土著"" (indigenous/native). They also criticize others who are active or conspicuous in daily life (""卜佬卜佬"") but absent or not recognized when it comes to receiving community dividends. This implies the author believes ""true local"" status or recognition is tied to more than just visible presence — it should be based on deeper, possibly institutional or economic, ties to the community.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""是本地人"" — indicates a self-identification as local.
  - ""不是土著"" — suggests a distinction between being ""local"" and being indigenous/native, indicating that local identity is not purely about historical rootedness.
  - ""分红"" (receiving dividends) — points to a material or institutional basis for local recognition, likely tied to community membership or ownership.
  - ""可没见你卜佬"" — critiques those who are visible or active but not recognized in key moments of local benefit distribution, suggesting that visibility alone isn't sufficient for being considered a ""true local"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The author's self-identification as ""本地人"" is central to their argument.
  - The contrast with ""土著"" implies that local identity is not necessarily rooted in being the original inhabitant or having ancestral ties (RL3), but something else.
  - The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) is a key functional element — it is used as a **marker of real belonging**, suggesting that **only those with actual community benefits or institutional recognition** are truly considered local.
  - The critique of others' absence at ""分红"" moments implies that **local identity, as the author sees it, should be based on tangible, institutional or economic markers**, not just social visibility or behavior.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly rejects** RL3 (family historical rootedness) by distinguishing themselves from ""土著"".
  - The author **implicitly endorses** RL6 — depth of social roots & economic status symbolism — as the **main basis for evaluating who is a ""real local""**, using the example of community dividends.
  - There is **no explicit or implicit endorsement** of other RL types (e.g., language, administrative boundaries, etc.).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs a view of ""local identity"" that hinges not on visibility, behavior, or historical rootedness, but on **institutional or economic recognition**, particularly in the form of **community dividends**.
  - This aligns with **RL6**, which focuses on **economic status, social roots, and institutional recognition** (e.g., community dividends, property ownership, influence) as **criteria for defining ""real local"" status**.
  - The author is making a **hierarchical distinction** — those who receive dividends are the ""real"" locals; others are merely present but not recognized.

**Output:** RL6"
补充一下 是光谷东感觉光谷广场那一块交通也是乱糟的,** RL5," The author adds a comment expressing a perception about traffic conditions in a specific local area — ""光谷东"" (East Optics Valley) and ""光谷广场"" (Optics Valley Square). The key expressive intent is a **negative evaluation of the traffic conditions** in these areas, which seems to serve as a **basis for judging the quality or desirability of the area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is ""交通也是乱糟的"" (the traffic is also chaotic/messy). This is a **functional livability evaluation**, directly commenting on transportation infrastructure and urban functionality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase is used to **evaluate the area negatively**, likely as part of a broader judgment about where one would prefer to live or which areas are ""better"" or ""worse"" in terms of local identity or residential quality. Although the term ""local"" is not directly used, the author is **implicitly constructing a standard of what makes an area desirable or representative of a ""good local"" space**, based on traffic conditions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **endorsing the idea that traffic conditions are a valid criterion** for evaluating the quality of a local area, even if indirectly. This aligns with the **RL5** category, which includes **transportation infrastructure as a factor in assessing the value or desirability of a ""local"" area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The statement fits the RL5 definition: the author is **using traffic conditions as a standard to evaluate the quality of a local area**, thus contributing to a broader understanding of what makes a place a ""good"" or ""bad"" part of the local environment.

因为武汉平时只说汉口、武昌、汉阳三镇，区的话很多，比如汉口包含江汉、江岸、硚口、东西湖、等等等等区，在长江以北、汉水以北的地界都属于汉口。武汉是被长江和汉江分割成了3个部分，你说的那些区是行政区划，3镇才是地理说法，你口中的老武汉人没有说错,RL1," The author is affirming that the traditional division of Wuhan into three towns — Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang — reflects a more authentic or commonly accepted geographical and cultural understanding of the city, as opposed to the more recent or administrative division into districts. The author implies that being a “老武汉人” (old/true Wuhan native) involves recognizing and referring to the city in terms of these three traditional towns rather than the administrative boundaries.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of traditional town names (Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang) as the real way locals conceptualize the city.
  - Distinction between administrative districts (江汉, 江岸, etc.) and traditional geographic understanding.
  - Reference to natural geographical features (长江, 汉江) as defining the local spatial identity.
  - Implicit endorsement of traditional mental maps and local terminology.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The use of traditional town names serves to **affirm a socially conventional and historically rooted way of understanding local identity** and spatial belonging.
  - The contrast with administrative boundaries implies that **administrative divisions are secondary or less meaningful** to local identity.
  - The author affirms that **true locals (老武汉人) use the traditional geographic framework**, suggesting that this is a **criterion for authentic local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the traditional mental map of the three towns as the **core of local identity**, aligning with **RL1**.
  - The author **implicitly rejects administrative boundaries** as the main way to define local identity, thus **RL2 is not endorsed**.
  - No mention of **family history, cultural habits, or language**, so **RL3 and RL4 are not present**.
  - No reference to **livability, environment, or economic status**, so **RL5 and RL6 are not relevant**.
  - No mention of **occupation**, so **RL7 is not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly supports **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, by affirming that the traditional division into three towns is the **correct and authentic way** that locals understand the city.
  - This reflects a **long-standing social and historical understanding** of the city’s spatial identity, which is used to distinguish between true locals and others.

**Step 6: Output Result**

住光谷的不敢讲话鄙视链底层,RL1**," The author is expressing a perception of **social hierarchy or identity-based discrimination**, where people living in the **Guanggu area** (光谷) are considered to be at the **bottom of a ""local"" identity-based鄙视链 (disparagement chain)**. This implies a **subjective boundary** being drawn between ""local"" and ""non-local"" identity, with **residents of Guanggu being excluded or looked down upon** in terms of full ""local"" recognition.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""住光谷的"" (those who live in Guanggu): This refers to **residents of a specific area**, and the sentence implies that **residing there is associated with a lower status** in local identity terms.
  *   ""鄙视链底层"" (bottom of the disparagement chain): This indicates that **local identity is being ranked or evaluated**, and **residential location is being used as a criterion** for that evaluation.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The reference to Guanggu residents being at the bottom of a social hierarchy implies that **where one lives plays a key role in determining their perceived authenticity or status as a ""local""**.
  *   The author is **not resisting this standard**, but rather **highlighting its existence as a prevailing perception**. Therefore, the author **implicitly endorses or conveys** that **residential location (and the associated perception of that location)** is a **criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not discussing wealth, quality of life, or job status directly.
  *   The author **does imply that living in Guanggu disqualifies or diminishes one's status as a ""true local""**, thus using **residential location as a symbolic boundary for local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This fits **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, because the author is **implicitly accepting a socially conventional view** that **certain areas (like Guanggu) are not considered ""core"" or ""authentic"" local areas**, and **residents of those areas are symbolically excluded** from the local identity.
  *   The author is not rejecting this view but **pointing out its existence**, which means they are **endorsing or conveying this logic as a real standard used in society**.

**Output: RL1**"
我经常因为我的青普被当成外码,RL4," *   The author is expressing that they are often mistaken for an ""外码"" (outsider) due to their **accent in Putonghua (Mandarin)** — specifically, their ""青普"" (Qingpu accent or local pronunciation in Mandarin).
  *   The author implies that **linguistic features**, specifically accent, are being used by others to judge whether someone is a ""local"" or not.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key element is **""青普"" (Qingpu-accented Mandarin)** — a phonetic or linguistic marker.
  *   The word “被当成” implies that others are using this feature to make a judgment about the speaker's local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **accent** is being used by others (not the author directly) to **exclude** the speaker from being considered a ""local"".
  *   The author does **not explicitly endorse** this as a valid criterion — rather, they are **highlighting that this is a standard used by others** that leads to misidentification.
  *   However, the author **implicitly accepts** that **language/accent is a relevant and commonly used criterion** for determining local identity, even if it leads to misunderstanding.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is not describing a preference, wealth, or infrastructure.
  *   They are pointing out that **linguistic features (accent)** are being used — and are **perceived by the author as playing a role** in defining who is considered a local.
  *   This aligns with **RL4**, which concerns **cultural-linguistic recognition**, especially **accent**, as a criterion for identifying ""local people"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is communicating that **accent (青普)** leads others to misidentify them as an outsider.
  *   This implies that **linguistic features are seen by the author as a relevant standard** (even if flawed) for determining local identity.
  *   Therefore, the text aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as it involves **accent** being used to judge whether someone belongs to the ""local"" group.

There is an entrenched mental map in which areas inside the inner ring are considered truly ""urban"" or ""central"", while areas beyond are seen as suburban or even rural (""皆为村""). This reflects a symbolic boundary-making mechanism rooted in **local identity perception**, not just administrative or economic factors.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author talks about **mental maps** and **symbolic boundaries** (e.g., “内环之外皆为村”, “民众乐园那圈才是汉口核心”) — this points to **RL1**.
  - There is **implicit resistance to administrative or economic criteria**, as the perception persists even when areas like Huangpu Road are economically comparable or superior (e.g., “均房价不是武汉第一” yet 黄浦路 is still seen as suburban). This implies that **economic or administrative indicators are not the author’s endorsed criteria**, so **RL2 and RL5 are not endorsed**.
  - There is **no mention of cultural-linguistic features, family rootedness, occupational symbolism, or social-economic status**, so **RL3, RL4, RL6, and RL7 are not relevant**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **core RL element (RL1)** functions as the **main logic** through which the author explains the **symbolic hierarchy of local identity in Wuhan**, especially in Hankou.
  - The author **does not endorse** using economic indicators (RL5) or administrative boundaries (RL2) to define local identity, even though they acknowledge the economic status of some areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL1** is **explicitly and functionally endorsed** by the author as a **core standard** for defining local identity and distinguishing between ""urban"" and ""suburban"" areas within Wuhan.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly endorses a **socially conventional, historically sedimented understanding of territorial identity**, where **mental maps and symbolic meanings** (e.g., 六渡桥, 友谊路, 江汉路) define what is truly ""local"" or ""central"".
  - This matches the **definition and features of RL1**.

Over time, the author sheds this internalized stigma, embraces their蔡甸identity, and observes that younger people in the city are more open and friendly. There is also a sense of regret about not passing on the蔡甸dialect to their daughter.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""老武汉的土著"" (native Wuhan people)** – suggests a rooted local identity.
  *   **""蔡甸话"" (Caidian dialect)** – clearly a cultural-linguistic marker.
  *   **""小时候总被瞧不起"" (looked down upon as a child)** – indicates a sense of identity differentiation.
  *   **""说蔡甸话，就是一种高高在上的眼神和鄙视感"" (look down on people who speak Caidian dialect)** – implies the use of dialect as a marker of local identity and social hierarchy.
  *   **""大女儿不会说蔡甸话"" (daughter doesn't speak Caidian dialect)** – suggests concern over cultural continuity.
  *   **""不在乎别人的眼神"" (no longer care about others’ looks)** – indicates a rejection of imposed identity standards.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author critiques the idea that speaking a certain dialect or being from a certain area (e.g., central Wuhan vs.蔡甸) determines one's status as a ""true local"".
  *   The蔡甸dialect is **used by others** as a cultural-linguistic marker to distinguish ""true locals"" from others.
  *   The author **rejects** this logic and embraces蔡甸identity proudly.
  *   The author **does not endorse** the use of dialect or territorial identity as a standard for judging who is ""local"" — instead, they resist it.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **does not endorse** any criteria for defining ""local identity"" in this text.
  *   The author **rejects** the use of dialect (RL4) and socially conventional territorial identity (RL1) as standards for local belonging.
  *   There is **no positive endorsement** of any RL criteria.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author critiques the use of dialect (RL4) and territorial identity (RL1) as tools of exclusion.
  *   However, the author **does not endorse** these as valid standards for defining ""local identity"".
  *   There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any RL category as a legitimate basis for local identity.

  - ""属于武汉"" (belongs to Wuhan) → potentially **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**
  - ""一个妈生的"" (same mother) → metaphorical, implies **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
  - ""地铁七号线以后也是要延长到黄陂的"" (Metro Line 7 extension to Huangpi) → potentially **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**
  - ""在外面说我是黄陂人"" (saying I'm from Huangpi outside) → implies **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, though not directly stated
  - No mention of family roots, cultural habits, occupation, or social connections → **RL3, RL6, RL7 not applicable**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The author uses administrative inclusion (""属于武汉"") to argue that Huangpi should be accepted as equally ""local"" as other parts of Wuhan. This supports the idea that administrative belonging legitimizes local identity.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The metaphor ""一个妈生的"" implies a shared origin and thus shared identity, reinforcing the argument that people from Huangpi should not be socially excluded or looked down upon.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability):** Mentioning the Metro extension is not just about convenience—it’s used to argue that Huangpi is improving and thus deserves equal status as a ""local"" area, countering perceptions of it being ""remote"" or ""inferior"".
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic):** Though not explicitly stated, the author implies that being from Huangpi doesn’t cause surprise or discrimination, which indirectly relates to cultural recognition—but it’s not central to the argument.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL2, RL1, RL5** are all used to argue for Huangpi’s legitimacy as part of Wuhan and thus the legitimacy of its residents as ""local"".
  - **RL4** is mentioned but not strongly endorsed as a core identity-defining criterion.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author argues that Huangpi’s **administrative inclusion in Wuhan** (RL2) and **shared regional origin** (RL1) should negate any social discrimination. They also point to **infrastructure improvements like the metro** (RL5) as further evidence of Huangpi’s local legitimacy.

**Output:** RL1, RL2, RL5"
我新洲的，基本不认为自己是武汉人，感觉武汉人也不太看得起我们，我平时都是说行政区划上算武汉人,"**

RL2, RL1"," The author is expressing a sense of **non-identification with the ""Wuhan"" local identity**, despite being **administratively classified as a Wuhan resident**. They imply a distinction between **formal administrative classification** and **felt cultural or social belonging**, and suggest that this distinction is also recognized by others (""Wuhan people don't look down on us much"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""新洲的"" — indicates a sub-local identity within Wuhan.
  *   ""基本不认为自己是武汉人"" — shows a lack of identification with the broader ""Wuhan"" identity.
  *   ""武汉人也不太看得起我们"" — implies a **social boundary or hierarchy** between different local groups.
  *   ""行政区划上算武汉人"" — explicitly references **administrative classification** as a criterion for defining ""Wuhan person"".

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The **administrative criterion (RL2)** is acknowledged by the author as the **official or formal basis** for being considered a Wuhan person.
  *   The **social boundary or hierarchy (RL1)** is implied through the perception of being looked down upon, suggesting that **socially conventional definitions of ""local""** do not fully include 新洲 residents.
  *   The author **does not endorse the administrative classification as a meaningful or accepted local identity**, but recognizes it as a **formal label**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the **administrative boundary (RL2)** as the **official standard**, even if they **personally reject** it emotionally or socially.
  *   The **social boundary or hierarchy (RL1)** is **implied** as a **reason for their lack of identification**, but the author does not **endorse** this as a **valid standard** — rather, they **describe it as a social reality**.
  *   No other RL types (RL3–RL7) are clearly referenced.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's **core viewpoint** is that although they are **administratively classified as a Wuhan person**, they **do not personally identify** as one, likely due to **socially perceived boundaries**. However, they **explicitly acknowledge** that the **administrative classification (RL2)** is the **official standard** used to define who is a Wuhan person.

They contrast their personal attachment and current residence in Gutian with more occasional visits to Roulian (now Tijiao), attributing Gutian’s growing popularity to the development of IKEA and Sam's Club. While expressing hope for the joint development of both areas, the author implicitly conveys a sense of **local identity** tied to **residential history** and **perceived centrality or familiarity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Reference to a **traditional saying** that defines regional identity and spatial cognition: “上有古田，下有肉联” → potentially **RL1**
  - The author lives in **Gutian** and feels a stronger connection to it, implying a sense of belonging formed through **long-term residence** → potentially **RL3**
  - The author associates **Gutian’s development and convenience** (宜家、山姆) with its increasing desirability and “local” appeal → potentially **RL5**
  - There is **no explicit mention** of administrative identity, dialect, occupation, or economic control/social roots, so RL2, RL4, RL6, and RL7 are not applicable.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The saying functions as a cultural and spatial reference point, used by the author to frame the discussion and imply that traditional mental maps still influence how people think about ""local"" identity in the area.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author’s long-term residence in Gutian, contrasted with occasional visits to Tijiao, implies a stronger identification with Gutian, suggesting that **residential duration** affects their sense of local belonging.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author links the **development of commercial facilities** (宜家、山姆) with increased popularity, implying that **livability and convenience** contribute to the area’s “local” identity or desirability.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** any of these elements and **implicitly endorses** them as contributing to their sense of local identity or local value.
  - All three elements (RL1, RL3, RL5) are **used functionally** to define or evaluate local identity or local area value.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1:** The author uses a culturally rooted spatial saying to frame the local identity of areas, indicating that traditional territorial cognition still plays a role in defining “local”.
  - **RL3:** The author’s long-term residence in Gutian implies that **residential history** contributes to a stronger sense of local identity.
  - **RL5:** The author links the area’s commercial development with its rising popularity, implying that **functional livability** affects how “local” an area is perceived.

武汉已经越来越大了，现在黄陂新洲都划进来了,RL2," *   The author is expressing the idea that Wuhan has expanded significantly, to the point where areas like Huangpi and Xinzhou—previously not considered part of the core city—are now incorporated into the broader Wuhan urban area. This implies a **changing perception or boundary of what is considered “local” Wuhan**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase “武汉已经越来越大了” (Wuhan has become bigger and bigger) suggests an evolving perception of the city's spatial and possibly social identity.
  *   “黄陂新洲都划进来了” (Huangpi and Xinzhou have been incorporated) refers to **administrative change**, which may influence the definition of “local” Wuhan identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase about Huangpi and Xinzhou being “划进来” (incorporated) is **central** to the author’s argument about the **changing scope of Wuhan**, and thus, potentially, who counts as a “local”.
  *   This is not a negative or resisted point—it is **presented as a factual and accepted development**, suggesting the author acknowledges or endorses this as part of the evolving definition of “local” in Wuhan.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The **administrative incorporation** of areas is directly linked to the redefinition of “local”.
  *   There is no mention of cultural, linguistic, or generational rootedness playing a role in this specific assertion.
  *   The author is not evaluating the quality of these areas, nor are they discussing social roots or economic status.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** as a criterion to understand or describe the evolving scope of what counts as “local” Wuhan.
  *   This reflects a view that the **official administrative boundary changes** are meaningful in redefining local identity.

家里人是武钢的，记得小时候，一些武昌的亲戚一边羡慕我家人的“铁饭碗”一边嘲笑我是乡里伢。,"** RL1, RL7"," The author recalls a childhood experience where relatives from Wuchang (武昌) both admired their family's secure state job (""铁饭碗"") at Wuhan Iron and Steel (武钢), while also mocking the author as a ""country kid"" (乡里伢). The underlying theme is how identity as a ""local"" was being contested or evaluated based on multiple criteria, particularly **workplace affiliation** and **regional identity**, with an emotional tone of being looked down upon despite having stable employment ties.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""家里人是武钢的"" — Indicates a workplace and likely residential connection to a major industrial employer, possibly implying local status through occupational and community ties. (Potential RL7)
  - ""一些武昌的亲戚"" — Implies a regional identity distinction between the speaker and the relatives from Wuchang. (Potential RL1)
  - ""乡里伢"" — A derogatory term implying rural or non-urban identity, used to exclude the speaker from being considered a ""true local"" of the more prestigious urban area. (Potential RL1)
  - ""铁饭碗"" — Refers to secure employment, which might imply a certain status or legitimacy in society. (Potential RL6 or RL7)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of武钢 (WuSteel) employment serves to show that despite having a prestigious job (which might imply local status or at least economic legitimacy), the author was still socially excluded.
  - The use of ""乡里伢"" and the contrast with Wuchang relatives suggests that **regional identity**, not just economic or occupational status, was a key factor in determining who is considered ""local"" and who is not.
  - The author seems to be critiquing or reflecting on how **local identity is not just about economic standing**, but also about **regional origin and perception**, and how people can be excluded from ""local"" identity despite being deeply embedded in the local economy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not endorse** the idea that武昌 residents are more local — rather, they **highlight the contradiction** between economic legitimacy and social exclusion.
  - The author **implicitly conveys** that **regional identity labels and perceptions (e.g., being called a ""country kid"")** play a significant role in defining who is considered local.
  - The author **does not endorse** the武昌 relatives' view but **uses it to critique the logic** behind how local identity is socially constructed.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The author reflects on how people from Wuchang look down on them as a ""country kid"", indicating that **socially accepted mental maps and regional labels** are used to define local identity.
  - **RL7: Occupational Symbolism** — The mention of ""武钢"" (WuSteel) and ""铁饭碗"" (secure job) implies that **occupational identity** was seen as a marker of status, but **not sufficient** to grant full local identity recognition.

老武汉人觉得很多地方都是乡里，多少年的印象，一下子改不了，我是青山区东北人后代，土生土长的，也被很多汉口人认为偏僻地方的人，我觉得周边的不算正宗武汉人，老观念没办法,"RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing how long-standing **socially conventional** and **subjective regional perceptions** influence the definition of who is considered a ""local"" (正宗武汉人). Despite being a native and lifelong resident of a particular area in Wuhan (青山区), they are still regarded by others (e.g., 汉口人) as coming from a ""remote"" or non-core area. This reflects a **mentally mapped, socially reinforced boundary** of local identity that is resistant to change, even among people born and raised in the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “老武汉人觉得很多地方都是乡里，多少年的印象，一下子改不了” → RL1 (long-standing regional perception)
  - “我是青山区东北人后代，土生土长的” → RL3 (born and raised locally)
  - “也被很多汉口人认为偏僻地方的人” → RL1 (subjective boundary perception)
  - “我觉得周边的不算正宗武汉人” → RL1 (self-reinforced regional boundary perception)
  - “老观念没办法” → RL1 (socially conventional thinking)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 elements** serve as the **main argument**: the author is highlighting how **socially conventional mental maps** shape the definition of who is considered a “true local.” These perceptions are **deeply ingrained**, **resistant to change**, and **continue to socially segregate areas** within the same city.
  - The **RL3 element** (""土生土长"") contrasts with the author's experience of still being considered non-local by others, which **challenges the idea that birth and upbringing alone define local identity**. However, the author does not reject this logic entirely; rather, they accept it **as part of their own identity**, even while acknowledging that it is **not sufficient** to be accepted as “local” by others.
  - The author **does not endorse** administrative, linguistic, or economic criteria. They also do not define “local” purely by cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4), nor do they link economic or occupational status (RL6/RL7) to local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the **RL1 logic**: long-standing, socially conventional mental maps are a **valid and influential** basis for defining local identity.
  - The **RL3 logic** is **acknowledged** by the author as part of their identity but **not sufficient** to be accepted as local by others. However, since the author **does consider themselves local**, and uses their birth and upbringing as part of their identity claim, this criterion is **implicitly endorsed**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s identity struggle reflects a **tension between personal rootedness (RL3)** and **socially conventional mental boundaries (RL1)**. While the author is **born and raised locally (RL3)**, they are still **excluded by others** based on **subjective regional perception (RL1)**, which the author ultimately **accepts as a reality** of local identity construction.

不是，武汉主城区是口音辨别的。只要不是地道汉口话才说是乡里的。黄陂的发音跟武汉人是不一样,RL4," The author is asserting that in Wuhan, one's **local identity** is determined by **linguistic-cultural features**, specifically **accent or dialect** — if someone does not speak the authentic Hankou dialect, they are considered ""from the countryside"". The example of Huangpi pronunciation differing from that of Wuhan residents supports this point.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key elements include:
  - Use of **local dialect (汉口话)** as a marker of identity
  - Distinguishing between **local** and **non-local** based on **accent**
  - Specific mention of **Huangpi pronunciation** being different from Wuhan’s, hence not considered ""local""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses **accent and dialect** as a **symbolic boundary** to distinguish between local Wuhan residents and outsiders. This is not just a cultural observation but a **criterion the author uses or endorses** to define who counts as a ""local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author **explicitly endorses** the use of **language and accent** as the basis for judging ""local"" identity in Wuhan.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author clearly uses **language and accent** as the **key criterion** for determining local identity.

"武汉13个区的GDP排名、未来发展、人口以及房价情况一直备受关注。外地人常认为汉口区是武汉最富有的区，实际上他们说的是江汉区。江汉路步行街、国广武广每日都在刷新武汉的最高消费记录，西北湖的金融圈也是高楼林立。不过，江汉区2024年GDP仅1627亿，在武汉排名第六，房价约15000到3万之间。
 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","** RL1, RL4, RL6"," The author is analyzing the **economic, developmental, and residential value of different districts in Wuhan**, particularly through the lens of **GDP, industry, population, and housing prices**. While the text does not directly define ""local identity"" in terms of who counts as a local person, it **frequently implies that economic vibrancy, population influx, and industrial development are key indicators of a district’s strength and attractiveness**, which in turn may influence **who considers themselves or is seen as part of the ""real"" or ""core"" local area**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **Economic and industrial strength** (光谷的产业优势、人均收入、企业数量等) – RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - **Population influx and youthfulness** (年轻人和外来人口最多) – RL6 (also tied to vitality and local value)
  - **Contrast between old and new districts** (钟家村王家湾衰落 vs. 光谷中心城高楼林立) – RL1 (implied mental map of where ""core"" or ""valuable"" locals might reside)
  - **Housing prices as a proxy for local value and status** – RL6 (economic symbolism)
  - **Historical and cultural landmarks** (江汉路步行街、汉口江滩、老洋房等) – RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition), though not directly tied to dialect or language, it’s about **cultural rootedness and identity markers**
  - **Educational level and talent density** (研究生博士遍地走) – RL6 (economic and social capital)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **economic performance and development** to **rank the districts** and **imply which areas are “core” or “emerging” local areas**.
  - The **contrast between old and new areas** implies a **shifting perception of where the “real” or “valuable” locals are**, indicating a **mental map** (RL1) and **economic legitimacy** (RL6).
  - **Cultural landmarks and historical districts** are mentioned not just for nostalgia, but as **identity anchors** for Wuhan residents — implying that **attachment to these places contributes to a sense of local identity** (RL4).
  - **Housing prices and population movement** are used to **evaluate the desirability and legitimacy of a district as a “local” residential area**, thus contributing to **RL6**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not explicitly define “local people”** but **implicitly defines “ideal local areas”** based on **economic vibrancy, population dynamics, cultural symbolism, and housing value**.
  - These criteria are **used to evaluate which districts are “core” or “valuable”**, and by implication, **who belongs to the “real” local community**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author implies a **mental map of Wuhan**, where certain areas (like Jianghan, Jiang'an, and Optics Valley) are seen as **more central or prestigious**, while others (like Caidian, Hanyang) are seen as **peripheral or declining**.
  - **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)**: While not about dialect, the **cultural landmarks and historical associations** are used to **anchor identity and belonging**, especially in areas like Jiang'an and Jianghan.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: The author repeatedly ties **economic strength, population influx, education level, and housing prices** to **who belongs in the “core” of the city**, implying that **economic and social capital contribute to local identity**.

@🔥 @cwntry 想到xyl说土生土长的水果湖人,RL3," The text ""@🔥 @cwntry 想到xyl说土生土长的水果湖人"" expresses a recollection or association with someone (xyl) describing a person (or themselves) as “土生土长的水果湖人,” which translates to “a native-born Lakers fan from the Inland Empire (‘Fruitland’).” The key idea is that the person being referenced sees themselves — or is seen by others — as having deep-rooted ties to the area, specifically in terms of being born and raised there.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The phrase “土生土长” (literally “born and raised”) is a strong indicator of local identity rooted in personal growth history. It suggests that the person has a long-standing, organic connection to the region.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The phrase is used to affirm or recall someone’s local identity based on their upbringing. It is not negated or resisted by the author but rather recalled with a tone that implies认同 (acknowledgment or认同—认同 needs translation). The author is not critiquing or resisting this criterion but rather referencing it as a valid way to define a “local person.”

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The text clearly endorses the idea that being “born and raised” in a place is a valid basis for claiming local identity. There are no counterarguments or negations of this logic.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as it centers on the idea of “born and raised here” as a basis for local identity.

gdp 再高，跟汉南人有关系？,N/A," *   The author is expressing skepticism or even negation toward the relevance of high GDP to the identity or well-being of ""汉南人"" (people from Hannan). The rhetorical question implies that the author does not see economic indicators like GDP as a meaningful criterion for defining or evaluating ""local people"" or their status.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is ""GDP再高"" (no matter how high the GDP is), which refers to economic performance or wealth.
  *   The phrase ""跟汉南人有关系？"" (does it have anything to do with Hannan people?) implies that the author does **not** believe GDP is a relevant standard for defining or evaluating local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of GDP functions to **reject** the idea that economic performance is a valid or meaningful criterion for defining ""local identity"" or assessing whether someone benefits from or belongs to the area.
  *   The author is **resisting** the use of economic indicators (like GDP) as a standard for local identity or regional evaluation.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly rejects** GDP as a relevant criterion.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of any RL criteria in the text. The author is focused on **negating** GDP as a standard, not affirming any specific RL-based standard.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   GDP is not directly listed as a specific RL category, but it may relate to broader themes of economic or social status.

RL3"," The author is describing a sense of psychological loss and identity crisis among long-standing urban residents (""老市民"") in Wuhan. This sense of loss stems from the perceived erosion of their social status and distinctiveness, as newer migrants—whose ancestors were farmers in rural areas—now live and succeed alongside them in the city. The author seems to imply that this identity distinction used to be based on long-standing urban residency and generational heritage but is now being challenged.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" → suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - ""祖辈都在乡下耕田的外地人"" → contrasts **RL3**, implying that the ""outsiders"" lack this rootedness
  - The contrast in generational background and current status → reinforces **RL3** as a valued identity marker
  - The emotional reaction of ""心理落差"" and ""排外"" → implies a **social boundary** based on **RL3**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses **RL3** to define what it means to be a ""true local"" — someone whose family has been part of the city for generations.
  - This generational distinction is not just historical but functions as a **social legitimacy marker**, giving the ""老市民"" a sense of belonging and superiority.
  - The author implicitly critiques the changing social structure where this traditional criterion is no longer sufficient to maintain status or distinction.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **clearly endorses** **RL3** as a defining feature of ""local identity"".
  - Other criteria (like economic status or cultural habits) are **not explicitly endorsed**; they are mentioned in the background but not framed as the author's own standard for defining ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's argument is grounded in **RL3**, where being a ""local"" is defined by **generational rootedness** in the city.
  - The emotional and social tension described arises from the **challenge to this traditional standard**, as new migrants without this rootedness are gaining equal or better status.
  - Therefore, **RL3** is central to the author’s perception of local identity and the resulting sense of psychological displacement.

**Output:**

经开合并进去了，我前几年就是住的经开，档案上填的就是这个，后来变成汉南了，搞得我很懵啊,** RL2," The author is expressing confusion and perhaps mild frustration over an administrative change — specifically, that ""经开"" (Economic Development Zone, or EDZ) was merged into another district (""汉南"", Hainan District), which affected how they identified their residence administratively. The key point is that the author used to define their local identity in terms of ""经开"", but this was later changed without their clear understanding, implying that **administrative boundaries have a direct impact on how one's local identity is defined or redefined**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""经开合并进去了"" – indicates an administrative merger.
  * ""档案上填的就是这个"" – shows that the author used to officially identify with ""经开"" in formal documentation.
  * ""后来变成汉南了"" – indicates that due to the merger, their local identity changed to ""汉南"".
  * ""搞得我很懵啊"" – expresses confusion due to the change.

  These elements suggest that the author sees their local identity as being tied to **administrative classification**, not just personal or cultural identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The mention of the administrative merger and the change in official documentation play a **central role** in the author’s confusion and narrative. The author implies that **administrative legitimacy (RL2)** — not just personal residence or cultural belonging — is a key determinant of local identity. The confusion stems from the fact that their local identity label was changed not by personal choice or cultural shift, but by **administrative reclassification**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly accepts that **administrative boundaries and classifications** (like district names and affiliations) are used to define local identity, as evidenced by their statement about filling out official documents and the impact of the merger. There is no resistance to this criterion; rather, the author is reacting to the change in how their local identity is officially recognized.

  The author's narrative revolves around the idea that **administrative classification determines local identity** — they lived in a place, identified with it, and had it reclassified, which caused confusion. This directly aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author implicitly accepts that **official administrative divisions and affiliations are used to define who or what counts as local**.

**Output:** RL2"
我土生土长的武汉人，说实话20年前我觉得汉口是武汉最富裕的地方，现在光谷发展的太快了太好了，很多住市区的人跑这边来上班，武汉未来还是看光谷。,"** RL3, RL5, RL6"," *   The author is asserting their identity as a native Wuhan person and expressing a shift in perception regarding which part of Wuhan is most prosperous — from **Hankou** 20 years ago to **Optics Valley (Guanggu)** today. The author believes Guanggu is now the most promising area and where many city dwellers are moving for work.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   “我土生土长的武汉人” — indicates a personal history rooted in Wuhan, possibly linking to **RL3**.
  *   “20年前我觉得汉口是武汉最富裕的地方” — reflects a past perception of economic or social center, possibly linking to **RL6** or **RL5**.
  *   “现在光谷发展的太快了太好了” — indicates current economic or infrastructural development, possibly linking to **RL5** or **RL6**.
  *   “很多住市区的人跑这边来上班” — indicates migration for work and economic pull, possibly linking to **RL6** or **RL5**.
  *   “武汉未来还是看光谷” — implies Guanggu is the future standard of ""good local area"", linking to **RL5** or **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL3** (""我土生土长的武汉人"") — Establishes the author's **authenticity and rootedness** in Wuhan, giving them the authority to evaluate local development and identity.
  *   **RL5** (""光谷发展的太快了太好了"", ""很多住市区的人跑这边来上班"", ""武汉未来还是看光谷"") — Used to argue that Guanggu is now the **ideal local area** due to its development, convenience, and attractiveness — functional livability and environmental quality.
  *   **RL6** (implied through ""发展太快太好"", ""很多人来上班"") — Suggests economic pull and social influence, indicating Guanggu as the new **center of local social and economic rootedness**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly endorses **RL3** (own rootedness), **RL5** (development and livability as markers of a ""good local area""), and **RL6** (economic pull and influence as markers of local status).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author, as a native Wuhan person (RL3), evaluates local identity and local quality not based on traditional emotional or cultural ties (e.g., Hankou), but based on current **functional development and livability** (RL5), and **economic and social pull** (RL6). These are the standards they use to define where the ""real"" or ""future"" local center of Wuhan lies.

黄陂比新洲强多了，机场也在黄陂，人家物流商品市场，文旅游做得火爆。还有两条地铁线路。把阳逻剁有了，新洲只剩下在哪遥远偏僻的小山村啦,"** RL1, RL2, RL5"," The author is comparing two regions—黄陂 (Huangpi) and 新洲 (Xinzhou)—and clearly expressing the view that Huangpi is superior. The superiority is framed in terms of infrastructure (airport, metro lines), economic development (logistics, commodity markets), and cultural tourism. The author implies that these factors make Huangpi more ""local"" in the sense of being central, developed, and integrated, while Xinzhou is marginalized and peripheral.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""机场也在黄陂"" (The airport is also in Huangpi)** – Suggests economic and infrastructural centrality.
  - **""物流商品市场，文旅游做得火爆"" (Logistics, commodity markets, and cultural tourism are booming)** – Indicates economic and cultural vibrancy.
  - **""还有两条地铁线路"" (There are also two metro lines)** – Infrastructure and urban integration.
  - **""把阳逻剁有了"" (Yangluo has been annexed)** – Implies administrative or territorial expansion.
  - **""新洲只剩下在哪遥远偏僻的小山村啦"" (Xinzhou is left with only remote, secluded villages)** – Suggests geographic and developmental marginalization.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **infrastructure and economic development** (airport, metro, logistics, tourism) are used to **argue that Huangpi is more central and developed**, thus more representative of the ""local"" urban core.
  - The **mention of Yangluo being annexed** implies **administrative legitimacy** and expansion of Huangpi’s influence.
  - The **contrast with remote villages in Xinzhou** implies a **territorial and developmental boundary** between what is considered central/local and what is peripheral/less local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is clearly using **developmental and infrastructural indicators** to define what areas are considered more ""local"" or central.
  - They also imply that **administrative changes (annexation of Yangluo)** contribute to Huangpi’s local centrality.
  - There is an **implicit territorial boundary** that excludes remote or underdeveloped areas (like Xinzhou) from being considered truly ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly defines a mental map where Huangpi is central and Xinzhou is peripheral. The developmental contrast is used to symbolize this territorial hierarchy.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy):** The mention of Yangluo being ""annexed"" implies that administrative changes are seen as legitimizing Huangpi’s expanded local identity.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** Infrastructure (airport, metro), logistics, and tourism are used as standards to judge the ""quality"" of a local area, with Huangpi being superior.

**Output:** RL1, RL2, RL5"
最早划分行政区的确是这样的。除了最早的中山路开元，其他的都叫做“郊区”，是行政意义上的郊区。,"**

RL2"," The author is expressing that the original administrative division of the area was such that only the earliest developed area (中山路开元, Zhongshan Road Kaiyuan) was considered the core or ""urban"" part, while all other areas were classified as ""suburbs"" in administrative terms. This implies a historical administrative logic behind defining what was considered ""local"" or central versus peripheral.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “最早的行政区划分” (earliest administrative division) and “行政意义上的郊区” (suburbs in administrative terms) point to **administrative criteria** being used to define local identity or local area boundaries.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is not criticizing or resisting this classification but is **describing it as a foundational or historical administrative logic** used to define what counts as ""local"" (urban/core) and what is ""non-local"" (suburban/peripheral).
  - The key function of this statement is to **establish that administrative definitions historically played a role in determining local identity boundaries**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **endorsing or at least affirming the relevance of administrative division logic** in defining the scope of ""local"" areas.
  - There is no mention of cultural, economic, or social rootedness, nor is there any implication that the author rejects administrative classification.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - This fits **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author refers to historical administrative divisions (e.g., what is considered ""urban"" vs. ""suburban"") as a basis for defining the scope and identity of ""local"" areas.

**Step 6: Output Result**

海沧、集美、同安现在属于厦门地区。但历史上厦门属于它们，它们不属于厦门。历史上的厦门确实只指中山路一带的老市区，因为厦门城在那里。至于翔安…对厦门人来说翔安就是同安的一部分呀,RL1," The author is expressing a historical and cultural understanding of what constitutes ""Xiamen"" or ""local Xiamen people"", emphasizing that the current administrative boundaries do not align with historical or cultural perceptions. The author implies that ""real Xiamen"" is limited to the old urban core (Zhongshan Road area), and that areas like Haicang, Jimei, Tong'an, and Xiang'an were historically separate and thus not ""truly"" part of Xiamen in terms of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Historical perception of ""Xiamen"" being limited to the old city area.
  - Mention of administrative changes where these areas were ""incorporated"" into Xiamen.
  - The statement that historically, ""Xiamen belonged to them, not the other way around"".
  - The idea that ""Xiamen people"" do not consider Xiang’an as separate from Tong’an, suggesting a cultural or social boundary.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The historical and cultural perception of where ""Xiamen"" originally was plays a **central role** in defining who the ""real locals"" are.
  - The administrative change is **not accepted as sufficient** to redefine local identity; it is contrasted with the historical and cultural understanding.
  - The author **resists the idea** that administrative inclusion equates to cultural or historical belonging.
  - The statement about Xiang’an and Tong’an reflects a **socially conventional boundary** and **cultural perception** of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** a historically rooted, culturally defined boundary of local identity.
  - The author **implicitly rejects** administrative legitimacy (RL2) as the sole basis for defining local identity.
  - The author **supports** a socially conventional territorial identity (RL1) and possibly cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4), though RL4 is not directly stated.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author constructs a narrative that **""local"" Xiamen identity is based on historical and conventional territorial understanding**, not administrative boundaries.
  - This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as the author defines ""local"" based on long-standing cultural and historical perceptions of where Xiamen ""really"" is.
  - The author also **implies** a cultural boundary by distinguishing between ""Xiamen people"" and others, which could be interpreted as **RL4**, though it is not directly linked to language or cultural habits.

经济特区一开始只有湖里的一小部分好像，当时厦门岛还分4个区，经济特区扩大到全岛，后来建设海湾型城市，把集美，海沧，同安，翔安，并到厦门市，就把岛内的鼓浪屿区和开元区合并到思明区了。所以并不是有些人说的什么“集美同安为什么就不是厦门”“你们是在优越什么”，而是人家集美就有自己的名字，那么多年人家就是集美人，灌口人，这样的由来。海湾型城市之后就是岛内外6个区了。,"RL1, RL2, RL3"," The author is explaining the historical evolution of administrative boundaries and regional identities within Xiamen, particularly emphasizing that areas like Jimei and Tong'an have their own long-standing identities and should not be dismissed as ""not Xiamen."" The author is defending the legitimacy of local identities outside the island core and resisting the idea that only certain areas (e.g., Siming) represent ""real"" Xiamen.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of administrative changes: expansion of the Special Economic Zone, merging of districts (Gulangyu and Kaiyuan into Siming), and the inclusion of Jimei, Haicang, Tong’an, and Xiang’an into Xiamen.
  - Emphasis on historical rootedness: “那么多年人家就是集美人，灌口人” (for so many years, they were Jimei people, Guankou people).
  - Defense of local identity: “集美就有自己的名字” (Jimei has its own name), suggesting symbolic and cultural recognition.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Administrative boundary changes** are used to show that the definition of what is ""Xiamen"" has evolved over time and that areas like Jimei and Tong’an are now part of the city.
  - **Historical rootedness** is used to assert that people from Jimei and Guankou have long-standing local identities that are legitimate and should not be dismissed.
  - **Symbolic recognition** of place names and identities is used to counter a perceived hierarchy or exclusionary attitude toward certain districts.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** by referencing the administrative expansion and reorganization of districts as a basis for defining what is “Xiamen.”
  - The author also clearly endorses **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** by emphasizing that people have long-standing identities tied to specific areas (Jimei, Guankou).
  - The author implicitly endorses **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** by defending the symbolic meaning and recognition of local identities and place names.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2** is present because the author refers to administrative changes and the official inclusion of areas like Jimei and Tong’an into Xiamen, using this as a basis to argue that they are indeed part of the city.
  - **RL3** is present because the author emphasizes the long-standing identity of people from Jimei and Guankou, implying that this rootedness qualifies them as “local.”
  - **RL1** is present because the author resists the idea that only certain areas are “Xiamen” and instead defends the conventional and symbolic recognition of multiple local identities within the city.

好家伙 我以为厦门岛内房价应该不会太高 想着看看 结果一看 嗯～跟上海也差不多,None," *   The author expresses surprise at厦门 (Xiamen) island's housing prices being comparable to Shanghai's, implying a personal realization that the cost of living or real estate value in Xiamen is higher than expected.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key focus is on **housing prices** being compared to Shanghai — a major city — suggesting an implicit evaluation of Xiamen’s **functional livability or environmental quality** based on real estate value.
  *   No explicit mention of local identity, belonging, dialect, hukou, growth history, or other typical RL markers.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The housing price comparison functions as a **personal observation about economic value and urban scale**, not as a standard for defining ""local identity"".
  *   The author is not using housing price as a **criterion to judge who is a local** or to define the **local area’s identity or boundaries**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   While RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition) might include housing prices as a potential factor, in this case, the author is **not evaluating or defining “local” areas** based on this. They are **merely surprised by the price level**, not using it as a standard for local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The text contains no endorsement or implicit suggestion of any criteria for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating local areas in a symbolic or social sense.
  *   The housing price is used only to express **economic comparison**, not tied to **identity, belonging, or area evaluation in the sense of RL**.

我小时候 只有这个区域我们理解为厦门，其他我们称之为岛外。但随着现在资源拓宽厦门理解的更广了。,RL1**," The author is expressing a change in how ""Xiamen"" is cognitively defined — from a narrower, childhood understanding (limited to a specific core area) to a broader, current perception (encompassing more areas). This reflects a **shift in socially conventional territorial identity**, shaped by resource expansion and changing perceptions.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""小时候 只有这个区域我们理解为厦门"" → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - ""其他我们称之为岛外"" → RL1 (Mental map and boundary cognition)
  - ""随着现在资源拓宽厦门理解的更广了"" → RL1 (Change in social perception and boundary cognition due to development)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  These elements function to illustrate how the **socially accepted understanding of what constitutes ""Xiamen""** has evolved over time. The author is not resisting this change but is describing it as a natural cognitive shift, indicating implicit acceptance or acknowledgment of the new, broader definition.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The entire passage revolves around the **evolving mental map and cognitive boundary of ""Xiamen""**, which is a core aspect of **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**. The author is not using administrative, cultural, or economic criteria — the focus is purely on the changing perception of which areas ""count"" as local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author's argument centers on how the **socially conventional understanding of local identity (RL1)** has shifted. The distinction between ""this area is Xiamen"" and ""that area is outside the island"" reflects a traditional, emotionally grounded, and socially shared territorial cognition. The expansion of this understanding due to resource development further supports the idea that the author sees local identity as shaped by evolving social conventions.

They also imply that despite lower overall wages, Xiamen remains an attractive place to live, especially for locals who own property and may return after studying or living elsewhere.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mentions of returning to Xiamen after studying or living elsewhere → possibly related to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - Importance of property ownership in Xiamen → possibly related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - Positive evaluation of environment, education, transportation, and medical resources → possibly related to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **Returning after studying/living elsewhere**: Suggests a rootedness or emotional connection to Xiamen, implying that locals have a tendency or desire to come back, reinforcing a sense of local identity.
  - **Owning property in Xiamen**: Implies a material basis for local identity and stability, contributing to the author's view that locals prefer to stay or return.
  - **Praise for livability factors**: Used to argue that Xiamen is a high-quality local area, supporting the idea that it is a desirable ""local"" place to live, especially in comparison to other cities.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The idea of returning to Xiamen after being away implies that local identity is tied to a personal history or emotional connection to the city.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: The author clearly uses livability and environmental quality as criteria to define Xiamen as a ""good local area"" and to justify its value as a place people want to return to.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**: Property ownership is implied as a factor that gives locals a stake in the city and a reason to stay or return.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3**: The author suggests that many locals, after leaving for education or work, still desire to return to Xiamen, indicating that personal or family rootedness plays a role in local identity.
  - **RL5**: The author praises Xiamen's environment, education, transportation, and medical resources, using these factors to define it as a high-quality ""local"" place, which contributes to its attractiveness and the desire of locals to return.
  - **RL6**: Property ownership is implied as a key factor in locals' ability and desire to return to Xiamen, indicating that economic ties and asset ownership contribute to a stable local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

@Zchi 厦门房价这么高？,RL6," The text is a rhetorical question implying that the high housing prices in Xiamen are a reason to doubt or deny someone's local identity. The author's core expressive intent is to **associate the high cost of housing with the authenticity or legitimacy of being a ""local"" person** — implying that if someone truly belonged, they wouldn't be priced out.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   High housing prices (厦门房价这么高) — potentially linked to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), as housing ownership or economic status is implied to be a marker of local identity.
  *   Implicit assumption that locals should be able to afford housing — again pointing toward **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of high housing prices is not just an economic observation; it functions as a **criterion for evaluating who can be considered a ""real local""** — only those who can afford or remain in such areas are seen as authentic locals.
  *   The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that economic status (especially the ability to afford housing in a high-cost area) is a standard by which local identity is judged.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Only **RL6** is relevant here, as the author implies that **economic status and housing affordability** are valid criteria for determining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author links high housing prices to the legitimacy of local identity, suggesting that only those who can afford to live in Xiamen are ""real locals"". This aligns with **RL6**, where economic status and asset ownership (like housing) are used to judge the stability, authenticity, or hierarchy of local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL6"
听说厦门的房价都是隔壁市区的富商炒起来的,None," *   The author is suggesting that the high housing prices in Xiamen are driven by wealthy businessmen from neighboring districts. This implies a critique of external economic forces impacting the local real estate market, but it does **not** directly define or evaluate who counts as ""local"" or what makes a place ""local."" The focus is on **economic behavior affecting property prices**, not on identity criteria.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""隔壁市区的富商"" (wealthy businessmen from neighboring districts) — could potentially imply **RL1** (territorial identity), **RL2** (administrative identity), or **RL6** (economic status symbolism).
  *   ""房价...炒起来"" (housing prices are inflated) — relates to economic behavior and property speculation, possibly **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of ""wealthy businessmen from neighboring districts"" serves to **blame external actors** for rising property prices, not to define local identity or affirm local belonging.
  *   The focus is on **economic impact**, not on symbolic or identity-based criteria for being considered local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author does **not** propose or endorse any criteria for defining ""local identity"" — they are **not** saying that being a local is defined by territory, lineage, culture, or economic status.
  *   The text is **not** constructing a definition of ""local people"" or evaluating the quality of a local area based on identity criteria — it's expressing a **cause-effect** observation about real estate prices.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   Although economic actors and external territorial groups are mentioned, the author does **not** use these to define or evaluate ""local identity"" or ""local area quality.""
  *   Therefore, **no RL category applies** because the text does not meet the task's criteria of defining or evaluating ""local identity"" from the author's perspective.

The author implicitly defines “localness” through **lived experience and upbringing in a specific area**, and **not merely through property ownership or migration-based settlement**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “我和我小学初中同学们在青秀区土生土长从小到大” → clearly indicates **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  - “东盟商务区那边大多是新南宁人吧” → implies a contrast between “new” and “old” residents, which could be linked to **RL3** and potentially **RL1** if there's an implied identity boundary.
  - “反而是高中后有部分乡镇来这边买房定居或读书的同学优越感爆棚” → the author **rejects** property ownership or recent settlement as valid criteria for claiming local status, thus **not RL6**.
  - No mention of dialect, accent, or cultural habits → **RL4** not present.
  - No mention of administrative boundaries, hukou, or legal definitions → **RL2** not present.
  - No reference to occupational identity → **RL7** not present.
  - No mention of environmental or functional quality of the area as a reason for local pride → **RL5** not present.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3** is central: the author grounds their sense of belonging in **long-term, generational upbringing in 青秀区**, which they contrast with “newcomers”.
  - **RL1** is **not directly endorsed** — although there is a sense of boundary, the author does not define or affirm a socially conventional territorial identity; rather, it's a **byproduct of RL3 logic**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL3** is explicitly and positively endorsed by the author as a **core standard for defining “local identity”**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that being “local” is defined by **being born and raised in a place (青秀区)** and having **long-term, rooted personal and peer history** there. This aligns with **RL3**.
  - The author **rejects** the idea that recent migration, property ownership, or educational relocation (as seen in some乡镇 students) should confer any sense of superiority or local status — thus **excluding RL6 and RL2**.

青秀区以前不就是大农村吗小时候在埌西，西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷，后面一几年到东盟商务区买房，也是几千块一平而已,"** RL1, RL5, RL6"," The author is reflecting on how the perception of certain areas — specifically 青秀区 (Qingxiu District) — has changed over time. Initially seen as rural and poor (even by people from 西乡塘, another district), the area later became a desirable location with the development of the 东盟商务区 (China-ASEAN Business District), although property prices were still relatively low. The author is suggesting that the concept of ""local"" or ""urban"" is not static and is influenced by broader social and economic transformations.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “青秀区以前不就是大农村吗” — implies a **change in social perception** of the area’s status, once seen as rural.
  - “西乡塘的同学都觉得我家穷” — reflects **social perception and identity-based distinctions** between areas.
  - “东盟商务区买房” — indicates **functional development and livability improvements**.
  - “也是几千块一平而已” — indirectly suggests that the area was still not seen as a high-status or highly desirable ""core local"" area despite development.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The contrast between ""大农村"" and later development into a business district shows that **local identity and area perception are dynamic and influenced by urbanization**.
  - The mention of classmates from another district seeing the area as poor implies a **social ranking of areas** and how that contributes to identity.
  - The development of the business district and relatively low housing prices suggest that **functional livability and economic symbolism** play a role in how areas are valued and how ""local"" identity is constructed.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is not opposing these criteria; they are using them to **illustrate how ""local"" identity is not fixed**, but shaped by **historical perception**, **area development**, and **social ranking**.
  - The author implicitly conveys that **area perception (RL1)**, **functional development (RL5)**, and **social ranking (RL6)** are used by people to define ""local"" identity and evaluate area status.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implies that 青秀区 used to be seen as rural and not truly part of the ""urban local"" core, reflecting conventional territorial perceptions.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The transformation into a business district and the mention of housing prices suggest that **functional development and economic valuation** influence how people judge whether an area is ""local"" or not.
  - **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The author notes that people from other districts saw the area as poor, suggesting that **economic status and social perception** are criteria used to judge local identity.

**Output:** RL1, RL5, RL6"
所以说啊，青秀区土著能有啥优越感啊，我小时候在医科大那边，去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑,"** RL1, RL3"," The author is **challenging the notion of superiority among ""natives"" of Qingxiu District** (青秀区土著), implying that such a sense of superiority is unfounded. They support this by sharing their personal experience of growing up in another area (医科大那边) and frequently going to 朝阳/西乡塘 for leisure, suggesting that **""local identity"" is not exclusive or inherently superior**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""青秀区土著"" — RL3 (implies native/local identity based on being born and raised in the area)
- ""小时候在医科大那边"" — RL3 (personal growth history in a specific area)
- ""去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑"" — RL1 (implies a mental map or regional hierarchy where Qingxiu is not the center or most attractive area)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- RL3 (青秀区土著): The author references the idea of ""natives"" of Qingxiu District, which could imply rootedness or local identity. However, they immediately **undermine** this by showing that even they, from a different area, had to go elsewhere for leisure, **questioning the legitimacy of any superiority**.
- RL3 (小时候在医科大那边): The author uses their own rootedness in another area to **challenge the exclusivity or superiority of Qingxiu natives**, positioning themselves as someone with a different local background.
- RL1 (去玩逛街都得往朝阳西乡塘跑): This implies a **mental map** where Qingxiu is not the center of activity or attractiveness, thereby **challenging the assumed symbolic or social dominance** of Qingxiu natives.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **does not endorse** Qingxiu natives' superiority (RL3), but they do **use the concept of local rootedness (RL3)** to compare and challenge that notion.
- The author **uses their own rootedness (RL3)** and **mental map of regional attractiveness (RL1)** to **deconstruct the symbolic boundary-making** of local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author's **personal rootedness in another area (RL3)** and the **mental map of movement between areas (RL1)** are used to **question the legitimacy of symbolic boundaries and superiority claims** by Qingxiu natives.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
朝阳广场的人流大而且确实鱼龙混杂啊，但是正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好,RL1," The author is expressing the idea that although the crowd at Chaoyang Square is large and mixed in terms of demographics, a ""true Nanning native"" would not say that Chaoyang is a bad area. This implies that the author believes local identity (being a ""true Nanning person"") is linked to a certain kind of evaluative stance — one that shows emotional or cultural attachment to a place despite its drawbacks.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""正宗南宁人"" (authentic Nanning native): suggests a rooted local identity, potentially linking to RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness).
  - The idea that ""正宗南宁人肯定不会说朝阳不好"" (a true Nanning native would never say Chaoyang is bad): implies an emotional or cultural identification with the area, suggesting that local identity includes a loyalty or positive evaluation of certain areas regardless of objective conditions. This aligns with RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), as it reflects a conventional or emotionally rooted identification with a place.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - ""正宗南宁人"" functions as a contrast between outsiders (who may criticize Chaoyang) and insiders (who do not). It reinforces the idea that being a ""true local"" involves a kind of loyalty or identification with certain areas, regardless of their actual condition.
  - The refusal to criticize Chaoyang is not based on objective quality (e.g., it being crowded or chaotic), but on a sense of belonging and identity, which is a key function of RL1.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that ""true locals"" do not criticize certain areas — this is used as a **criterion for defining local identity**.
  - This logic is based on **emotional and social identification with the area**, not administrative, economic, or functional criteria.
  - Therefore, only **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** qualifies.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that being a ""true local"" (正宗南宁人) involves identifying with and defending certain areas emotionally, regardless of their objective characteristics (e.g., being crowded or mixed).
  - This reflects a **socially conventional and emotionally rooted identification** with certain places, which is a key feature of RL1.

西乡塘很多城中村，朝阳广场附近的地铁站就有好几个站点是城中村，建筑大部分是新旧混杂，没有青秀五象的城建新，但是人多，热闹，图生活方便的话住这里挺好的，毕竟什么动物园火车站朝阳都在这里。,RL5," *   The author is describing the characteristics of the Xixiangtang (西乡塘) area, comparing it to other urban areas like Qingxiu and Wuxiang. They highlight the presence of many urban villages, older infrastructure, and a mix of old and new buildings. However, they also point out the area's advantages: convenience, vibrancy, and proximity to key facilities like the zoo, train station, and Chaoyang area. The tone is evaluative but not overtly negative — the author seems to accept the area's condition but presents it as a trade-off between modernity and convenience.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""西乡塘很多城中村""** — This describes the physical and social condition of the area, but not necessarily a criterion for defining ""local identity"".
  *   **""朝阳广场附近的地铁站就有好几个站点是城中村""** — Mentions metro stations, which might relate to RL5 (livability), but used more to illustrate the urban structure, not to define local identity.
  *   **""建筑大部分是新旧混杂""** — Urban aesthetics or development level, possibly RL5, but not directly linked to defining ""local people"".
  *   **""没有青秀五象的城建新""** — Comparison with newer urban areas, possibly RL5, but more about infrastructure quality than identity.
  *   **""但是人多，热闹""** — Implies population density and social activity, possibly RL6 (social rootedness), but not clearly linked to identity.
  *   **""图生活方便的话住这里挺好的""** — Strong RL5 indicator: functional livability used as a standard for residential choice.
  *   **""毕竟什么动物园火车站朝阳都在这里""** — Again, emphasizes convenience and accessibility — RL5.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author's main evaluative point is that although Xixiangtang is not as modern or developed as Qingxiu or Wuxiang, it is still a good place to live if one values convenience and accessibility. The criteria used to evaluate the area as ""good for living"" are based on **functional livability** — access to metro stations, proximity to major facilities, and general convenience.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The only RL category clearly endorsed by the author and used to evaluate the area as ""good"" or ""worth living in"" is **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.
  *   The author is not defining who is a ""local person"" in terms of identity, but rather what makes an area a ""good local area"" — which fits the RL5 definition.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author evaluates Xixiangtang not based on cultural, historical, or administrative criteria, but on its **functional livability** — the presence of metro stations, proximity to key facilities (zoo, train station), and general convenience. These are used as **standards for residential choice** and to **evaluate the area's quality**, which aligns with RL5.

不同区域的街头人群确实迥异，我来南宁生活十多年了，住的地方人流量相对低，平常上班下班很少逛街，最多去去附近万象城盛天地之类的。某次突发奇想坐地铁去朝阳广场（几年没去了），总记得那次的感觉。出地铁看到密密麻麻的人群，都还是年轻人居多，感觉城市非常有朝气，觉得很开心。,N/A," *   The author is describing their personal experience of visiting different areas in Nanning and noticing differences in the character of the crowds and the atmosphere. The main point being conveyed is a **positive emotional response to the vitality and youthful energy** observed in the朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square) area, in contrast to their more low-key residential area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - Mentions of specific locations: 朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square),万象城盛天地 (MixC and Shengtian), and the author’s residential area.
  *   - Observation of crowd density and demographic composition (young people).
  *   - Emotional reaction to the atmosphere of Chaoyang Square — ""感觉城市非常有朝气，觉得很开心"" (""felt the city was very energetic and felt happy"").
  *   - Use of public transport — taking the metro to Chaoyang Square.
  *   - Time-based contrast — “几年没去了” (""haven't been there for several years"").

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   - The **mention of different locations** and the author’s **emotional reaction** to the atmosphere in Chaoyang Square serves to highlight a **subjective appreciation for urban vitality**.
  *   - The **crowd and youthfulness** are symbolic of **urban energy and modernity**, which the author associates positively with the **""ideal"" city vibe**.
  *   - The **use of metro** is not framed as a judgment of local identity, but rather as a means of accessing a place with a desired atmosphere.
  *   - The **contrast with the author’s own area** (low foot traffic, not much shopping) is used to emphasize the difference in urban experience, but not to define ""localness"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not explicitly or implicitly defining who is “local”** or setting boundaries for “local” areas.
  *   The **positive emotional response to crowd and youthfulness** is about **personal preference** and **urban atmosphere**, not about **identity, administrative belonging, rootedness, cultural markers, or economic status**.
  *   There is **no indication** that the author is using these observations to **define “local people”** or to **evaluate the legitimacy or value of a local area** in terms of identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   None of the RL categories apply because the author is not defining or evaluating “local identity” or “local areas” in terms of criteria like **territorial identity, administrative legitimacy, rootedness, language, livability, social roots, or occupation**.
  *   The text is a **personal reflection on urban atmosphere and emotional experience**, not a statement on **who counts as local** or **what makes a place truly local**.

别搞青秀区全区，我寻思着小时候住星湖路的从来没说过别的地方破，毕竟我们自己的房子也挺破。,"RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a personal reflection on how people who grew up in a certain area (星湖路) do not necessarily look down on other places, even though their own living conditions (""our own house was pretty run-down"") were not good. The key idea is that **residents of a place do not automatically consider other areas inferior**, and that **shared local experience (even humble) fosters a kind of local认同 (recognition/affinity) that resists external judgment of other areas as ""破"" (run-down)**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""小时候住星湖路"" (grew up on Xinghu Road)** → suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - **""青秀区全区"" (entire Qingxiu District)** → implies a broader territorial identity or boundary definition → **RL1**
  - **""别的地方破"" (other places are run-down)** and **""我们自己的房子也挺破"" (our own house was also run-down)** → suggests **not using environmental quality as a standard** → implies **RL5 is rejected**
  - The author implies that **local identity is not defined by the quality of the area**, but rather by **shared lived experience**, so **RL5 is not endorsed**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1 (Territorial Identity):** The mention of Qingxiu District as a whole and the distinction between areas (some seen as ""破"") shows that the author is engaging with the idea of **territorial boundaries and identity segmentation**. The author is implicitly **resisting a simplistic division** that labels some parts of the district as inferior.
  - **RL3 (Growth History):** The author emphasizes **growing up in a specific place** (""小时候住星湖路"") as the basis for a kind of **shared local identity**, which leads to **not judging other areas as inferior**, even if one's own area was not ideal. This **personal growth history is central to the author's sense of local belonging** and informs their attitude toward other places and people.
  - **RL5 (Environmental Quality):** The author **explicitly refutes** the idea that environmental quality or infrastructure (like house conditions) should be used to judge areas or people. They are **not using RL5 criteria** to define local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL1** is endorsed in the sense that the author is engaging with the **concept of Qingxiu District as a territorial identity unit**, even if they are **resisting a hierarchical view** of its internal parts.
  - **RL3** is clearly endorsed: the **author's own growth history in a specific local area** is the **basis of their local identity**, and it shapes their **non-judgmental view of other areas**.
  - **RL5** is **explicitly rejected**: the author **does not use environmental quality or house condition** as a standard for judging local identity or area quality.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author’s **core argument** is that **growing up in a certain place (星湖路)** fosters a **shared local identity** that **resists external or hierarchical judgments** of other areas as inferior. This is rooted in **RL3 (growth history)**. The author also engages with the broader **territorial identity of Qingxiu District (RL1)**, suggesting that **local identity is not defined by which part of the district one is from**, but rather by **shared lived experience**.

The author contrasts this with their own upbringing in a different part of Nanning (建政路, Jianzheng Road), which they humorously refer to as being from a ""mountain旮旯"" (remote, rural area). The author clearly **rejects the legitimacy** of using certain criteria to claim ""local superiority"" and implies that such claims are narrow-minded and based on flawed logic.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The phrase “我们家是南宁本地人哦” (We are native Nanning people) implies a **claim of local identity**.
  - The location mentioned — 亭洪供电局下来一点，某桥底下 — refers to a **specific geographic area**.
  - The speaker grew up in 建政路一代 and contrasts that with the other area, suggesting a **comparison of growth histories**.
  - The tone implies that the ""local identity"" claimed by the elderly couple is based on **superficial or invalid criteria**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The elderly woman's claim of being ""本地人"" (local) is used by the author to **highlight a flawed understanding of local identity**.
  - The geographic reference is used to **question the symbolic value** of certain areas in defining ""local"".
  - The author's own background (grew up in 建政路) is used to **undermine the legitimacy** of the other group’s claim to local identity, suggesting that **mere residence or birthplace isn't sufficient**.
  - The tone of mockery implies that **none of the conventional RL criteria are valid** in defining superior ""localness"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author does **not endorse** any of the RL criteria. Instead, they **reject** them as expressions of **narrow-mindedness** and **false superiority**. However, the **text implicitly discusses** these criteria as being **used by others**, and the author **responds to them**, which is enough to justify annotation.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** — The elderly woman implies that living in a certain part of Jiangnan (亭洪供电局附近) makes one a ""true local"", which reflects a socially conventional, if misguided, understanding of territorial belonging.
  - **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** — The elderly woman's statement implies that **family rootedness** in the area (and possibly multi-generational residence) is the basis for claiming local identity.
  - **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition** — Not explicitly present. The author doesn’t mention dialect or cultural habits.
  - **RL2, RL5, RL6, RL7** — Not directly relevant or endorsed by the author.

本南宁人小时候都是喜欢跟朋友约朝阳玩啊，只是后来长大了，能选择的地方也多了，朝阳又越来越难停车（小车和电车都难），所以才去的少了,"** `RL1, RL3`"," The author is expressing a personal and shared local experience of growing up in Nanning — specifically, how locals (like the author) used to commonly gather with friends at Chaoyang (likely referring to a local landmark or district, possibly Chaoyang Plaza or similar) during childhood. As they grew older and had more choices, and as Chaoyang became increasingly inconvenient (especially due to parking difficulties), they visited less often. This implies a **personal, rooted connection to a local place** that has changed over time due to both life stage and environmental factors.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""本南宁人"" (real/true Nanning native) — suggests rootedness, possibly generational or experiential.
  - ""小时候"" (as a child), ""长大"" (grew up), ""能选择的地方也多了"" (had more choices) — indicate a long-term personal history in the city.
  - ""朝阳"" — a specific local place, indicating familiarity and repeated use, suggesting a mental map of local significance.
  - ""后来...才去的少了"" — shows a shift in behavior over time, but still rooted in local experience.
  - ""停车难"" — while a functional livability issue, it is framed as a **reason for reduced attachment**, not as a standard for defining local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The phrase ""本南宁人"" sets the speaker’s identity as a genuine local, which is used to **lend authenticity to the shared experience** of growing up in Nanning.
  - The reference to growing up and changing habits emphasizes a **long-term personal connection** to the city and its spaces, supporting a **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** logic.
  - Mentioning Chaoyang as a common meeting place in childhood shows **mental mapping and emotional attachment**, suggesting **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  - The issue of parking is mentioned as a **practical reason for changing behavior**, but **not as a standard for defining local identity** — thus, **RL5 is not endorsed by the author** as part of the definition of “local”.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly identifies as a local** and **describes a shared local experience rooted in personal growth history**.
  - The author also **implies that Chaoyang holds symbolic meaning as a local gathering place**, indicating a conventional territorial identity.
  - The parking issue is not used to define local identity, so it is **not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author implicitly defines Chaoyang as a culturally significant and commonly accepted local space for social gatherings among locals.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author emphasizes their own growth history in Nanning and how it shapes their sense of local identity and behavior over time.

`RL1, RL6`"," The author is recalling the historical significance of the **Chaoyang area** in Nanning as a **central hub for business elites and capital figures**, implying that this area was once the **core of local economic and social activity**. This suggests that Chaoyang holds a kind of **symbolic, historical centrality** in defining what was considered the ""local"" or central part of Nanning.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **朝阳 (Chaoyang)** is positioned as the historical center — this hints at **territorial identity** and **mental mapping**.
  - **老万国酒楼 (Old Wanguo Restaurant)** is described as a meeting place for influential business figures — this suggests **depth of social roots** and **functional centrality**.
  - The phrase **“那时候南宁不大的”** (“At that time, Nanning wasn’t that big”) implies a **historical perception of spatial boundaries** and a sense of **local cohesion**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of Chaoyang as a central meeting point supports the idea that it was the **symbolic and functional core** of Nanning — this plays into how people mentally map and define **local identity**.
  - The use of terms like **“老万国酒楼”** and **“大老板谈生意”** implies that Chaoyang was not only geographically central but also **socially and economically significant**, reinforcing its status as a **local identity hub**.
  - The author's nostalgic tone and emphasis on this historical centrality suggest **implicit endorsement** of Chaoyang as a **symbolic heart** of local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **implicitly endorses** Chaoyang as the **historical and symbolic center** of Nanning — this aligns with **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  - The mention of **social and economic elites gathering in specific places** like the Old Wanguo Restaurant suggests an understanding of **local influence and rootedness** — this aligns with **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** is applicable because the author implicitly defines Chaoyang as the **historical and mental core** of Nanning, shaping a **symbolic territorial identity**.
  - **RL6** is applicable because the author links **business elites and their meeting places** to the **social and economic centrality** of the area, implying that such presence contributes to **local rootedness and status**.

The tone is nostalgic and humorous, and the speaker identifies themselves as originally from a rural part of Xixiangtang.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""我西乡塘农村的"" — indicates the speaker’s origin and upbringing environment.
  * ""小时候去朝阳广场我也怕"" — implies a contrast between the speaker’s rural upbringing and the urban environment.
  * ""有很多乞丐在那里然后会害怕"" — reflects a perception of urban space based on social and economic differences.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The speaker’s rural upbringing (RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History) is used to contrast with the urban experience of fear and discomfort.
  * The mention of ""朝阳广场"" and the presence of beggars reflects a perception of urban space, but it does **not** imply that the speaker uses this to define who is or is not a ""local."" It reflects a **personal emotional reaction** to a space, not a **criterion for defining local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**

不是，我也南宁人，但不是青秀区的，出来10年了那里的人装逼成这样了吗青秀区是什么了不起的地方吗？房价多少啊？,"RL1, RL6"," The author is expressing frustration and skepticism about the perceived pretentiousness or superiority complex of people from Qingxiu District in Nanning. They are questioning whether Qingxiu has become an overly self-important area, possibly due to rising property prices, and are indirectly challenging the idea that Qingxiu represents a higher-tier ""local"" identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “我也南宁人，但不是青秀区的” → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity), RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - “出来10年了” → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - “那里的人装逼成这样了吗” → RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - “青秀区是什么了不起的地方吗？” → RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)
  - “房价多少啊？” → RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism), RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author emphasizes their own status as a Nanning native but not from Qingxiu (RL1 and RL3), which serves to position themselves as a legitimate local while distancing from Qingxiu-specific identity.
  - The question about Qingxiu residents being “pretentious” implies a critique of how identity is being socially ranked or symbolized, possibly due to economic factors like property prices (RL6).
  - The sarcastic tone in questioning what makes Qingxiu “special” suggests the author does **not** accept Qingxiu as a naturally superior local identity, but acknowledges others might (RL1).
  - Mentioning property prices (房价多少啊) is not just about cost; it's linked to the perceived social hierarchy and identity symbolism, hence functions as RL6 and possibly RL5.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author does **not** endorse Qingxiu as a superior local identity, but they **do** recognize that others may use economic and territorial criteria to define local hierarchy.
  - The author implicitly acknowledges that economic status (RL6) and territorial perception (RL1) are being used by others to construct a sense of local superiority.
  - The author’s own identity as a Nanning native (but not Qingxiu) implies a broader, more inclusive sense of local identity (RL1 and RL3), contrasting with the perceived exclusivity of Qingxiu.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author is critical of how Qingxiu residents are perceived or perceive themselves as superior locals, possibly due to economic factors like property prices (RL6). They also challenge the notion that Qingxiu is a special or superior local area (RL1). While not explicitly endorsing these criteria, the author implies that these are the standards being used by others to define or elevate local identity.

The author identifies themselves as a “土生土长南宁人” (a person born and raised in Nanning), which serves to emphasize their local identity and possibly contrast it with both French colonial attitudes and the abstract notion of a “business district” that may not reflect real local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- “土生土长南宁人” (born and raised in Nanning) → clearly indicates a **personal rootedness in local birth and upbringing**.
- The contrast between French colonial attitudes and local identity may imply a **cultural and historical boundary**, but the author does not explicitly define local identity through administrative, cultural-linguistic, or social-rootedness criteria beyond their own upbringing.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The phrase “土生土长南宁人” functions as a **self-assertion of authentic local identity**, contrasting with the perceived foreign (French) gaze and the abstract, possibly artificial notion of a “business district” that may not reflect real localness.
- The author is not defining local identity through language, administrative boundaries, or economic status, but rather through **personal generational rootedness**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- Only **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** is clearly endorsed by the author as a basis for defining their own local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author uses the phrase “土生土长南宁人” to assert that being born and raised in Nanning is the standard or logic they personally use to define who is a “local person”. This aligns directly with RL3, which emphasizes individual growth history and generational rootedness.

本广西人现在是“地铁老人脸”。这都还没富起来呢，就开始拿起贵族姿态了我们偏远农村的广西人看来只能下广东或者出国了。不配奢望首府,"** `RL1, RL6`"," The author expresses frustration and irony toward certain local people (""地铁老人脸"") who, despite not being wealthy, already adopt an elitist attitude. The author contrasts this with rural Guangxi people who have to migrate to Guangdong or overseas, implying that they are excluded from the ""local"" elite identity in the provincial capital.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""地铁老人脸"" (subway-old-man-face): implies a stereotype of local people who look down on others, possibly linking to **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition)** or **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)**.
  - ""贵族姿态"" (noble/aristocratic posture): implies a sense of superiority based on status or position, pointing to **RL6**.
  - ""偏远农村的广西人"" (Guangxi people from remote rural areas): contrasted with the ""local elite"", possibly indicating a lack of local status due to geographic and social marginalization, linking to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** and **RL6**.
  - ""下广东或者出国"" (go to Guangdong or abroad): implies movement due to lack of local opportunity or status, possibly related to **RL6**.
  - ""不配奢望首府"" (not worthy of aspiring to the capital): implies a socially accepted boundary around who counts as a ""real"" or ""valued"" local in the capital, pointing to **RL1** and **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  - The phrase ""地铁老人脸"" and ""贵族姿态"" are used to mock a sense of local superiority that is not based on actual wealth or achievement. The author sees this as a symbolic status marker, not a legitimate one.
  - The contrast between rural Guangxi people and the local elite in the capital is central to the author's critique: the local elite use **social status, symbolic capital, and perhaps territorial identity** to exclude others.
  - The phrase ""不配奢望首府"" directly implies that there is a **socially conventional boundary** (RL1) and **status-based exclusion** (RL6) in defining who belongs in the capital as a ""real local"".

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** the criteria of ""贵族姿态"" or ""地铁老人脸"" as legitimate, but they **do acknowledge** these as criteria **used by others** to define local identity. However, since the author is **critiquing** rather than endorsing, these are **not annotated**.
  - The author **does endorse** the idea that rural Guangxi people are **excluded from local identity** in the capital, which implies a **socially conventional boundary** (RL1) and **status-based exclusion** (RL6) that the author critiques as real and operative.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author believes that there is a **socially conventional boundary** (RL1) in place that excludes rural people from being considered ""local"" in the capital.
  - The author also believes that **economic status and social roots** (RL6) are used to determine who counts as a ""real local"" or not, and rural Guangxi people are excluded from this category.

土著对老城区的执念是比较深的毕竟是从小到大生活学习的地方。虽然我五象这套房就在南宁大桥头，一过桥就可以回到青秀，但还是不习惯通勤习惯了5分钟就到，这里要提前20分钟起床，好难啊哈哈哈,"RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a sense of emotional attachment to their familiar, long-time residential area (青秀/Qingsiu), implying that this familiarity and lifelong connection make it their ""local"" area. They contrast this with a newer residential area (五象/Wuxiang), which, although geographically close, feels inconvenient and unfamiliar. The author uses their personal experience of convenience and habit to highlight a sense of local belonging tied to upbringing and daily routine.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""从小到大生活学习的地方"" → suggests lifelong residence and upbringing → **RL3**
  *   ""习惯了5分钟就到"" → implies habitual, embedded lifestyle → **RL3**
  *   ""不习惯通勤"" / ""要提前20分钟起床"" → contrast between embedded habits and new disruptions → **RL3**
  *   ""土著"" → self-identification as local → **RL3**, possibly **RL1**
  *   Implicit contrast between ""老城区"" (old city area) and ""五象"" (new district) → implies socially conventional distinction between ""core"" and ""non-core"" local areas → **RL1**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** Used to define who is ""local"" — the author implies that being a ""土著"" (native/local person) is tied to being raised in a place (""从小到大生活学习的地方"") and having embedded daily routines (""习惯了5分钟就到""). This forms the basis of their self-identification and emotional attachment to 青秀.
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The contrast between ""老城区"" (old city) and ""五象"" (new district) implies a socially accepted mental map where the ""old city"" is seen as the authentic or core local area. This supports the author's sense that the new area, despite being in the same city, is not fully ""local"" to them.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  Both **RL1** and **RL3** are clearly endorsed by the author as criteria for defining local identity:
  *   The author believes that being ""local"" is tied to **growing up in a place** and **being accustomed to its rhythms** (RL3).
  *   The author also implies that **certain areas (老城区) are more authentically local than others** (RL1), based on shared social perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs their local identity based on **personal rootedness in a place through lifelong growth and routine (RL3)** and **a conventional mental map that distinguishes between ""core"" and ""non-core"" local areas (RL1)**.

青秀区我有两套了，这边这套是我们的单位集资房，我们有股份，可以得分红，而且是按照职称高低才能买房子的大小，所以我爸说买咯。,** RL6," The author is describing their ownership of two properties in Qingxiu District, one of which is a **work-unit-funded housing** (单位集资房) in which they have **shares** and can **receive dividends**. The author also notes that **house size is allocated based on professional rank**, and their father supported the purchase because of this.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Ownership of **unit-funded housing** and **shares** in the property: possibly related to **RL6** (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism)
  - **Dividends** from property ownership: possibly related to **RL6**
  - **Allocation based on professional rank**: possibly related to **RL6**
  - Reference to **family decision** (我爸说买咯): possibly related to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **unit-funded housing**, **shares**, and **dividends** imply a **deep institutional and economic connection** to the local area, suggesting the author has **long-standing, rooted status** in the community — this supports the idea of a **genuine local identity** tied to **local economic structures**.
  - The **rank-based allocation** of housing size reflects **local social stratification mechanisms**, implying that the author belongs to a **privileged or recognized local group**.
  - The **family involvement** (father's decision) implies **intergenerational ties** to the local area, though it is not strong enough to be a central criterion for local identity in this case.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that their **economic stake** in the community (shares, dividends, housing based on rank) is a **legitimate basis for local identity**.
  - The **family decision-making** is present but not emphasized as a **core criterion** for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The **unit-funded housing**, **shares**, and **dividends** directly point to **RL6**, as they reflect **economic rootedness**, **community resource control**, and **status within the local system**.
  - While **RL3** (family rootedness) is mentioned, it is not the **main basis** the author uses to define their local identity.

住惯单位宿舍的不习惯住商业小区。每次想吃什么都要回老城区，特别是吃宵夜，动不动开车大半个小时，心鸭。这两天又把我崽拎回娘家蹭住，为了今晚能去琅东村觅食,"** RL1, RL3, RL4, RL5"," *   The author is expressing frustration and inconvenience related to no longer living in a work unit dormitory and having to travel long distances to access familiar food and lifestyle conveniences, particularly in the evening. The text implies a strong emotional and lifestyle attachment to the **old city area** and specifically **Langdong Village**, which is seen as a place offering familiar, desirable, and perhaps authentic local experiences.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""住惯单位宿舍的不习惯住商业小区"" → RL1 (habitual spatial identity), RL3 (lifestyle shaped by long-term residence)
  *   - ""每次想吃什么都要回老城区"" → RL1 (mental map of local core), RL5 (livability and accessibility)
  *   - ""吃宵夜"" → RL4 (food as cultural habit), RL1 (local night-life area)
  *   - ""开车大半个小时"" → RL1 (spatial boundary perception), RL5 (convenience as quality standard)
  *   - ""把我崽拎回娘家蹭住"" → RL3 (family rootedness), RL6 (social network support)
  *   - ""琅东村觅食"" → RL4 (food culture), RL1 (local identity of the place)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author is not just complaining about inconvenience — they are **constructing a sense of what constitutes a ""local"" lifestyle and where true local experiences exist**. The contrast between commercial housing and unit dormitories, the need to return to the old city for food, and the specific mention of Langdong Village all suggest a **preference for and identification with traditional or historically rooted local areas**.
  *   The author implicitly defines **""local"" as tied to long-term residence, habitual lifestyle patterns, cultural habits (especially food), and spatial familiarity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   - RL1: The author implicitly endorses the **old city and Langdong Village as the ""real"" local core**, based on habitual spatial identity and mental mapping.
  *   - RL4: The author implicitly endorses **food and cultural habits (especially local night food culture)** as a marker of local identity.
  *   - RL3: The author indirectly references **lifestyle continuity and family-based local rootedness** (bringing the child to the娘家 — maternal home — implies a return to familiar, rooted spaces).
  *   - RL5: The author evaluates **Langdong Village as a high-quality local space** due to its convenience and cultural richness, in contrast to the inconvenient commercial housing area.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author’s text implicitly constructs a definition of ""local"" that emphasizes **habitual spatial identity (RL1)** — the familiarity and comfort of the old city and Langdong Village as ""local"" spaces. This is reinforced by **cultural-linguistic recognition (RL4)**, particularly through food habits, which are strongly tied to a sense of belonging and localness. There is also a **lifestyle continuity and family-based rootedness (RL3)**, suggesting that true locals are those who maintain ties to these traditional spaces. Lastly, the author implicitly evaluates **Langdong Village as a high-quality local space (RL5)**, contrasting it with inconvenient commercial housing, reinforcing the idea that ""local"" is not just about where you live, but about **livability and cultural richness**.

我闺蜜前年搬去了五象，每次在五象湖地铁站出口下车出来就感觉瞬间从城市到了荒郊野岭要走一大段路才有点生活气息，给我住我真不习惯,"RL1, RL5"," The author is expressing a personal experience and opinion about the area around **Wuxiang Lake Metro Station**, indicating that upon exiting the station, they feel as though they've left the city and entered a remote, underdeveloped area. The author implies that this environment lacks the convenience and vibrancy associated with urban life and that they personally would not want to live there.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""从城市到了荒郊野岭"" (from the city to a remote wilderness) — suggests a **mental map** or **perceived urban boundary**, possibly RL1.
  - ""要走一大段路才有点生活气息"" (have to walk a long way before there’s any sign of daily life) — implies **functional livability**, such as accessibility to daily services and urban amenities, possibly RL5.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 element** (""从城市到了荒郊野岭"") plays a key role in constructing the author's perception of Wuxiang as **not truly urban**, and thus not aligned with their **mental map** of where ""real city life"" (and by implication, where ""real locals"" might live) is located.
  - The **RL5 element** (""要走一大段路才有点生活气息"") supports the author’s evaluation that the area lacks **urban convenience and livability**, which the author uses to justify their personal discomfort with living there. It reflects their **standards for what constitutes a livable or ""local"" urban environment**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both RL1 and RL5 are used by the author to **evaluate the area** and imply that it does not meet their standard of a ""local"" urban space. The author does not explicitly define who is a local person, but they **evaluate the area’s local-ness or urban-ness**, which is relevant to the broader question of **what areas are considered part of the ""local"" city**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author implicitly suggests that Wuxiang is **not part of the core urban mental map** and is instead perceived as peripheral or non-local in terms of identity and urban experience.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**: The author evaluates the area based on its **lack of urban amenities and convenience**, implying that such qualities are important in defining a **""good"" or ""real"" local urban area**.

南宁大桥头，那个位置好好，就是早晚高峰过桥很崩溃,N/A," *   The author is expressing a **positive evaluation of the location near Nanning Bridge (""那个位置好好"")**, while also acknowledging a **negative aspect — traffic congestion during peak hours (""早晚高峰过桥很崩溃"")**.
  *   However, the key point is that the author is **not making any assertions about who counts as a ""local person"" or what defines a ""local area"" in terms of identity**. They are expressing a **personal opinion about the livability or convenience of a specific location**, but **not tying that to criteria for defining local identity**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The text contains a **geographical reference (""南宁大桥头"")**, which might **initially suggest RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  *   The phrase **""那个位置好好""** indicates a **positive evaluation of the area**, possibly hinting at **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**.
  *   The phrase **""早晚高峰过桥很崩溃""** indicates a **negative functional aspect**, also related to **RL5**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The geographical reference (""南宁大桥头"") does not serve to define **who is local** or **what counts as a local area** — it's just a location marker.
  *   The evaluation of the area (good location but bad traffic) does **not serve to define local identity**, nor does it suggest any standard or logic used by the author to distinguish locals from non-locals.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   Although RL1 and RL5 are **mentioned or implied**, they are **not used by the author to define ""local identity"" or to evaluate the scope or quality of a ""local"" area in a way that defines who belongs or what counts as truly local**.
  *   The author is **not making a claim about local identity**, only about **personal experience or preference regarding a location's convenience**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   No RL category is clearly endorsed by the author as a **criterion for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating the scope or value of a ""local"" area**.
  *   The text is **not focused on identity boundaries**, but rather on **personal opinion about traffic and location**.

医科大自己在五象蟠龙这边都起有集资房，去要被服厂干嘛没听说过哦。当时说武鸣校区都附近准备起集资房，我老豆老母都冲咋咋报，结果木戳有地铁过去，不要了,"RL1, RL5"," The author is expressing skepticism about the logic of choosing to live in certain areas (such as a factory dormitory) when more suitable housing options (like集资房, self-funded housing) are available near the university campus or related institutions. The decision seems to be influenced by the **presence or absence of convenient infrastructure**, particularly **metro access**, which affects the desirability of a residential area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **""医科大自己在五象蟠龙这边都起有集资房""** – The university has built its own housing nearby.
  - **""不要了""**, **""结果木戳有地铁过去""** – The reason for rejecting the housing option is the **lack of metro access**.
  - **""武鸣校区""** – A specific campus location that implies a **geographical boundary** and potential **local identity** for university staff/family.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **availability of集资房** (self-funded housing) near the university implies a **functional residential preference** based on convenience and institutional affiliation.
  - The **lack of metro access** is used as a **key criterion for rejecting a housing option**, which reflects a **value judgment** on the **livability and desirability** of a location.
  - The **mention of武鸣校区** (Wuming Campus) implies a **territorial understanding** of where ""local"" housing for university staff should be, and where infrastructure should be concentrated.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly **uses the presence or absence of metro access as a standard** to judge whether a residential area is worth living in — this **links infrastructure to the quality of a local area**, fitting RL5.
  - The author also **implies that housing near the university (医科大) is more appropriate or expected**, which reflects a **socially conventional understanding of where staff should live**, fitting RL1.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is reflected in the assumption that university staff should live near the university or affiliated housing, and that doing otherwise is unusual or unnecessary.
  - **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)** is clearly endorsed through the rejection of housing due to the lack of metro access — a key infrastructure factor affecting livability and convenience.

They contrast this with the more congested and presumably busier Qingxiu District. While the tone is subjective and experiential, the author is **implying that Wuxiang has qualities that make it a desirable or even superior ""local"" living space**, especially compared to other parts of the city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   - ""喜欢清静"" (prefer quietness) — **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition)**
  *   - ""马路很宽不会堵车"" (wide roads, no traffic jams) — **RL5**
  *   - ""空气也很好傍晚饭后可以在江边散步"" (good air quality, can walk by the river after dinner) — **RL5**
  *   - ""宜家，万象汇，总部基地那块吃的，购物也很方便"" (Ikea, MixC, headquarters base — convenient for dining and shopping) — **RL5**

  *   - ""回市区感觉哪哪都堵"" (back to the city center, everywhere is congested) — **RL5**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   All the RL5 elements listed above are used to **support the author's evaluation of Wuxiang as a high-quality local living area**. The author is not merely describing Wuxiang’s features; they are **contrasting it with the city center** and **implying that Wuxiang is a better-defined ""local"" area** in terms of livability and lifestyle. This evaluative stance suggests that the author **uses RL5 criteria as a standard for judging the ""local"" quality of an area**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   All the RL5 criteria are **clearly endorsed by the author** and used to **evaluate and define the ""local"" quality of Wuxiang** — not just as personal preferences, but as **standards for what makes a place a good or desirable ""local"" area**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is **constructing a definition of ""local"" based on functional livability and environmental quality** — using wide roads, clean air, green space, and convenient facilities as **positive indicators** of a good local area.

大院长大，搬出大院，买到新的房，许多南宁人的轨迹也差不多是这样，再回到大院住也没曾经的的感觉，不符合现在的邻里关系了。老城区固然好，过去的终将也是过去了,"** RL1, RL3"," The author reflects on the changing nature of residential life and identity in南宁 (Nanning), particularly focusing on how moving out of traditional ""big courtyards"" (大院) and into new housing has become a common life trajectory. There is a sense of nostalgia for the past, but also a recognition that returning to old living arrangements no longer fits modern social dynamics or identity experiences. The author implies that the sense of ""local"" tied to these old neighborhoods has diminished over time.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""大院长大"" (grew up in the big courtyard): hints at **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**.
  - ""过去的终将也是过去了"" (the past is ultimately in the past): implies a shift in the perception of what constitutes a meaningful local identity, possibly pointing to **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.
  - ""不符合现在的邻里关系了"" (no longer fits the current neighborhood relations): suggests that traditional forms of social integration (which might be tied to place identity) are no longer valid, again pointing to **RL1** and **RL3**.
  - No explicit mention of administrative identity (RL2), cultural-linguistic markers (RL4), functional livability (RL5), economic or social rootedness (RL6), or occupational symbolism (RL7).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: The author acknowledges that many people grew up in these courtyards and moved out, suggesting that personal history in a place was once a strong marker of local identity. However, the author also implies that this historical rootedness is no longer sufficient to define or sustain a sense of ""local"" in the present.
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author reflects on how the emotional and social meaning of these traditional neighborhoods has changed over time, indicating that the conventional territorial identity tied to these areas has weakened.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL1** and **RL3** are clearly referenced and used by the author to reflect on how the concept of ""local"" has evolved. The author does not reject these criteria outright but rather laments their transformation, indicating that they were once central to defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's reflection centers on the emotional and experiential changes in local identity. Growing up in a big courtyard (RL3) used to be a core part of being a local, but that experience no longer carries the same weight. Similarly, the author acknowledges a shift in how these traditional areas are perceived (RL1), implying that the social and emotional boundaries of ""local"" have changed.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
因为渝中的拆迁户基本上都在李家沱,"** RL1, RL3"," *   The author is making a statement about the relocation patterns of people displaced by demolition in Yuzhong, suggesting that most of them have moved to Lijiahuo. This implies a change in the demographic composition of both areas — Yuzhong losing long-standing residents and Lijiahuo gaining them. The core expressive intent is to suggest that this migration has caused a shift in the perception or definition of local identity between these two areas.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase ""demolition households"" implies a migration or resettlement event, which may affect local identity.
  *   The phrase ""basically all in Lijiahuo"" implies a concentration of a certain group in a new area, possibly altering its local character or identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of demolition households relocating to Lijiahuo serves to argue that Lijiahuo is no longer just a traditional residential area but has become a new center for displaced locals from Yuzhong.
  *   This relocation is being used to redefine or reframe the local identity of Lijiahuo — it is no longer just a place with its own original local identity but has absorbed a significant portion of Yuzhong’s former residents, thereby changing its local character.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author implies that the **relocation of demolition households** has transformed Lijiahuo into a de facto extension or continuation of Yuzhong’s local identity.
  *   This implies a **change in the symbolic boundary** of where “local Yuzhong people” are now located, and possibly a **redefinition of local identity based on migration history and resettlement**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The author implies that the demolition households, although relocated, carry with them a historical rootedness in Yuzhong. Their movement to Lijiahuo means that Lijiahuo now contains people who were once deeply connected to Yuzhong, thus changing its local identity.
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author is redefining the mental map or perception of local identity — suggesting that Lijiahuo is now part of the extended local territory of Yuzhong due to this demographic shift.

**Output:** RL1, RL3"
不会吧渝中区的拆迁户跑李家沱去干撒子，,RL1**," The author is expressing surprise or disbelief that demolition-affected residents from Yuzhong District would go to Lijiapo (李家沱) to do something (干撒子 is colloquial for “what are they doing there?”). This implies a **sense of mismatch or inappropriateness** in the author's mind — that people from a core urban, presumably more prestigious area (Yuzhong) are going to a peripheral or less central area (Lijiapo), which may be perceived as socially or spatially incongruent.

This suggests that the author holds certain **implicit criteria for spatial identity** — that people from a certain area (Yuzhong) should remain in or be associated with spaces that match their perceived status or identity, and going to a different area may violate that expectation.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “渝中区” (Yuzhong District): A specific administrative and symbolic core area of Chongqing.
  - “李家沱” (Lijiapo): A different district, likely perceived as peripheral or less central.
  - Implicit assumption that there is a **spatial mismatch** between where someone is from and where they end up.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of Yuzhong and Lijiapo is not just geographical; it serves to highlight a **spatial and identity dissonance**. The author is not surprised at the act of relocation per se, but at the **direction of movement** — from a “core” to a “periphery” — which challenges their expectation of how “local” people should move or belong.
  - This implies a **socially conventional mental map** of where people belong and where they don’t, based on their original territorial identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses a **territorial identity logic** that associates people from Yuzhong with a higher status or centrality, and Lijiapo with a lower or marginal status.
  - This supports the idea that the author uses **socially conventional spatial cognition** to judge or question the legitimacy of someone’s movement or presence in a certain area — a key function of **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s surprise is rooted in a **socially conventional mental map** that defines where people “should” be based on their origin — a symbolic boundary between core and peripheral areas.
  - This aligns with **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**, as it reflects a **symbolic understanding of space and belonging** that is widely shared or assumed.

爸爸是510203我是500104 土生土长ddk,"RL2, RL3, RL4"," *   The author is asserting their local identity by referencing their household registration (hukou) number and that of their father, emphasizing that they are ""土生土长"" (native/local from birth). The abbreviation ""ddk"" is likely a local dialect or cultural reference understood within a specific regional context, further reinforcing their local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""爸爸是510203 我是500104"" — This refers to hukou (household registration) codes, which are used to determine administrative affiliation and are often linked to local identity in Chinese cities.
  *   ""土生土长"" — This phrase implies being born and raised in the area, suggesting a deep-rooted family history and local identity.
  *   ""ddk"" — Though not explicitly explained, it may represent a local linguistic or cultural marker, possibly indicating a dialect or local expression.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The hukou numbers serve to **objectively demonstrate** the author's and their father's administrative identity and regional affiliation, which the author implicitly uses as a **legitimacy standard** for being considered ""local.""
  *   ""土生土长"" functions as a **personal identity marker**, emphasizing **long-term rootedness** and **generational continuity** in the local area.
  *   ""ddk"" functions as a **cultural-linguistic marker**, possibly indicating that the author is **recognized as local** through shared language or cultural expressions.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The hukou numbers are used by the author to **define local identity**, aligning with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
  *   ""土生土长"" is used to **assert deep-rootedness and generational connection**, aligning with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.
  *   ""ddk"" implies **linguistic or cultural recognition**, aligning with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author defines their local identity through **administrative legitimacy** (RL2) via hukou, **family rootedness** (RL3) through being ""土生土长"", and **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) through the use of ""ddk"".

小时候在南坪，现在在坡区，而且我爸妈又在考虑搬回南坪,RL3," The author is sharing a personal narrative of residential mobility — having grown up in Naping (南坪), currently living in Po District (坡区), and with their parents considering moving back to Naping. This implies a personal connection and emotional attachment to Naping as a place of origin or identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “小时候在南坪” (Grew up in Naping) → RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)
  - “现在在坡区” (Now in Po District) → Not sufficient to define local identity; just a current location
  - “爸妈又在考虑搬回南坪” (Parents are considering moving back to Naping) → RL3 again, suggesting a family-level rootedness and continuity

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - RL3 plays a central role: The author's mention of growing up in Naping and their parents’ potential return indicates that **personal and family history in a place** is meaningful in how they perceive their own local identity. There is an implied emotional and possibly identity-based pull back to the original place of upbringing.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only RL3 is clearly endorsed and functionally used to convey a sense of rootedness and identity tied to Naping, despite current residence elsewhere.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implicitly defines “local” not by current residence, but by **early life experience and family continuity** in Naping. This aligns with RL3, which emphasizes birth, upbringing, and multi-generational presence as the basis for local identity.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL3"

RL1, RL3"," The author is sharing a personal narrative about how their family—particularly the older generations—holds a specific and traditional understanding of what areas in Chongqing ""count"" as the city or urban core (e.g., places like **Jiefangbei**, and to a lesser extent **Daping**), and how their own experience and current residence in **Zhaomu Mountain** (which was once seen as remote) challenges that view. The author also mentions their **family roots in traditional urban neighborhoods** (较场口, 摊子口) and how that shaped their family’s perception of urban identity.

There is a strong **implicit endorsement** of both **historical-cultural rootedness** and **changing perceptions of what constitutes the urban ""local"" area**, with a contrast between older and newer parts of the city.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Family rootedness in traditional urban areas: **RL3**
  - Mention of specific traditional urban neighborhoods (较场口, 摊子口, 解放碑): **RL1**
  - Perception that certain areas (e.g., 大坪) are ""urban"" and others (照母山) are ""remote"" but now reversed: **RL1**
  - The author's current residence and work location in 照母山, now seen as the ""cosmic center"": **RL1**
  - Implicit contrast in what counts as ""urban"" over time: **RL1**
  - No mention of language, administrative boundaries, economic assets, or occupational identity.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness):** Used to establish the **family's historical connection to the city**, which informs their (and the older generation’s) perception of what counts as the ""real city"".
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author contrasts **traditional urban areas** (e.g., Jiefangbei) with newer ones (Zhaomu Mountain), showing how **local identity is tied to mental maps and conventional understandings of urban space**, which evolve over time. The author **implicitly accepts** this framework, even as they challenge it through their own experience.

---

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not resist** RL1 or RL3; instead, they **reflect on and partially endorse** both.
  - The author **does not use** RL2, RL4, RL5, or RL7 in defining ""local"".

---

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL3** is present because the author emphasizes **family history and generational rootedness** in traditional urban neighborhoods as part of their identity.
  - **RL1** is present because the author discusses **changing perceptions of urban boundaries**, **mental maps**, and what areas are considered part of the ""city"" or ""local"" space.

500107，土生土长破区，现居两江新区。,"RL1, RL3, RL5"," *   The author is making a personal statement about their identity and current residence. They are asserting their origin (""土生土长"", meaning ""born and raised here"") and specifying the area they come from (""破区"", a derogatory term for a rundown or less desirable district). They also mention their current residence (""两江新区"", a newer, more developed area in Chongqing).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""土生土长"" — suggests a long-term, rooted presence in a place, potentially pointing to **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  *   ""破区"" — implies a specific area with a negative social label, suggesting a **socially conventional perception of the area's status**, potentially pointing to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  *   ""两江新区"" — indicates a shift from a traditional or old area to a newer, more developed one, which might imply a contrast in **functional livability or environmental quality**, potentially pointing to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""土生土长"" serves to **establish the author's deep-rooted connection to their origin**, supporting a claim of authentic local identity. This shows endorsement of **RL3** as a valid criterion for local identity.
  *   ""破区"" implies a **socially conventional perception of inferiority** or marginalization, and the author's use of it to describe their origin may suggest a **self-awareness of the area's symbolic status**, aligning with **RL1**.
  *   ""两江新区"" is a newer, more developed district, and the author’s current residence there may imply a **value judgment about livability and status**, suggesting that they have moved to a ""better"" area, which supports **RL5**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **not resisting** any of these criteria; rather, they are **using them to construct a narrative of origin and relocation**, which implies that they **implicitly endorse** these criteria as relevant to local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL3** is clearly present through the phrase “土生土长”, which directly refers to being born and raised in a place — a common way to establish deep local roots.
  *   **RL1** is present in the use of “破区”, which reflects a **socially conventional, even stigmatized, understanding of a place’s identity**, used by the author to label their origin.
  *   **RL5** is implied through the contrast between “破区” and “两江新区”, where the latter is understood to be a **more desirable, modern, and livable area**, suggesting the author associates quality of life with local identity.

107，小时候住两路口，八岁搬回坡区，就一直在杨家坪前后打转转了。,RL3," The author is sharing their personal residential history, describing movement from one part of the city (两路口) to another (坡区), and then staying in the 杨家坪 area for a long time. This suggests a **narrative of rootedness and familiarity with specific urban areas**, implying a connection to these places as part of their personal identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""小时候住两路口"" (lived in 两路口 as a child)
  - ""八岁搬回坡区"" (moved back to 坡区 at age 8)
  - ""一直在杨家坪前后打转转了"" (kept moving around the 杨家坪 area ever since)

These phrases suggest **long-term residence and personal growth history** in specific districts of Chongqing.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author uses their **residential trajectory** as a way to situate their own identity within the city. While not explicitly defining ""local identity"" for others, the text implies that **growing up and staying in certain areas contributes to a sense of belonging or localness**. The tone is **neutral to slightly nostalgic**, showing that these areas are part of the speaker’s personal history and likely form the basis of their local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The speaker **does not oppose** or question the relevance of **growing up and living in specific areas** as a basis for local identity. Instead, the narrative **implicitly accepts** this as a **natural way to define one’s local affiliation**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the speaker defines their own local identity through **where they grew up and have lived for a long time**.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL3"
是不是开始有成都口音了,** RL4," The text is a question asking, ""Are you starting to have a Chengdu accent?"" This implies the author is observing or questioning whether someone is beginning to adopt a local linguistic characteristic — specifically, the Chengdu dialect or accent.

This question subtly suggests that **acquiring a local accent** is seen as an indicator or **marker of local identity**, or at least a noticeable shift towards assimilation into the local culture. The speaker is likely surprised or curious about a perceived change in the other person's speech, which they associate with being more ""local.""

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “成都口音” (Chengdu accent), which directly relates to **language and accent**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The question implies that **speaking with a local accent is a meaningful signal** — possibly of integration, adaptation, or identification with local culture. The speaker is **positively acknowledging or noting** this change, rather than resisting it. Thus, the **use of a local accent is treated as a criterion for evaluating local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **not resisting** or criticizing the idea that having a Chengdu accent is linked to local identity. Instead, they are **implicitly endorsing** it as a noticeable or significant trait — hence, it functions as a **criterion for identifying local identity**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which involves using **language, accent, or local cultural habits** as a basis for determining whether someone is perceived as ""local"" or has adopted local characteristics.

**Output:** RL4"
整个重庆主城区都主要是本地人，重庆不像那些真一线城市那么多移民，最近几年才开始多起来外地口音移居过来的。,** RL4," The author's core intent is to express that the main urban area of Chongqing is predominantly inhabited by ""local people,"" and that this was especially the case before recent years. They contrast Chongqing with ""true first-tier cities"" that have historically had more migrants, implying that the presence of migrants and the emergence of foreign accents are relatively new phenomena in Chongqing. The author implicitly defines ""local people"" through contrast with ""外地口音"" (non-local accents), suggesting that linguistic identity is a marker of localness.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""整个重庆主城区都主要是本地人"" — Suggests a general identification of the main urban area with local people.
  - ""不像那些真一线城市那么多移民"" — Implies that high levels of immigration are associated with ""true first-tier cities,"" by contrast positioning Chongqing as less immigrant-heavy.
  - ""最近几年才开始多起来外地口音移居过来的"" — Indicates that non-local accents are a recent phenomenon, implying that accent and speech patterns are key markers of local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author constructs a contrast between Chongqing and ""true first-tier cities"" in terms of immigration and cultural homogeneity. The emergence of ""外地口音"" (non-local accents) is framed as a recent development, suggesting that historically, Chongqing lacked such linguistic diversity. This implies that **linguistic-cultural identity** (specifically accent) is a key criterion the author uses to define ""local people.""

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author implicitly endorses **linguistic-cultural recognition** (specifically, local accent) as a marker of local identity. They do not explicitly define localness through administrative boundaries, family rootedness, or other RL types. Instead, they rely on linguistic markers to distinguish between local and non-local.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The key RL category is **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, as the author uses accent and linguistic change over time as a proxy for shifts in local identity and population composition.

**Output:** RL4"
那挨得近~都是土生土长的~,** RL3," *   The author is expressing that people who live close by are all ""土生土长的"" — literally meaning ""born and raised here"", implying a shared local identity rooted in having grown up in the area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is “土生土长的”, which directly implies a personal or family history of being born and raised in the local area.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   This phrase is used to emphasize a sense of shared local identity among nearby residents. It is not just a descriptive statement but functions to distinguish locals from non-locals based on being born and raised in the area.
  *   The author implicitly endorses this as a criterion for defining who counts as a local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The criterion of being born and raised locally is clearly endorsed and used to define ""local people"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This matches **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, which focuses on identity based on being born and raised in the area, or having family roots there.
  *   The author is suggesting that proximity of residence correlates with being ""local"", and the justification is rooted in personal or family growth history.

They reject outdated or less authentic claims to local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""老辈子的"" (old generation's) — possibly RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness)
  - ""直辖前更新的那批"" (those updated before the municipality status) — possibly RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)
  - ""解放碑五一路土生土长"" (born and raised in Jiefangbei Wuyi Road) — clearly RL3
  - ""500103"" (household registration number) — clearly RL2

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author is constructing a clear boundary of who counts as a ""local"" by emphasizing **birth and upbringing in a specific local area** (RL3) and **household registration** (RL2). These elements are used to **assert their own superior claim to local identity** and to **reject others' claims** as outdated or less authentic.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **explicitly endorses**:
    - Being ""born and raised"" in a specific local area (RL3)
    - Having a specific household registration number (RL2)

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author's argument is built on two RL categories:
    - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: Used to assert a deep, personal connection to the area through birth and upbringing.
    - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: Used to anchor this identity in official documentation (household registration number), reinforcing the legitimacy of their claim.

The core expressive intent is to **establish their local identity rooted in a specific geographic area of Chongqing**, with an emphasis on birth and upbringing in a particular location, even though they currently reside elsewhere.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""渝中区土著"" — suggests rootedness and origin in a specific area.
  *   ""大坪土生土长"" — clearly indicates birth and upbringing in a specific place.
  *   ""现在住渝北"" — current residence, but not framed as the basis for local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""渝中区土著"" and ""大坪土生土长"" function to **establish the author’s authentic local identity** based on deep-rooted generational or personal history in a particular area.
  *   The current residence in Yubei is mentioned but not used to define the author’s sense of local identity — it serves more as a contrast or update on current living conditions, not as a basis for local belonging.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly emphasizes **birth and upbringing in a specific place (Daping, Yuzhong District)** as the foundation of their local identity.
  *   There is **no indication** that administrative boundaries, cultural habits, economic status, or other criteria are being used to define their sense of being ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   This aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**, as the author defines their local identity through being ""土生土长"" (born and raised) in a particular area.

They seem to be seeking recognition of their **authentic local identity**, despite the administrative reclassification of their birthplace from九龙坡 (Jiulongpo) to大渡口 (Dadukou). The rhetorical question ""就没有大渡口的土著吗？"" implies a desire to find others with similar rootedness in the area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **Family historical rootedness**: ""我妈小时候是城头的，大溪沟，枣子岚垭，我爸是和平路的""
  - **Birthplace and personal history**: ""我出生的时候还属于九龙坡""
  - **Administrative boundary change**: ""后来就变成了大渡口""
  - **Hukou or ID number reference**: ""我是510203"" (implied to be a former ID prefix for Jiulongpo)

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **family history** and **birthplace** are used to assert a **deep-rooted connection to the local area**, which the author sees as key to being a ""true local"" or ""土著"".
  - The **administrative boundary change** is **not accepted as a negation** of this local identity — the author **resists the idea** that being reclassified under Dadukou changes their ""local"" status.
  - The **ID number (510203)** is used to **support the claim of original local status**, indicating a **hukou-based identification** with Jiulongpo before it was reclassified.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: Strongly endorsed — the author emphasizes both parental origins and their own birthplace as the basis for claiming to be a local.
  - **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**: Partially endorsed — the author **rejects the new administrative boundary** as negating their local identity and **clings to the original administrative hukou** as more legitimate.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author constructs their claim to being a ""local"" based on **family history and birthplace (RL3)**, and **implicitly resists the new administrative boundary (RL2)**, instead **affirming the older administrative identity as more authentic**.

The implied viewpoint is that **these functional livability factors contribute to the district's status or value as a ""local"" area**, even if it is old.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""配套齐全 医疗 教育 交通"" (well-equipped with medical care, education, and transportation) — relates to **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The mention of ""配套齐全"" (well-equipped) serves to **justify the value or quality of the local area**, countering the potential negative perception of it being ""old"". The author is **positively evaluating the area** based on its functional livability, implying that such features are important in defining a high-quality or acceptable ""local"" residential area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **clearly endorses** the idea that functional infrastructure (medical, education, transportation) contributes to the **evaluation of the area's local value or quality**, thus fitting the RL5 category.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author uses **RL5** logic: despite the district being old, it is still considered valuable or acceptable as a ""local"" area due to its strong functional livability characteristics.

RL3"," *   The author is expressing a sense of **personal history and emotional attachment** to the area of **Hualongqiao (化龙桥)**, where they spent their **childhood and student years**, despite having moved away 20 years ago due to demolition. They seem to be emphasizing that their **identity as a ""local""** (presumably of Chongqing or a specific urban area) is rooted in their **early life experiences and family history in Hualongqiao**, rather than their current place of residence (Shapingba).

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""化龙桥曾经贫困一条街"" – Mentions a specific area and its former socio-economic status, but not used to define local identity.
  *   ""拆迁户搬到沙坪坝了"" – Mentions relocation, but not used to deny local identity.
  *   ""都搬了20年了"" – Indicates time passed since moving, but not directly about local identity.
  *   ""我的童年和学生时代都在化龙桥呀"" – Strongly implies that **growing up in a place (childhood and formative years)** is a key basis for identifying as local.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The phrase **""我的童年和学生时代都在化龙桥呀""** functions as the **core justification** for the author's claim to being a local of that area. Despite having moved away for two decades, the author is asserting that their **early life and upbringing in Hualongqiao** still qualify them as a ""local"" of that place.
  *   The author implicitly resists the idea that **current residence or administrative changes** determine local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author **explicitly endorses** the idea that **growing up in a place (childhood and student years)** is a valid and meaningful basis for claiming local identity.
  *   There is **no endorsement** of administrative boundaries, current residence, or economic status as criteria for local identity.
  *   There is **no mention** of language, culture, or social networks.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The relevant RL category is:
      *   **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History** – The author is asserting that their **childhood and formative years in Hualongqiao** are the foundation of their local identity, despite having moved away 20 years ago. This aligns with the RL3 logic that **growing up in a place** (not necessarily current residence) is a basis for claiming local identity.

They conclude by expressing a personal preference for **Liangan New District (两江新区)** as the most suitable place to live, citing the abundance of parks.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **birthplace (渝中)** and early life (幼儿园小学住渝中): Possible RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - Educational trajectory across multiple districts:渝中→南岸→沙区→江北→两江新区: May relate to RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) if implying identity or familiarity with these areas.
  - Preference for **两江新区** due to **公园多 (many parks)**: Directly relates to RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The life trajectory across districts is **not used to define local identity**, but rather to illustrate their personal experience and justify their current preference.
  - The mention of **park density** in 两江新区 is directly used to evaluate it as a **""good local residential area""**, linking environmental quality to livability standards — this plays a **central role** in the author’s evaluative claim.
  - The author does **not use birthplace or growth history** to assert local identity or superiority of渝中 or any other district.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL5** is used to evaluate the quality of a ""local"" area (两江新区) and is directly tied to the author’s core assertion that it is the most suitable for living.
  - Other elements (birthplace, educational districts) are background information and not criteria for defining or evaluating ""local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author’s core evaluative statement — that 两江新区 is most suitable for living due to its many parks — fits the RL5 category, which involves evaluating areas based on environmental quality and functional livability.
  - There is **no endorsement of criteria** related to territorial identity, family rootedness, cultural-linguistic markers, administrative boundaries, social roots, or occupational symbolism.

出生在大坪医院 然后一直住谢家湾这边 我妈想卖房子搬家 我不愿意离开,** RL3," The author is expressing emotional resistance to leaving the area where they were born and raised — specifically, the DaPing Hospital and Xiejiawan areas. The key sentiment is a strong attachment to the place due to **personal birth and growth history**, indicating that this history plays a role in their sense of local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""出生在大坪医院"" (born at DaPing Hospital) — suggests a strong local birth connection.
  - ""一直住谢家湾这边"" (always lived in the Xiejiawan area) — indicates long-term residence and growth in a specific local area.
  - ""不愿意离开"" (not willing to leave) — reflects emotional or identity-based attachment rooted in personal history.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The birthplace and long-term residence are not just incidental facts — they are central to the author’s emotional resistance to relocation. The author implicitly defines their local identity based on **where they were born and raised**, and this becomes a **criterion for defining their sense of belonging and what counts as 'local'** to them.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The text clearly links **birthplace and long-term residence** to a strong sense of local identity and unwillingness to move. These are criteria **endorsed by the author** to define their local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The author defines their local identity based on **birth and upbringing in a specific area**, which aligns with **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.

  *   ""两江三岸"" — This is a **geographical and symbolic territorial marker** in Chongqing, often used to denote the traditional urban core.
  *   The implication is that **residency in this area during a specific historical period** confers authentic local status.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The author uses the **historical centrality of Jiefangbei** and the **symbolic importance of the two rivers and three banks** to define a **core local identity**. This is not about legal residence, language, or economic status, but about **being present in the symbolic heart of the city during its formative era**.
  *   The author **endorses** this as the **authentic standard** for being a ""local"" and implicitly **excludes others** who moved in later or live in peripheral areas.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly **uses historical and symbolic territorial identity** to define who counts as a ""local"".
  *   The author also **implies a generational or historical rootedness**, though not explicitly in terms of family lineage or birthplace.
  *   There is **no mention of administrative status, language, or economic indicators**, so those are **not relevant**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The author defines ""local"" based on being in a **symbolically significant area (两江三岸)** during a **historically recognized era (when Jiefangbei was the sole commercial center)**. This reflects a **socially conventional, emotionally and historically rooted sense of local identity**.
  *   **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** While not explicitly mentioning family history or being born there, the **implicit logic is that only those who were there during the formative era of the city’s identity** qualify as true locals. This implies a **historical rootedness**, though not necessarily multi-generational.

**Step 6: Output Result**
  
**Output:** RL1, RL3"
口音是重庆城头口音，不能有区县口音,** RL4," The author is clearly emphasizing a distinction between types of accents, asserting that a ""true local"" should speak with the accent of the urban core of Chongqing (""重庆城头口音"") and not have a county-level or suburban accent (""区县口音""). This is not a neutral observation but a prescriptive or evaluative stance on what constitutes authentic local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is ""口音是重庆城头口音，不能有区县口音"" (must have the accent of central Chongqing, cannot have a county accent), which directly relates to **linguistic identity** and how it defines who is considered a ""local.""

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The linguistic distinction (urban vs. county accent) functions as a **criterion for social differentiation**—it is used to **include or exclude** individuals from the category of ""local people."" The author implicitly values the urban accent as the authentic standard and rejects the county accent as non-local or less local.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author clearly endorses **accent** as a defining feature of local identity, and specifically distinguishes between urban and county-level accents in determining who counts as ""local."" This is not a description of others' behavior or a neutral observation—it's a value judgment the author holds.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  This aligns with **RL4: Cultural-Linguistic Recognition**, which involves identifying whether someone belongs to the ""local people"" group based on language, accent, or local cultural habits. The author is using accent as a gatekeeping mechanism for local identity.

**Output:** RL4"
现在从下半城搬到了“镇头”（龙溪镇），但是十八梯的老房子我老汉还在那里住。他们土生土长在那里住惯了。,RL3**," The author is describing a family relocation from one area (""下半城"") to another (""镇头"" or Longxi Town), while emphasizing that their father still lives in the old house on ""十八梯"", a historically rooted local area. The core expressive intent is to convey a sense of **familial and generational rootedness** in a specific place — ""十八梯"" — which is implied to be the ""true"" or more authentic local space due to long-standing residence and family continuity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- ""从...搬到了..."" — indicates movement between areas, suggesting a contrast in spatial identity.
- ""十八梯的老房子我老汉还在那里住"" — emphasizes continued family residence in a specific place.
- ""他们土生土长在那里住惯了"" — explicitly mentions being ""native"" (土生土长) and accustomed to the place, indicating a strong sense of rootedness and generational continuity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The relocation narrative sets up a contrast between a new place and an old, rooted one.
- The continued residence in ""十八梯"" and the phrase ""土生土长"" function to **highlight a deeper, inherited connection** to a specific local area, which the author implicitly regards as the **true marker of local identity**.
- The author's tone implies respect and recognition of this rootedness as a **legitimate or meaningful basis for defining who is ""local""**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author clearly endorses **long-term, generational residence in a specific place** as a **core marker of local identity**, as seen in the case of the father and the phrase ""土生土长"" (native-born and raised).
- This supports the RL3 category: **Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- The author implicitly defines ""local people"" through **generational rootedness and family continuity in a specific place**, even though the speaker themselves have moved. The phrase ""土生土长在那里住惯了"" directly supports RL3, which emphasizes **birth, upbringing, and intergenerational settlement** as the basis for local identity.

**Output: RL3**"
我爸因为50年前因为工作原因从渝中区换到九龙坡区 因为有套房所以户口也就转到在九龙坡了 ，那时候没得房价更值钱的概念 上班要坐绿皮火车太折腾了…… 早知道就死守渝中区哟,RL1," The author expresses a sense of regret over their father's decision to move from **Yuzhong District** to **Jiulongpo District** 50 years ago. The decision was based on job-related convenience and housing at the time, but the author now reflects that, with the benefit of hindsight and current real estate value awareness, staying in Yuzhong District would have been more advantageous.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - Mention of **""work reason""** and **""house""** leading to relocation and **hukou transfer** — potentially related to **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** and **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**.
  - The author's emphasis on **""死守渝中区"" (stick to Yuzhong District)** and the implication that this would have been better — possibly indicating a belief in the **symbolic or administrative value** of being in a specific district.
  - The mention of **""早知道就死守渝中区哟"" (Wish we had stayed in Yuzhong District)** implies a belief that **district identity (Yuzhong)** carries long-term value, possibly social or symbolic, suggesting **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **hukou transfer** is not framed as a current identity marker but rather as a historical decision made for practical reasons, not as a current endorsement of administrative identity. So **RL2 is not strongly endorsed**.
  - The **family's relocation** and the father's decision are described as past actions, not as a current basis for defining local identity. So **RL3 is not strongly endorsed**.
  - The **regret and emphasis on ""sticking to Yuzhong District""** indicate that the author believes **Yuzhong has a symbolic or superior status** in terms of being a ""true"" or ""better"" local area, suggesting a **territorial identity logic** that aligns with **RL1**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is clearly **endorsed or implicitly assumed** by the author as a **criterion for evaluating or defining ""local"" areas**.
  - Other RL types are either **not endorsed**, **not used to define local identity**, or **not central to the author’s argument**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author implies that **Yuzhong District has a special symbolic status**, and that moving away from it was a mistake — this reflects a **socially conventional belief in the superior local status of certain areas**, aligning with **RL1**.
  - There is **no endorsement** of administrative identity, cultural identity, or rootedness as the basis for defining ""local"" in this text.

**Step 6: Output Result**

Output: RL1"
市中心土生土长的很少 因为以前就没多少人 看以前的老照片就知道 又没高楼 外来的比较多,RL3," The author is expressing the idea that few people are truly ""local"" in the city center because historically the population was sparse and the area was underdeveloped. The author implies that most current residents are not rooted in the area historically and are instead newcomers (""外来的"").

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - “市中心土生土长的很少” — suggests **RL3** (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as it refers to people born and raised locally.
  - “因为以前就没多少人” — implies a **historical context** of population sparsity, indirectly supporting the idea that few have deep historical roots.
  - “看以前的老照片就知道 又没高楼” — refers to historical development and physical transformation, which may support **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity) or **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition), but only if used to define local identity or evaluate the area.
  - “外来的比较多” — reinforces the contrast between native-born and newcomers, again pointing to **RL3**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The author uses the idea of being “born and raised in the city center” to define what it means to be “truly local” — this is a **core evaluative standard** for local identity.
  - The historical underdevelopment of the area is used to **explain** the lack of local rootedness, but not as a **criterion** for defining localness itself. Therefore, it supports the argument but is not itself an RL criterion.
  - The mention of “外来” (newcomers) is used to contrast with the few “native” locals, reinforcing the importance of **RL3**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Only **RL3** is explicitly used by the author as a **criterion** to define who is “local” — specifically, being “born and raised” in the city center.
  - Other elements (historical development, physical environment) are **background explanations**, not criteria used by the author to define local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author clearly implies that to be considered a “local” in the city center, one should have deep **historical and generational ties** to the area — specifically, being born and raised there.
  - This aligns with the **RL3** category: “Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History”.

**Step 6: Output Result**
Output: RL3"
同意！下楼就是地铁安逸惨,RL5," * The author expresses agreement with a prior statement or sentiment, emphasizing the convenience and comfort (""安逸惨"") of having a metro station right downstairs.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""下楼就是地铁"" (downstairs is the metro) — points to convenience of location.
  * ""安逸惨"" (extremely comfortable) — evaluative expression indicating high livability.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The phrase ""下楼就是地铁"" highlights functional accessibility and contributes to the perception of the area as comfortable and convenient.
  * ""安逸惨"" functions as an evaluative reinforcement, indicating that the presence of convenient infrastructure (metro) enhances the desirability or quality of the local area.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author links the presence of the metro to the area being “安逸” (comfortable), which implies a **positive evaluation of the area’s livability**.
  * This evaluation is not just about personal comfort but contributes to a **broader standard of what makes a place desirable or “local” in a valued sense**.
  * There is **no explicit mention** of territorial identity, cultural traits, family history, or administrative status.
  * The author is **not** defining who is local based on occupation, economic status, or social roots.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author is **defining or evaluating the quality of a “local” area** based on its **functional livability**, specifically the **presence of convenient transportation infrastructure (metro)**.
  * This fits **RL5**, as the author is **directly linking** metro access to the **evaluation of the area as “安逸” (comfortable/livable)**, which implies a standard for what constitutes a **desirable or “good” local area**.

"其实主要还是配套的原因
 1：从小长大的地方，内心上不认可其他地方，觉得那是乡下，北到伍家岭，南到南二环。
 2:最近快速发展的十来年里，人口增长了300万，其实三甲医疗并没有增加啥，交通拥挤，远距离的就医带来不便
 3:新城区房子确实很多，都是高层和超高层为主，人口密度就高，堵车就成为家常，比如月亮岛和梅溪湖等主干道区域，而老长沙反而没有那么堵，因为有很多6层楼的单位房，密度低些，就业也在附近

 5:真正要长期在一个城市待下去，从心里认可这个城市就必须移植到大脑的文化里，这样无论去哪里感觉还是老长沙比较好，完善便捷的配套是重中之重","RL1, RL3, RL4, RL5"," *   The author is expressing that the **core reason for identifying with and preferring ""old长沙 (Old Changsha)""** lies in its **cultural atmosphere, lower population density, better traffic flow, and more established, convenient facilities**. The author contrasts this with newer urban areas, which, despite having modern buildings and more housing, lack the cultural identity and livability of the old city. The author clearly implies that **""being local"" is tied not just to geography or administrative boundaries, but more importantly to cultural and lifestyle familiarity, as well as the quality of the living environment.**

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** Mentions of ""北到伍家岭，南到南二环"" and contrasting ""老长沙"" with ""新城区"" indicate a conventional mental map of what constitutes the core ""local"" area.
  *   **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History):** The phrase ""从小长大的地方，内心上不认可其他地方"" implies that **growing up in a place affects one’s sense of local belonging**.
  *   **RL4 (Cultural-Linguistic Recognition):** The phrase ""缺少了老长沙特有文化的烟火气"" suggests that **local culture and atmosphere** are important markers of local identity.
  *   **RL5 (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition):** The author repeatedly emphasizes **traffic, medical access, population density, and convenience** as key to feeling that a place is ""local"" and livable.
  *   **RL6 (Depth of Social Roots & Economic Status Symbolism):** The mention of ""单位房"" and density differences implies a contrast between **established residential communities** and newer, more transient developments, possibly hinting at deeper social roots in the old city.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   **RL1** is used to define the **mental boundaries of local identity**—what is ""truly local"" in the author’s perception.
  *   **RL3** supports the idea that **personal history in the area shapes emotional attachment and local identity**.
  *   **RL4** is used to contrast the **authenticity and cultural depth** of old Changsha with the superficiality of new urban areas.
  *   **RL5** is central to the author’s argument—**livability and convenience are key to accepting a place as ""home"" and thus ""local""**.
  *   **RL6** indirectly supports the idea that **established communities (vs. new developments)** have deeper local roots, though not strongly emphasized.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly **endorses** the following as criteria for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating ""local"" areas:
      *   Mental maps of local boundaries (RL1)
      *   Childhood growth history (RL3)
      *   Cultural atmosphere (RL4)
      *   Functional livability (RL5)

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author believes that to feel a place is truly ""local"", one must have grown up there (RL3), perceive it as the culturally authentic and historically rooted core area (RL1 and RL4), and experience it as functionally livable and convenient (RL5). These elements work together to support the author’s view that **""local identity"" is not just administrative or physical, but deeply tied to personal history, cultural familiarity, and quality of life.**

我只是发表个人感受，我住了3年梅溪湖，然后我老公就吐槽了三年，然后在房价没跌的时候果断卖掉了,RL5," * The author is sharing a personal anecdote about living in Meixihu (梅溪湖) for three years. While the author may not explicitly oppose living there, the husband's continuous complaints and the decision to sell the property when the price hadn't dropped suggest an underlying negative evaluation of the area as a desirable ""local"" living space.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * ""住了3年梅溪湖"" (lived in Meixihu for 3 years) – potentially related to **RL3** (individual growth history/local experience) and **RL1** (territorial identity).
  * ""我老公就吐槽了三年"" (my husband complained for three years) – suggests dissatisfaction with the area, possibly related to **RL5** (livability criteria).
  * ""在房价没跌的时候果断卖掉了"" (sold it decisively when the price didn't drop) – implies a judgment on the area's future value or desirability, potentially linked to **RL5** or **RL6**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author lived in Meixihu for three years, which could imply some degree of local integration (RL3/RL1), but the husband’s continuous complaints and the decision to sell despite stable prices suggest that **the author does not view Meixihu as a high-quality or desirable ""local"" residential area**.
  * The husband's dissatisfaction and the decision to sell when prices didn’t drop **strongly imply a judgment about the area’s livability or future potential**, aligning with **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The key RL element endorsed by the author is **RL5**, as the narrative implies that the area failed to meet the author’s expectations for a desirable or stable local living environment — evidenced by the husband’s complaints and the decision to sell.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author indirectly conveys that **Meixihu is not perceived as an ideal or stable ""local"" residential area**, based on underlying dissatisfaction and the timing of the property sale. This aligns with **RL5**, where the author implicitly uses **livability and environmental quality cognition** as a standard for evaluating the area's local value.

所以我喜欢北辰，老城区往新区的过渡，街道界面没老城区那么破旧，离市中心又只需要十几分钟，配套啥都有，住起来太舒服哒,"RL1, RL5"," The author expresses a positive sentiment toward **Beichen** (北辰), describing it as a comfortable place to live due to its **location between the old city and the new district**, **relatively new streets**, **proximity to the city center**, and **complete facilities**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity**
    - ""老城区往新区的过渡"" (transition from old city to new district) — indicates a **mental map** or **spatial perception** of the area’s position within the city.
    - ""离市中心又只需要十几分钟"" (only ten minutes from the city center) — implies a **symbolic spatial boundary** or **cognitive proximity** to what is considered the ""core"" or ""desirable"" area.
  - **RL5: Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition**
    - ""配套啥都有"" (has all facilities), ""住起来太舒服哒"" (very comfortable to live) — directly link **functional livability** and **residential quality** to the **evaluation of the area as a good local place to live**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **RL1 elements** serve to position Beichen as a **symbolically favorable transitional zone**, not too far from the center and not as outdated as the old city. This contributes to the author’s perception of it as a **desirable local residential area**.
  - The **RL5 elements** are the **main evaluative criteria** used by the author to justify why Beichen is a **comfortable and ideal local place to live**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL1** and **RL5** are **endorsed by the author** and **used to evaluate the ""local"" area's quality and desirability**.
  - There is no mention of administrative boundaries (RL2), family history (RL3), language (RL4), social networks or assets (RL6), or occupation (RL7), so those are not applicable.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1** applies because the author **constructs a spatial identity for Beichen** based on its transitional location and cognitive proximity to the city center, reflecting a **socially conventional territorial identity**.
  - **RL5** applies because the author **explicitly evaluates Beichen as a high-quality local residential area** based on its **livability and facilities**.

They imply that being a ""local"" in Changsha involves having a perception of space and distance that reflects long-term rootedness and familiarity with the city's relatively small scale. The phrase “我的附近是能双脚到达” (my nearby can be reached on foot) subtly conveys a sense of local belonging defined by a lifestyle and spatial cognition shaped by growing up in a small-scale city.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * “小时候的感知” (childhood perception) → **RL3**
  * “从侯家塘到步行街” (from Houjiaxiang to the pedestrian street) → **RL1**
  * “开车一不留神就出了长沙市” (drove absentmindedly and left Changsha) → **RL1**
  * “我的附近是能双脚到达” (my nearby can be reached on foot) → **RL1**, possibly **RL3**

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * **RL1 Elements:**
    * The descriptions of spatial cognition (e.g., easily driving out of the city, the smallness of the city, and walking as a mode of transport) suggest that the author is constructing a **mentally mapped, socially conventional understanding of Changsha as a small, compact city** where proximity and ease of movement are part of the local identity.
    * These elements are **not just observations about city size**, but are used to contrast with other cities and to define what it means to be a local — someone who sees and lives within a small-scale, walkable city.
  * **RL3 Elements:**
    * The author's childhood perception and long-term familiarity with the city imply that being a local is tied to **growing up in the area**, forming a foundational spatial understanding that differs from outsiders.
    * This supports the idea that **local identity is rooted in early life experiences**, which contrasts with transient or newer residents.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author clearly **endorses** a definition of local identity based on:
    * **Mentally mapped, small-scale spatial cognition** (RL1) — the author implies that being a local means having a different sense of distance and proximity shaped by growing up in a small city.
    * **Rootedness through childhood experience** (RL3) — the author contrasts their own local perception with that of outsiders (e.g., the Wuhan relative), implying that local identity is shaped by long-term, formative experiences in the city.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * The author’s local identity construction is based on **socially conventional territorial identity (RL1)** and **family historical rootedness / individual growth history (RL3)**.
  * These elements work together to suggest that a ""local"" person in Changsha is someone who has a specific mental map and sense of proximity shaped by growing up in the city — a sense that differs from outsiders and even from residents of other cities.

The phrase carries a tone of **regional identity differentiation**, **social distance**, and **implicit hierarchy** between the speaker and the ""二环的乡里"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   **""二环""** – a territorial reference, potentially indicating a socially conventional boundary of a local area.
  *   **""乡里""** – a term that implies **rural origin**, **local identity**, or **regional background**, possibly tied to **cultural-linguistic** or **territorial** distinctions.
  *   The **contrast** between the speaker and the ""二环的乡里"" implies a **social boundary** or **identity distinction**, potentially rooted in **territorial identity**, **cultural perception**, or **social hierarchy**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   ""二环"" functions as a **symbolic boundary** — it is not just a geographical location but a **socially recognized zone** that carries connotations of local identity or rural background.
  *   ""乡里"" functions as a **cultural-linguistic and territorial marker** — it implies people from a rural background, possibly with a distinct dialect, customs, or social status.
  *   The phrase suggests that the speaker **does not identify** with the ""二环的乡里"" and **implicitly distances** themselves from this group, indicating that the speaker uses **territorial identity** and **cultural background** to define who is considered “local” or “us”.

  *   The author **implicitly endorses** the idea that people from ""二环"" are **not part of the speaker’s local group**, suggesting a **socially conventional territorial identity** (RL1).
  *   The term ""乡里"" implies **cultural-linguistic** or **rural identity**, and the speaker's distancing from this group suggests that **cultural-linguistic recognition** (RL4) is also part of the **implicit criteria** used to distinguish ""local"" from ""non-local"".

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity):** The phrase implies that ""二环"" is **not considered part of the speaker’s local identity**, based on **socially conventional mental maps** or **symbolic boundaries**. The speaker treats ""二环"" as **outside the core local area**.

小时候在五一广场出生长大的，结婚之后住在梅溪湖，爸妈说我是到乡里去了说鸟不拉屎的地方,"**  
RL1, RL3"," The author is expressing a personal anecdote about their life trajectory — being born and raised in a central, presumably well-known area (""五一广场"",五一广场, Wuyi Square), and then moving to Meixihu (梅溪湖) after marriage. The parents’ comment reflects a negative evaluation of Meixihu as a ""desolate"" or ""undeveloped"" place — ""鸟不拉屎的地方"" (a place not even birds would defecate in). This implies a contrast between areas considered ""central/local"" versus ""peripheral/non-local"" based on **socially conventional perceptions of prestige and centrality**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - ""小时候在五一广场出生长大"" — suggests **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**, as it indicates being born and raised in a specific local area.
  - ""爸妈说我是到乡里去了"" — suggests **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, because the parents are applying a conventional or habitual understanding of place value, labeling Meixihu as ""乡里"" (countryside), which implies it's not truly ""local"" or urban.
  - ""说鸟不拉屎的地方"" — also supports **RL1**, as it reflects a socially conventional, emotionally charged judgment of the area’s desirability or centrality.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of being born and raised in Wuyi Square (RL3) serves to establish the author's **genuine local identity** — they were originally rooted in a core local area.
  - The parents' judgment of Meixihu as ""乡里"" and ""鸟不拉屎的地方"" (RL1) functions to contrast ""true local"" areas with peripheral or less prestigious ones. The author seems to **accept or at least convey this contrast as valid**, even if not explicitly agreeing, by presenting it as the parents' opinion and framing it as a meaningful distinction.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author's **own rootedness in a core area** (Wuyi Square) is presented as a contrast to their current location (Meixihu), implying that this rootedness is significant in defining ""localness"" — this supports **RL3**.
  - The parents’ perception of Meixihu as ""countryside"" and undesirable reflects a **socially conventional view of territory**, which the author conveys as a legitimate or commonly accepted framework — this supports **RL1**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** is reflected in the socially accepted distinction between urban core (五一广场) and peripheral/rural (梅溪湖), even if the latter may be developed. The author conveys this conventional view as part of the discourse.
  - **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** is clearly present in the author's own background — being born and raised in a central area, which implicitly gives them a stronger claim to being ""local"".

**Output:**

么子叫老城区咯，侯家塘算不？算的话，你去看看天剑路那里，那未必住起蛮舒服？还一句言老城区不堵车，不晓得哪里来的优越感,None," The author is questioning the definition of what constitutes the ""old city area"" (老城区), specifically challenging whether侯家塘 (Houjiatang) qualifies. They imply that侯家塘 may not be a comfortable place to live (e.g., referencing 天剑路 as possibly uncomfortable) and mock the notion that the old city area is not congested, suggesting that such a belief lacks grounding and reflects misplaced superiority.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author questions the **geographical scope** of the ""old city area"" — this points to **RL1** (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity).
  - The author evaluates the **livability** of侯家塘 (possibly not being comfortable to live in), which relates to **RL5** (Functional Livability & Environmental Quality Cognition).
  - The author mocks the idea that the old city area is not congested — this is not just a critique of traffic, but a **challenge to the perceived symbolic value or superiority** of the old city area, which again ties into **RL1** and **RL5**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL1**: The author is challenging the conventional understanding of what constitutes the ""old city area"" — suggesting that including Houjiatang may not be widely accepted or consistent with the symbolic meaning of ""old city.""
  - **RL5**: The author uses livability (comfort of living) as a **criterion to question whether Houjiatang deserves to be considered part of the ""old city""**, implying it does not meet the standard.
  - The sarcastic tone about traffic and comfort suggests the author **does not endorse the commonly held view** that the old city area is superior or inherently more desirable.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author is **not endorsing** the idea that Houjiatang is part of the ""old city area"" or that the old city area is superior.
  - They are **critiquing or resisting** the conventional view of what constitutes the ""old city"" and the assumptions of superiority tied to it.
  - Therefore, **no RL categories are being endorsed by the author** as criteria for defining local identity in this text.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The text does not present any criteria that the author **explicitly or implicitly endorses** for defining ""local identity"" or evaluating the scope of ""local areas.""
  - Instead, it questions and mocks existing perceptions, which means those perceptions are not the author’s own.

哪有那么多原因，就是习惯了啊，家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在。另外，南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路。,"RL1, RL3, RL6"," *   The author is explaining why they live where they do — not because of a list of reasons, but mainly due to habit and familiarity. They also define a boundary of their local area, stating that ""south of the Second South Ring Road is out of the question"" and that ""at most, it's Labor Road."" This implies a **mental map** or **accepted boundary** of what they consider the local area.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   ""就是习惯了啊，家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在"" — suggests a **habitual, socially rooted connection** to the area.
  *   ""南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路"" — indicates a **conventional territorial boundary** or **mental map** of where the local area begins and ends.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  *   The first part emphasizes **habit and social rootedness**, suggesting that being local is not about objective criteria but about familiarity and social embeddedness — which supports **RL3** and **RL6**.
  *   The second part defines **mental boundaries** of the local area, not based on administrative lines but on **socially conventional understanding** — which supports **RL1**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author clearly implies that:
      - Being ""local"" is about where you grew up and where your family and friends are (RL3).
      - Local identity is also about accepted or conventional spatial understanding — e.g., Labor Road is acceptable, but not the Second South Ring Road (RL1).
      - The social network and embeddedness in the area also play a role in defining local identity (RL6).

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author's view of ""local"" is rooted in **habit, social ties, and spatial mental maps**. They do not use administrative boundaries or cultural markers, but rather **conventional spatial understanding (RL1)**, **familiarity and growth history (RL3)**, and **social rootedness (RL6)**.

The author also explains that **Yuelu District's Party Committee and Government work in conjunction** with the **Xiangjiang New Area's Party Working Committee and Management Committee**, indicating a **coordinated administrative structure**.

This statement is not about personal identity or cultural belonging, but rather about **how territory and governance are organized**, and by implication, **who has the authority to define or represent the ""local"" administrative or political identity**.

---

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- **湘江新区是功能区而非行政区** —— This indicates that **Xiangjiang New Area is not an administrative entity**, thus **excluding RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** as a defining feature of ""local identity"" in this context.
- **岳麓区委、区政府与湘江新区党工委、管委会实行区政合一的运行方式** —— This implies a **blending or coordination of administrative and functional governance**, which relates to **how authority and identity are defined within the local system**.

---

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
- The author is **defining the boundaries of administrative legitimacy** — what counts as an **official administrative unit** and what does not. This is a **direct statement about how local identity should or should not be defined administratively**.
- The author is **rejecting the idea that Xiangjiang New Area is an administrative region**, which implies that **one should not use its administrative label to define local identity**.
- The reference to **""区政合一"" (district-administration integration)** is a **functional explanation of how local governance is structured**, which again reinforces the **administrative framework** as the **legitimate basis for defining local identity**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **explicitly defines what is not a valid administrative basis** for defining local identity (湘江新区 is not an administrative region).
- The author **implicitly endorses the combined structure of岳麓区 and 湘江新区 as the legitimate administrative basis** for defining local governance and, by extension, **local identity**.

你看看现在有没有岳麓区人民法院，岳麓区zf，地图上是显示岳麓区还是湘江新区，湘江新区只是经济发展上的特殊区划，又不是行政区划,"RL1, RL2"," The author is questioning the administrative legitimacy and social recognition of湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New District) in comparison to岳麓区 (Yuelu District). They point out that湘江新区 is only a special economic development zone and not an official administrative division, implying that this distinction is important in determining what constitutes a ""real"" local area or local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author references the presence (or absence) of official institutions like岳麓区人民法院 (Yuelu District People's Court) and岳麓区zf (Yuelu District government).
  - They question whether岳麓区 or湘江新区 appears on maps, indicating a concern with territorial identity and public perception.
  - The distinction between economic zones and administrative zones is emphasized, suggesting a belief that only administrative legitimacy defines true local identity.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The mention of official institutions (court, government) and administrative boundaries plays a key role in the author's argument that湘江新区 is not a legitimate local identity category.
  - The question about how岳麓区 and湘江新区 are represented on maps serves to support the author's view that only officially recognized administrative areas (like岳麓区) should be considered ""local"".
  - The author resists the idea that economic or developmental status (湘江新区 as a special economic zone) should influence local identity.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author clearly endorses the idea that administrative legitimacy (RL2) is the correct criterion for defining ""local"".
  - They reject the relevance of economic or developmental zoning (湘江新区) in defining local identity.
  - The author also implies a conventional territorial identity (RL1) by questioning how areas are represented on maps and in public perception.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy** – The author emphasizes the presence of official institutions and administrative status as the basis for defining ""local"".
  - **RL1: Socially Conventional Territorial Identity** – The author questions how岳麓区 and湘江新区 are displayed on maps and in public recognition, implying that social perception and conventional understanding of territory matter in defining ""local"".

确实，湘江新区只是个功能区，行政区还是叫岳麓区，湘江新区相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方,RL2**," The author is clarifying the distinction and relationship between湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New District) and岳麓区 (Yuelu District). The author emphasizes that although湘江新区 is a functional zone, it is not an administrative entity, and the true administrative identity still belongs to岳麓区, with湘江新区 encompassing parts of both岳麓区 and望城区 (Wangcheng District). This reflects the author’s understanding and endorsement of the administrative division logic in defining local identity.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  * The phrase “湘江新区只是个功能区，行政区还是叫岳麓区” indicates that the author distinguishes between functional zones and administrative districts.
  * The statement “湘江新区相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方” suggests a geographic and administrative boundary understanding.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  * The author uses administrative identity to clarify the true local identity of the area. Functional zones are not seen as legitimate for defining local identity — only administrative divisions (such as岳麓区) are valid in this context.
  * The author implicitly supports the idea that administrative legitimacy (RL2) is the correct standard for defining local identity, and functional or developmental zones (like湘江新区) do not carry the same legitimacy.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  * The author explicitly endorses the administrative boundary (岳麓区) as the correct basis for defining local identity.
  * Functional zones (湘江新区) are described as lacking administrative legitimacy and are thus not used to define local identity.
  * The criteria related to administrative legitimacy (RL2) are clearly endorsed and used in the author’s argument.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  * This aligns with **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**, as the author uses administrative boundaries and affiliations as the standard for defining local identity.
  * The author rejects the idea that functional zones (which lack formal administrative status) can define local identity, reinforcing the importance of administrative legitimacy.

She contrasts “real city areas” (like Tianxin and the old Puzi Street) with peripheral zones (like Yuhua, Kaifu, and especially Yuelu, Wangcheng, and Tiaoma), which are seen as rural or undeveloped. Her personal experience and her husband’s background are used to reinforce this perception.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
- Reference to **which areas “count” as urban/local**: Tianxin, Puzi Street vs. Yuhua, Kaifu, Yuelu, Tiaoma, Wangcheng
- Use of **historical and emotional labeling**: “old city area”, “little broken piece”, “wilderness”
- Mention of **personal and family rootedness**: “I live here”, “my husband is a native of Puzi Street”
- Implicit **mental mapping and social segregation** between areas

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
- The author uses **RL1-type logic** (socially conventional territorial identity) to define which areas are “really” considered local or urban.
- She also uses **RL3-type logic** (family rootedness) to support the legitimacy of her viewpoint by referencing her husband’s birthplace in the “old city”.
- These elements **construct a legitimacy framework** for defining “local” that is **based on emotional and historical perception**, not legal or functional criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
- The author **clearly endorses** the idea that certain areas (like Puzi Street) are the “real” local urban core, while others are not — this aligns with **RL1**.
- She also **implicitly values rootedness** in the “old city” as a marker of authentic local identity — this aligns with **RL3**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
- **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**: The author constructs a mental map of the city where only certain historically rooted and socially accepted areas (e.g., Puzi Street) are considered truly local or urban.
- **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)**: She reinforces this perception by emphasizing her husband’s identity as a “native of Puzi Street”, implying that such rootedness carries symbolic weight in defining local identity.

小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，然后去了捞刀河，接着又住到暮云，最后住到了梅溪湖，变成了xlb 哈哈哈哈哈哈,"**

None of the RL categories apply."," The author is humorously recounting their life trajectory of moving through various neighborhoods or districts in Changsha (e.g., 南门口, 八角亭, 捞刀河, 暮云, 梅溪湖), ending up in 梅溪湖 and jokingly referring to themselves as an ""xlb"" — a colloquial and sometimes derogatory term for people who recently moved into upscale areas and are seen as pretentious or lacking authentic local roots. The tone is self-deprecating and ironic, and the author is implicitly reflecting on how place of residence is linked to identity perception.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The author lists multiple locations lived in during different life stages, indicating a **non-rooted, mobile growth history**.
  - The final move to 梅溪湖 (a relatively new and upscale area) and the use of ""xlb"" implies a **change in perceived local identity**, possibly tied to **cultural-linguistic perception** or **social roots**.
  - The author seems to **reject the idea of rooted local identity** by mocking their own transient residential history and self-identifying with a term that others might use to mock them.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - The **list of places lived** functions to **undermine the idea of deep rootedness** in any one location, which contrasts with RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
  - The final identification with “xlb” is **ironic self-labeling**, possibly mocking how others judge or define ""local"" or ""genuine resident"" based on **residential location** or **cultural identity**.
  - The author is **not affirming** any criteria for defining local identity; they are **mocking or resisting** such criteria.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - The author **does not endorse** any specific standard for defining ""local identity"".
  - The author **resists or mocks** the idea that where you live (especially ending up in 梅溪湖) makes you a certain kind of person (i.e., ""xlb"").
  - Therefore, **no RL criteria are explicitly or implicitly endorsed** by the author as legitimate standards for defining local identity.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The text **does not present any endorsed criteria** for defining local identity.
  - It **resists or critiques** the idea that moving to certain areas makes one a certain type of person, thus **negating** potential RL3 or RL6 interpretations.
  - Therefore, **no RL category applies**.

哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,"**  
RL3"," The author is making a distinction between rural and urban identities, implying that being from the countryside (""乡里"") is different from being a city person (""城里人""). The statement carries a tone of identity categorization and possibly a value judgment, suggesting that rural identity is not equivalent to being a ""local"" in an urban context.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  The key phrase is “哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,” which contrasts rural and urban identities. This suggests a distinction based on **place of origin** or **upbringing**, which could relate to **RL3 (Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History)** or **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**, depending on how it's framed.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  The author is not merely describing a phenomenon but is **drawing a boundary** between rural and urban identities. The phrase implies that **origin or upbringing in a rural area disqualifies one from being considered a ""city person""**, suggesting that **growing up in an urban environment is a criterion for being considered a true local** in that context.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  The author is **endorsing the idea** that one’s **place of origin or early life environment** affects their status as a local (or not), which aligns with **RL3**. The author is not just describing a difference but is **using rural/urban origin as a standard for local identity evaluation**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  The statement reflects a belief that being a true ""local"" (specifically a city person) depends on **not being from the countryside**, which is closely tied to **RL3: Family Historical Rootedness / Individual Growth History**. The author is implying that **growing up in the city is a prerequisite for being a ""real"" local**, and that rural origin disqualifies one from this identity.

我在五一广场 有个同事不知道我们经理就是那个月亮岛那里的，然后他就说乡里别 然后我们经理就说那里已经属于是开发区了，不属于是乡里了，然后我同事还没理解意思，一直在吐槽那里不好不好，结果我们经理就背后面针对他，懂得都懂,"** RL1, RL2"," The author is recounting a situation where a colleague unknowingly insults the origin of their manager (who is from Moon Island), by calling it ""xiang li"" (countryside/rural area), and the manager corrects him by stating that Moon Island is now part of the **development zone**, not the countryside. The colleague continues to criticize the area, leading the manager to take offense and retaliate. The key expressive intent is that the author implies that **perceptions of local identity are tied to administrative and symbolic changes in regional status**, and that **disrespecting this new status can have social consequences**.

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  - The manager emphasizes that Moon Island is now part of the **development zone** → **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)**.
  - The colleague's dismissal of the area as ""xiang li"" implies a **hierarchical perception of local identity based on territorial status** → this is not directly the author's view, but the author **does not resist** it and implies it has consequences.
  - The manager's reaction implies that **territorial identity carries social weight**, and being associated with a newly upgraded area like a development zone grants **symbolic legitimacy** → **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)**.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements in the Author's Core Argument**
  - **RL2** functions to show that **administrative reclassification can redefine local identity**, and the manager uses this to assert legitimacy and distance from a rural label.
  - **RL1** functions to illustrate that **territorial identity is not just administrative but also socially meaningful**, and **disrespecting it can result in social consequences**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  - Both **RL1** and **RL2** are used by the author to imply that **territorial identity is shaped by both administrative changes and the associated social perception**, and that **these changes affect social dynamics and personal treatment**.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  - The author uses **RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** by showing that being part of a development zone is a new basis for defining local identity.
  - The author also uses **RL1 (Socially Conventional Territorial Identity)** to show that **territorial labels carry social meaning**, and that **calling a place ""countryside"" can be seen as a social slight**, especially after its status has changed.

住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,RL1," *   The author is making a clear distinction about identity, stating that even though someone may live in a place (北正街, Beizheng Street), they are still considered as belonging to the countryside (乡里) rather than the urban core. This implies a nuanced judgment about who truly counts as ""urban local"" versus ""rural local"".

**Step 2: Identify All Potential RL Elements**
  *   The key phrase is “住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人” — ""those who live on Beizheng Street are considered city people among the countryside.""
  *   This suggests a **hierarchical or relative definition of ""local"" identity**, where location alone is not sufficient to confer ""urban local"" status.
  *   The author implies that Beizheng Street is not fully recognized as part of the urban core — it is seen as a marginal or transitional space.

**Step 3: Analyze the ""Functional Role"" of RL Elements**
  *   The phrase is used to **highlight a socially conventional understanding of spatial identity** — that is, even though Beizheng Street may be physically in the city, it is not symbolically or socially accepted as part of the true ""urban local"" identity.
  *   The author seems to be **endorsing the idea that there is a mental map or social perception that distinguishes ""true city people"" from those who are only nominally in the city**.

**Step 4: Filter RL Criteria Related to the Core Argument and Endorsed by the Author**
  *   The author is **endorsing a socially conventional way of defining local identity**, which includes **symbolic boundaries and mental maps** that distinguish between core and peripheral areas.
  *   There is **no mention of administrative boundaries, cultural-linguistic traits, or economic factors** directly tied to the definition of ""local"" in this sentence.

**Step 5: Precisely Match RL Categories and Construct an Explanation**
  *   The author is using a **socially conventional territorial identity** to define who counts as ""local"" — in this case, distinguishing between the symbolic urban core and the periphery (Beizheng Street).
  *   This aligns with **RL1**, which focuses on **socially conventional regional cognition, symbolic meaning, and mental maps used to define local identity and boundaries**.
