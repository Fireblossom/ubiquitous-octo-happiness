- 三环内土著 (locals inside the Third Ring Road): do not discriminate against outsiders (外地人).  
- 三环外人 (people outside the Third Ring Road): are discriminated against by locals inside the Third Ring Road.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic behind each viewpoint  
- The distinction between inside and outside the Third Ring Road reflects a collective, habitual local spatial cognition that assigns identity and social attitudes based on intra-city spatial boundaries not defined by administrative divisions.  
- The notion that locals inside the Third Ring Road discriminate against those outside shows that the author recognizes and accepts this spatial boundary as a criterion for defining who is a 'real local' and who is not.  
- The mention of moving to Tianfu New Area (likely outside traditional core) is descriptive but does not negate the core spatial identity logic.  
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.

- 五城区 (Five urban districts)

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
1. 南门: ""南门那边都是外地来打工的"" — South Gate area residents are migrant workers, not real locals.
2. 天府新区: ""一堆农民拆迁的，整体素质不高"" — Tianfu New Area populated by relocated farmers, overall quality not high.
3. 华阳，龙泉: ""也能叫成都？只认五城区哈"" — Huayang and Longquan are not considered part of Chengdu; only Five urban districts are recognized.
4. 五城区: ""土生土长的本地人都是享受生活的"" — True locals born and raised in the Five urban districts enjoy life.
5. ""除了五城区，都是郊区"" — Except for Five urban districts, all other areas are suburbs.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic behind each viewpoint
- The author clearly distinguishes ""real locals"" by specific urban spatial boundaries, emphasizing only the Five urban districts as authentic Chengdu, excluding Tianfu New Area, Huayang, Longquan, and other suburbs. This reflects a **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**, based on habitual local perceptions and symbolic urban boundaries rather than administrative divisions.
- The mention that South Gate is populated by migrant workers and Tianfu New Area by relocated farmers associates specific occupations/social groups with local identity, reflecting **Occupational Typification (RL7)**.
- The phrase ""土生土长的本地人"" (born and raised locals) indicates emphasis on family rootedness, i.e., generational localness, indicating **Family Rootedness (RL3)**.
- The evaluation of ""整体素质不高"" (overall quality not high) for Tianfu New Area could relate to social embeddedness or functional livability, but the author uses it to dismiss the area's legitimacy as ""real Chengdu,"" which aligns more with occupational and spatial perceptions rather than direct livability standards.
- The personal reflection about ""土著"" (natives) showing social attitudes does not provide a direct standard for defining ""local person"" identity and thus is not annotated.

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
- Local natives with strong economic conditions (multiple houses, high retirement pensions) naturally unwilling to marry farming families without retirement pensions.
- This is unrelated to whether someone is a local native of Chengdu; it is a nationwide phenomenon.
- Marriages depend on economic compatibility (""门当户对""), not regional origin.
- If both families have similar moderate economic conditions and suitable pensions, then no problem.
- The selection is based on economic factors and family conditions, not on regional identity.
- Wealthy families in county towns would also be selective; this is an economic issue, not related to regional identity.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The author explicitly states that economic conditions and family background are the main standards in marriage choices.
- The author denies that local/native identity or regional origin (""是不是成都土著"") plays a role in this selection.
- The author treats the issue as an economic problem, unrelated to regional or local identity standards.
- No indication that the author uses economic status or family conditions as standards to define who is a ""local person.""
- Therefore, no recognition logic related to defining ""local person"" identity is endorsed.
- The discussion is about social stratification in marriage choice, not about local identity definition.

- 龙洞: Does not care whether it belongs to Jinan urban area or not, only cares about being the most expensive.
- 济南市区: Mentioned as a reference for city area, but author implies that belonging to this administrative or spatial area is not important.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- Author points out that 龙洞 (Longdong) does not care about administrative or spatial belonging (e.g., to Jinan city proper).
- The focus is on price/value (""most expensive""), which is a discussion of wealth or status but does not explicitly or implicitly define ""local person"" identity.
- Since the author states 龙洞 does not care about belonging to city proper, no endorsement of administrative or vernacular spatial logic.
- The emphasis on price/value is not a standard for defining ""local person"" identity.

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。","Output: Recognition Logic 1, Recognition Logic 2, Recognition Logic 4, Recognition Logic 5, Recognition Logic 6","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text

- 黄岛 (Huangdao)
- 即墨 (Jimo)
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)
- 莱西 (Laixi)
- 市南区 (Shinan District)
- 主城区 (main urban area)
- Various districts and counties of Qingdao city

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
- 城阳、黄岛、即墨、胶州、莱西: These districts/counties are administratively part of Qingdao but are ""excluded"" or ""not considered"" part of Qingdao by some main urban residents (""大姨们"").
- 主城区 residents do not recognize people from other districts/counties as true ""Qingdao people.""
- Education system segregation prevents students from these districts from accessing key city schools, showing social and administrative boundary-based exclusion.
- Dialect/accent differences between main urban area residents (more Mandarin-like) and local residents in other districts (more local dialect), used as a basis for identity differentiation.
- Road traffic segregation with tolls between main urban areas and other districts causes psychological and practical separation.
- Psychological superiority and exclusion by main urban immigrants, a form of spatial and cultural boundary.
- Economic development imbalance, with main urban districts having higher per capita income, reinforcing exclusion.
- Those excluded from ""Qingdao"" status face discrimination and respond with resistance.
- The author emphasizes the ""城郊对立"" (urban-suburban opposition) as the core issue, noting that administratively all these districts belong to Qingdao, but social recognition excludes some areas.
- The overall argument critiques exclusion based on spatial, administrative, linguistic, economic, and cultural grounds, advocating for integration and equality.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The notion of ""not counting as Qingdao"" by main urban residents reflects a vernacular spatial boundary that overrides administrative boundaries, emphasizing a cultural and emotional map of ""urban core"" vs. ""suburbs"" or ""periphery.""
- RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy): The text clarifies that administratively all districts belong to Qingdao, and the exclusion is social, not legal, highlighting the contrast between administrative legitimacy and vernacular recognition.
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): Dialect and accent differences are emphasized as a key identity marker and source of superiority/inferiority feelings.
- RL5 (Functional Livability): Discussion of infrastructure issues like segregated education resources and road tolls affecting convenience and integration points to functional livability factors in local identity and inclusion.
- RL6 (Social Embeddedness): References to social discrimination, community belonging, and economic disparities (income differences) relate to social embeddedness and economic status symbolism.
- RL7 (Occupational Typification): Although less explicit, the mention of immigrants and ""老德意志正黑旗"" (old German flag) cultural heritage points to social groups and occupational or cultural typifications shaping identity, but this is less direct.

- 市南 and 地铁: Locations where these people are recognized or liked
- 大姨: Older women in these areas who show preference for highly educated returnees

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The text associates a specific area (市南) and the local social group (大姨) with preferences for certain occupational/educational types (highly educated returnees).
- This implies that occupational or social status types are used as a basis for social recognition or acceptance within certain areas.
- Therefore, the author implicitly endorses occupational typification as a standard for defining local social identity or acceptance.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- Author discusses boundaries and inclusion of various districts and towns within ""Qingdao,"" expressing a personal spatial cognition of what counts as ""Qingdao.""
- The distinctions are based on the author's personal understanding of city scope, proximity, and sense of belonging rather than official administrative boundaries.

- The emphasis on convenience (""肯定便利"") and the positive living environment suggests the author uses material and functional living conditions as a standard for evaluating the area.
- The metaphor ""the center of the universe"" indicates a high status or desirability of the area, linked to livability factors.
- There is no explicit or implicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types.

- The author discusses spatial and perceptual distinctions between old city and new districts, noting outsiders' recognition and familiarity as a factor.
- Mentions the old city as core and having symbolic importance.
- Talks about urban landscape and infrastructure (tunnels, elevated roads) influencing city image.
- The mention of outsiders' recognition and familiarity with certain districts indicates a collective perception or emotional mapping of the city's spatial divisions.
- The focus is on how different areas are perceived culturally and symbolically, rather than administrative boundaries or family roots.
- The author implies that the old city is considered the core and more representative of the city identity, while new districts are less integrated into the local recognition.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic behind each viewpoint expression
- The author uses subjective evaluations about areas based on their spatial location relative to the city center (""very far""), urban vs suburban vs rural distinctions, and social impressions (wealthy people, fashionable people, old houses, tourist traps).
- The ""very far"" repeated many times indicates a vernacular spatial authority on what is considered central or peripheral in the city.
- Descriptions like ""villa area,"" ""fashionable and wealthy people,"" ""many tourist traps"" imply social embeddedness and occupational or class typification, but the author mainly expresses impressions tied to the spatial and social characteristics of these areas.
- The mention of suburbs and recreational places (reservoir, peaches, barbecue) implies a vernacular understanding of area functions and symbolic meanings.
- The author does not explicitly mention administrative boundaries or family roots.
- The core logic seems to be collective local spatial cognition (RL1) combined with social embeddedness (RL6) and some hints of occupational typification (RL7) through references to wealthy people and social status.

- The author lists various districts or counties in Beijing with associated landmarks, characteristics, or personal impressions.
- Some entries note historical or cultural landmarks (故宫, 南锣鼓巷, 景山公园, 慕田峪长城, 八达岭长城, 周口店猿人遗址).
- Some mention personal or social experiences (e.g., ""初高中折磨我6年"" in Haidian, ""对象在内块上过学"" in Mentougou, ""超级合生汇"" in Changping).
- Others include comments on local lifestyle or reputation (""太爱吹牛逼"" in Tongzhou, ""别墅 有钱的多"" in Shunyi, ""口音好重"" in Pinggu).
- The tone is informal, combining cultural, social, and experiential notes to describe each area.
- The author seems to be using these place-based cultural and social associations to characterize the areas, reflecting a vernacular spatial perception.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic behind the viewpoint statements
- The author implicitly uses a vernacular spatial authority (RL1) by associating each district with symbolic landmarks, social stereotypes, and cultural impressions, which represent collective emotional maps rather than administrative or formal definitions.
- There is mention of dialect/accent (""口音好重"" in Pinggu), reflecting linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).
- References to social experiences and local social environments (schools, friends, lifestyle) suggest some social embeddedness (RL6), but these are not explicitly used to define ""local person"" identity.
- No explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, or occupational typification as criteria for local identity.
- Overall, the main focus is on vernacular spatial perceptions and some linguistic-cultural recognition.

- 街道（镇）、小区（村） (current administrative or community units)
- 外地的朋友 (friends from outside the area)

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
- 老辈区的概念不强: The older generation's concept of district is weak due to frequent administrative boundary changes.
- 本地人只会说自己待的地方的地名: Local people identify with very local place names (like 凤山门 etc.) rather than broader district names.
- 现在的街道（镇）、小区（村）概念: Current recognized units are streets (towns) and communities (villages).
- 对外地朋友才用区来表述: Locals use district names only when talking to outsiders unfamiliar with local place names.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The author emphasizes that local identity is tied to very fine-grained local place names rather than formal administrative districts.
- Points out that older generation's concept of district boundaries is weak due to multiple administrative changes, so they rely on habitual local spatial knowledge.
- The use of local place names as core identifiers reflects the author endorsing vernacular spatial authority (RL1) as the standard for defining local identity.
- The mention of administrative divisions is described as confusing and less relevant to locals' self-identification.

- 老余杭: People who say they are from Old Yuhang are considered ""乡下人"" (country bumpkins) by some locals from the urban city area.
- 杭州: Author initially identified as from Hangzhou but was criticized for not having a house in the urban area, so not truly a Hangzhou person.
- 市区: Local people from the city proper consider owning a house in the city as a criterion for being a ""real"" Hangzhou person.
- Author now prefers to say they are from ""杭州郊区"" (Hangzhou suburbs) or ""老余杭"" (Old Yuhang), recognizing the social distinction.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The distinction between Old Yuhang (suburban/rural area) and Hangzhou city proper reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic, based on collective social perceptions about which areas ""count"" as the city.
- The mention of owning a house in the city proper as a criterion suggests the presence of social embeddedness (property ownership) as a recognition standard, but the author is reporting others' judgments, not explicitly endorsing it.
- The author accepts the vernacular spatial boundary by choosing to identify as from the suburb or Old Yuhang rather than claiming full city identity.

- Author expresses lack of belonging and that others do not consider them ""one of us,"" indicating a boundary in local identity recognition.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The distinction between Yuhang and the city proper (downtown) reflects a vernacular spatial cognition about which areas ""count"" as the core local city and which do not.
- This is a collective social perception about urban spatial boundaries, not based on administrative divisions.
- The expressed lack of belonging and exclusion by others is based on this spatial identity boundary.

- 周边 (surrounding areas)
- 城镇户口 (urban hukou)
- 父母是工人或事业单位公务员 (parents are workers or public servants)
- 家里没有土地 (no family land)

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
- The author questions the definition of '乡下' (rural), challenging the notion by pointing out that many people born in surrounding areas have urban hukou.
- Parents are workers or public servants, family does not own land, so why call these areas '乡下'?
- Implies that defining areas as '乡下' based on non-administrative or stereotypical standards is unreasonable.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The author rejects non-administrative, stereotypical spatial definitions of '乡下' (such as rural vs. urban based on family land or occupation).
- Emphasizes hukou status (城镇户口) and parents' occupation in official sectors, implying administrative legitimacy as the proper standard.
- The author challenges vernacular spatial authority (RL1) and occupational typification (RL7) as invalid for defining '乡下.'
- Therefore, the author supports administrative boundary/hukou-based recognition logic for defining 'local' or 'urban' identity.

- Author describes being discriminated against as ""乡下人"" (country people) despite attending a university in Hangzhou.
- Attending school in Yuhang for 12 years was fine, no issues.
- Expresses that people from Yuhang are discriminated against by old core Hangzhou residents, called ""乡下人.""
- Old core Hangzhou residents consider their area small but significant, implying a territorial or identity boundary.
- Suggests a sense of exclusion or lack of belonging for those from Yuhang when considered by old core Hangzhou locals.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The author highlights the discrimination and identity boundary between old core Hangzhou residents and those from Yuhang.
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority (RL1) where locals distinguish insiders and outsiders based on shared perceptions of urban core versus peripheral areas.
- The emphasis on ""老底子杭州"" (old core Hangzhou) versus others implies a generational/local rootedness aspect (RL3).
- The use of ""乡下人"" as a derogatory label tied to place and perceived localness also connects to linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as it involves social identity and belonging.
- However, the strongest and clearest logic is vernacular spatial authority (RL1) due to spatial boundary and identity distinctions.
- The family rootedness (RL3) is implied by ""老底子杭州"" (old core Hangzhou) implying long-term local roots.
- The author does not emphasize administrative boundaries or functional livability, nor social embeddedness or occupation.

"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。

陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,Output: Recognition Logic 6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text
- 陈家祠 (a local clan hall or ancestral hall)
- 分红 (dividends or profit sharing)

Step 2: Match arguments for each named entity
- The phrase implies that if you receive dividends from the 陈家祠, it concerns you; if not, you are not involved.
- This suggests that having a share or stake in local communal resources (like clan dividends) is a criterion for belonging or being recognized as part of the local community.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic hidden behind each viewpoint expression
- The mention of dividends and shared community benefits reflects social embeddedness—having material or symbolic ties (such as community resources or clan benefits) as recognition of local identity.
- This aligns with the idea that local identity is linked to participation in community wealth or social networks.

- The author challenges or questions the idea that only rural Guangzhou people are considered locals, implying resistance to this narrow standard.
- The mention of supervisor as native and living near city area, but family has no dividends, suggests awareness of social embeddedness (dividends/property) as a local identity criterion.
- However, the author does not explicitly endorse or agree with any of these standards as defining ""local person"" identity.

"武汉13个区的GDP排名、未来发展、人口以及房价情况一直备受关注。外地人常认为汉口区是武汉最富有的区，实际上他们说的是江汉区。江汉路步行街、国广武广每日都在刷新武汉的最高消费记录，西北湖的金融圈也是高楼林立。不过，江汉区2024年GDP仅1627亿，在武汉排名第六，房价约15000到3万之间。
 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","Output: Recognition Logic 5, Recognition Logic 6","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text
