热烈欢迎咱叙北第一带盐人 北门可不差，论三环外，东西三环可不一定有北三环好，再等火北弄好，那就真起飞了,"RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 叙北第一带盐人 (a group or people in the northern part of X)
- 北门 (North Gate)
- 三环外 (Outside the Third Ring Road)
- 东西三环 (East and West Third Ring Road)
- 北三环 (North Third Ring Road)
- 火北 (Huobei area)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author welcomes the ""叙北第一带盐人,"" suggesting some recognition or pride in this group.
- The author says ""北门可不差,"" implying North Gate is not worse.
- The author compares ""三环外"" and ""东西三环"" to ""北三环,"" suggesting that East and West Third Ring Road may not be as good as North Third Ring Road.
- The author anticipates that once ""火北"" is improved, it will ""really take off.""

Step 3: Recognition Logic analysis:
- The author compares different spatial areas within the city (North Gate, outside the Third Ring Road, East and West Third Ring Road, North Third Ring Road, Huobei).
- The author implicitly endorses a spatial classification logic based on local intra-city areas and their relative desirability or status.
- This is not about administrative boundaries but about commonly recognized urban spatial divisions.
- The author shows a local emotional or cultural evaluation of these spatial areas.
- The author does not mention hukou or administrative legitimacy.
- No mention of family rootedness or linguistic-cultural markers.
- No mention of occupational groups or social embeddedness.
- The comparison focuses on spatial areas and their perceived quality or status, consistent with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) and possibly RL5 (Functional Livability) because of the implied quality improvement with ""火北弄好"" (once Huobei is fixed, it will take off), implying livability or development.

Step 4: Output:
The author uses RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) by referencing intra-city spatial categories and their status, and implicitly RL5 (Functional Livability) by anticipating improved livability or development of ""火北.""

Output: RL1, RL5"
真的很多，我就是周边的，不管现实还是网上看的很多，他们天天说自己土著然后说我们弯脚杆，碰到过一个成都gay来我们这弯酸我们这乡坝头，然后碰到过有人问我成都那里的，因为我以为是外地人所以说的成都这边的，我说都江堰的，他说二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川，刷到过很多帖子问成都要不要彩礼，然后成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的，抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的,"RL1, RL4","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 都江堰 (Dujiangyan)
- 四川 (Sichuan)
- 市中心 (city center)
- 周边 (surrounding areas)
- 二环 (Second Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- ""二环以内才是成都，二环以外是四川"": The author recounts that some people claim only areas inside the Second Ring Road count as Chengdu, outside is considered Sichuan, implying a spatial boundary for local identity.
- ""成都人就说我们土著市中心的不要，要的都是周边的"": There is a distinction made between ""native locals"" in the city center and those from surrounding areas, with locals in the center considered ""true locals"".
- ""抖音刷到周边的博主下面评论就一堆说人家口音的"": People comment on the accents of those from surrounding areas, implying linguistic-cultural differences.
- The author identifies themselves as ""周边的"" (from the surrounding area), indicating a spatial and possibly identity distinction.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The distinction based on ""二环以内"" (inside the Second Ring Road) and ""二环以外"" (outside) reflects a shared, habitual spatial classification beyond administrative boundaries, matching RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority.
- The mention of accent criticism (""口音"") in comments aligns with RL4 Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- The distinction between ""土著市中心"" and ""周边"" locals suggests a spatial and identity boundary, again supporting RL1.
- The author’s mention of ""我们土著"" and ""周边"" locals indicates these spatial and cultural distinctions define who counts as local.

Step 4: Output the results:
Output: RL1, RL4"
我是都江堰的，其他地方的我不敢说，但是我可是从小被成都口音嘲笑哦，我小时候去亲戚家耍过暑假，我说吃饭他们就笑我口音，现在去成都我都不敢开腔，有时候买东西都说普通话，经历过很多次被恶意学我说话,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 都江堰 (Dujiangyan)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author says they are from Dujiangyan.
- The author mentions being mocked for their Chengdu accent when speaking.
- The author feels hesitant to speak in Chengdu and often uses Mandarin to avoid being mocked.
- The author experienced being maliciously imitated for their way of speaking.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the importance of the local dialect/accent (成都口音) as a boundary or marker of local identity.
- The experience of being mocked or imitated for their accent suggests that speaking the local dialect is a recognized standard for defining who is a ""local person"" or insider.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 4: Output the results:

那我说都江堰话被笑的更多，我以前被介绍了个成都人，然后天天给我说他家以前二环以内的，说他家以前宽窄巷子的，各种装b，我就很厌恶,"RL1, RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 都江堰话 (Dujiangyan dialect), 成都人 (Chengdu person), 二环 (Second Ring Road), 宽窄巷子 (Kuanzhai Alley).

Step 2: The author mentions that speaking 都江堰话 (a local dialect) causes more ridicule, and that a person who claims to be a 成都人 (Chengdu person) boasts about living inside the Second Ring Road and near Kuanzhai Alley, which makes the author feel annoyed.

Step 3: The author implies that speaking the local dialect (or not) is a criterion for local identity, since being laughed at for speaking the Dujiangyan dialect is noted. Also, the boasting about living inside the Second Ring Road or near Kuanzhai Alley indicates the use of vernacular spatial boundaries as a status marker.

Step 4: The author implicitly endorses Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) and Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

那证明成都人的确不咋地，本来成都话口音离普通话语区就够偏了，很多怪音，他们还歧视本省的人，无语了都，儿化音就像大舌头一样，这是外地人评价的，为什么有些区县的来到成都要模仿他们的口音，本来就难听还要模仿是自己也不自信，大胆保持自己的地方本土特色有什么？,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都人 (Chengdu people)
- 成都话口音 (Chengdu dialect/accent)
- 本省的人 (people from the same province)
- 区县 (districts and counties)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author criticizes the Chengdu accent as deviating from standard Mandarin, describing it as having many strange sounds.
- The author notes that Chengdu people discriminate against people from the same province.
- The author mentions that some districts/counties' people who come to Chengdu imitate the Chengdu accent, which the author finds unpleasant and interprets as a lack of confidence in their own local characteristics.
- The author values maintaining one's local dialect or regional characteristics rather than imitating others.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The discussion focuses on dialect/accent as a criterion for local identity or acceptance. The author implies that speaking the local dialect (or not) is a marker of local identity and critiques the imitation of an accent as a sign of lacking confidence in local identity.
- This corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the author uses dialect/accent as a boundary marker for local identity and expresses a preference for maintaining one's own local linguistic-cultural traits.
- The author also mentions discrimination by locals against people from the same province, but this is descriptive and does not indicate endorsement of social embeddedness or occupational typification.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, vernacular spatial authority, or other logics is found.

我朋友都江堰人在成都十多年现在已经是成都口音了，我估计是她怕融入不了所以就变成那样了吧,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities: 都江堰, 成都  
Step 2: Viewpoint statements:  
- The friend is originally from 都江堰 but has lived in 成都 for over ten years and now speaks with a 成都 accent.  
- The author speculates that the friend changed her accent to fit in better, implying accent/dialect as a factor in local identity.  
Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:  
- The emphasis on changing accent to the local 成都 dialect as a way to be accepted or ""fit in"" indicates the author agrees with or recognizes dialect/accent as a standard for local identity.  
- This aligns with Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.  
Step 4: Output the result.

- 都江堰 (Dujiangyan)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states they are from Dujiangyan.
- They mention others say their accent is unpleasant.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author highlights the accent (口音) as a marker of identity, implying that speaking with a local accent is a feature related to ""local person"" identity.
- This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), which uses dialect or accent as a boundary marker for local identity.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author notes that the local people (""土著"") can immediately tell if someone is not from Chengdu (specifically from inside the First Ring Road) by their accent.
- The author implies that the accent difference is a marker of local identity.
- The author mentions that locals are very warm and helpful to outsiders.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses the criterion of accent (""口音明显"") to distinguish locals from non-locals.
- This aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as the dialect/accent is used as a boundary marker to identify locals.
- The mention of ""一环内的"" (within the First Ring Road) may hint at spatial boundaries, but the emphasis is on the accent as the identity marker.
- The warmth towards outsiders is a social attitude but does not define local identity, so it is not annotated.

- 内江 (Neijiang)
- 自贡 (Zigong)
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 一环 (First Ring Road, referring to a central area in Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author is from Neijiang, near Zigong.
- The author speaks with a pure Zigong accent.
- The author has lived in Chengdu for more than ten years and bought a house inside the first ring road.
- The author emphasizes that speaking (language) is for communication, and understanding is what matters, not where one comes from.
- The author does not worry about their accent or others' opinions about it.
- The author criticizes those who judge based on accent as shallow and not worth engaging with.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses the accent (dialect) as an indicator related to identity but explicitly downplays its importance and rejects anxiety about it.
- The author states ""where you come from is not important,"" indicating rejection of place-based identity logic.
- The author emphasizes personal ability (""自己有本事才是最重要的"") rather than birthplace or dialect as the true standard.
- The author recognizes the existence of dialect differences but does not endorse using dialect as a criterion for local identity.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy or family rootedness.
- The author has lived in Chengdu for over ten years and owns a house inside the first ring, but does not explicitly say this is a standard for local identity.
- The author focuses on the communication function of language, not on linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion.
- The author rejects the social judgment based on accent.

Conclusion:
- The author discusses dialect but rejects RL4 as a standard.
- The author does not mention or endorse RL1 (vernacular spatial authority), RL2 (administrative legitimacy), RL3 (family rootedness), RL5 (functional livability), RL6 (social embeddedness), or RL7 (occupational typification) as standards.
- The author only implicitly recognizes dialect exists but explicitly denies it as a valid standard for defining local identity.
- The author values personal ability over origin or accent, which is not a recognition logic in RL1-RL7.

我不内耗我也不觉得我们口音不好听，我只是觉得有些成都人笑别人很无语,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都人 (Chengdu people)

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The author states they do not think their accent sounds bad.
- The author mentions some Chengdu people laugh at others (presumably for their accents).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author talks about accent (口音), implying a linguistic-cultural recognition standard.
- The author does not explicitly say accent defines who is local, but by discussing accent and people's attitudes towards it, the author implicitly acknowledges that accent is a criterion used in defining local identity or distinguishing locals from non-locals.

Step 4: Output the result:
Output: RL4"
你上面就有一条，说我们口音很贱,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific.

Step 2: The author refers to a statement ""说我们口音很贱"" (saying our accent is very bad). The author mentions this but does not explicitly endorse or oppose this as a standard for defining local identity.

Step 3: The mention of ""口音"" (accent) relates to linguistic-cultural recognition, RL4. Although the author does not explicitly state agreement, the reference to accent as a point of judgment implies recognition of accent as a local identity marker.

Step 4: Output all recognition logic categories that the author implicitly or explicitly uses to define ""local person"" identity.

Output: RL4"
哈哈，就是，而且我有个同事达州的，他说他的口音才是正宗成都话,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 达州 (Dazhou)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions a colleague from Dazhou who claims that his accent is the authentic Chengdu accent.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The discussion focuses on accent as a criterion for authenticity or legitimacy of being a ""local person"" from Chengdu.
- The colleague's claim about the ""correct"" Chengdu accent implies using linguistic features to define who is a genuine local.
- This fits RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific.

Step 2: The text ""哈哈哈哈，口音很贱，这个"" (Haha, the accent is very annoying) expresses a negative attitude towards someone's accent.

Step 3: The author comments on accent, which relates to linguistic-cultural markers. The author implicitly uses accent as a standard to judge or identify someone, indicating a recognition logic related to dialect or accent.

Step 4: The author's core argument is that accent is a marker of identity, implicitly endorsing Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Output: RL4"
重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小，重要是带不带口音口音改不到撒,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 房子 (houses)
- 口音 (accent)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says ""重要的不是几套房子 房子在哪，是不是老破小"" (The important thing is not how many houses one has or where the houses are, or whether the houses are old and broken).
- The author emphasizes ""重要是带不带口音 口音改不到撒"" (What is important is whether one has an accent or not; accent cannot be changed).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly denies that the number or location/quality of houses is important for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The author emphasizes accent (口音) as the important criterion that cannot be changed.
- This corresponds to RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, because accent is a linguistic boundary marker used to define local identity.
- The mention of houses is explicitly rejected as a criterion, so RL6 (social embeddedness related to property) is not endorsed here.

Step 4: Output the results:
Output: RL4"
还有外地人骂成都口音难听呢，逼着他来成都了？,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 成都: The author mentions that outsiders criticize the Chengdu accent as unpleasant, implying that speaking the local dialect is a notable aspect of local identity.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic: The mention of accent criticism suggests that the author is highlighting linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion for defining who is local.

Output: RL3, RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 爸爸 (father, from Chengdu)
- 爷爷奶奶 (grandparents, lived in Chengdu)
- 妈妈 (mother, from another city)
- 妈妈的城市 (mother's city, different from Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author questions whether they count as a Chengdu local.
- Father's family (father, grandparents) are Chengdu locals.
- The author has hukou (户口) in Chengdu.
- Mother is from another city; parents work there.
- The author grew up in the mother's city, not Chengdu.
- When visiting Chengdu as a child, the author was called ""乡巴佬"" (country bumpkin) by local children.
- The author did not feel a sense of belonging to Chengdu.
- The author cannot speak Chengdu dialect fluently, only understands it.
- The author speaks Sichuan dialect but with an accent, and colleagues comment on it.
- The author has a weak local identity with Chengdu.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:

- The author mentions ""户口在成都"" (hukou in Chengdu) as a fact but does not explicitly say this makes them a local or that hukou defines local identity. The statement is neutral and no explicit endorsement of hukou as a defining standard is made. So RL2 is not clearly endorsed.

- The author emphasizes family roots: father is from Chengdu, grandparents lived there, which implies family rootedness as a factor in defining local identity. The author contrasts this with their own upbringing in another city and the resulting weak identity. This is an explicit recognition of family rootedness affecting local identity. So RL3 is endorsed.

- The author discusses language: cannot speak Chengdu dialect well, colleagues say their Sichuan dialect has an accent, and this affects their local identity recognition. This suggests linguistic-cultural recognition is a standard used to judge local identity. So RL4 is endorsed.

- The author mentions being called ""乡巴佬"" by local children when visiting Chengdu, which is a social label tied to perceived local status but not clearly mapped to occupational typification or social embeddedness. This is more about linguistic-cultural or social recognition.

- No mention of vernacular spatial authority (RL1), administrative legitimacy (RL2, only mentioned but not endorsed), functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness via property or social networks (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).

Step 4: Output results:

Output: RL3, RL4"
一个口音，一个面，我们天天被网暴，门都不敢出,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- None explicitly named; the text mentions ""a certain accent"" and ""a certain face"" but without specifying location or group names.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author mentions ""一个口音"" (an accent) and ""一个面"" (a face), and that they are ""天天被网暴"" (daily cyberbullied), ""门都不敢出"" (don't dare to go out).
- The mention of ""口音"" (accent) suggests that accent is a factor causing the author to be targeted.
- The ""face"" likely refers to physical appearance or possibly regional facial features.
- The author implies that these features cause them to be excluded or attacked, indicating these features are standards used by others to judge identity.
- However, the author is describing the experience of being cyberbullied due to accent and face, which suggests these are standards others use to judge them, not necessarily standards the author endorses to define ""local person.""

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- Accent is a typical feature of RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author mentions accent as a basis for attack.
- The author does not explicitly endorse this as a standard for defining ""local person,"" but the mention suggests the social reality that accent is a recognized identity marker.
- The author is negatively affected by this, which may imply resistance to this standard, but the task says to annotate if the author implicitly agrees or endorses.
- The mention of ""一个面"" (a face) could relate to physical appearance as a local identity marker, but there is no explicit cultural or other recognition logic described.
- The author says ""we are cyberbullied every day,"" indicating they are victims, so they likely do not endorse this as a positive standard.
- Therefore, RL4 is mentioned but likely as a resisted standard, not endorsed.
- No other RL categories are suggested.

Step 4: Output the results:
- Since the author does not explicitly or implicitly endorse the accent or face as a legitimate standard for defining ""local person,"" but rather reports being attacked for it, **no RL category should be annotated**.

Step 2: The author comments on the annoying phone calls mostly coming from people with non-local accents. The author clarifies this is not discrimination but implies that these people are not locals because of their accent.

Step 3: The author uses accent (""外地口音"") as a basis to distinguish locals from non-locals, implying that speaking the local dialect or accent is a criterion for ""local person"" identity. The mention of ""外地口音"" and distinguishing them from locals corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Step 4: Output the recognized logic.

之前在成都上学遇到两个女的 就不是成都人 四川其他地方的 非要说自己是成都人 只是亲戚在双流买了房子而已各种也装的要死 我真的想问这有什么好优越的吗自己的土生土长的地方都不承认,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 四川其他地方 (other parts of Sichuan)
- 双流 (Shuangliu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 成都: The author implies that being a ""real"" Chengdu person means being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally).
- 四川其他地方: The two women come from other parts of Sichuan but claim to be Chengdu people just because their relatives bought a house in Shuangliu.
- 双流: The women’s relatives have bought a house here, but the author does not accept that as a legitimate reason to claim Chengdu local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes ""土生土长"" (native born and raised) as a legitimate criterion for being a real Chengdu person.
- The author rejects the claim of local identity based on owning property or relatives owning property in the area (i.e., the author does not accept RL6 as a legitimate standard).
- The author criticizes the women's false claim to local identity based on property ownership but supports family rootedness as the real criterion.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic:
- The author endorses RL3 (Family Rootedness) as the standard for defining a local person.
- The author does not endorse RL6 (Social Embeddedness), only mentions it as a false claim.

Output: RL3"

Output: RL6","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 农村老板 (rural boss)
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 其他同事 (other colleagues)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 农村老板 bought a house in Chengdu and claims to be a local person now.
- He brags about his entrepreneurial success.
- He does not claim to have a Chengdu hukou (household registration) in front of other colleagues because they are not ""土著"" (native locals).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The boss claims to be a local person because he bought a house in Chengdu, implying that property ownership is used as a criterion for local identity. This matches RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- He does not claim to have a Chengdu hukou, implying that hukou is a different standard, but the text does not indicate that the author endorses hukou as a standard themselves.
- The term ""土著"" (native) is used by the boss to distinguish others who lack this status, but no explicit author endorsement of family roots or dialect is made.
- No mention of dialect, spatial boundaries, or other standards.

Step 2: The author discusses how the expansion of Chengdu (成都) has led to areas far within the 2nd and 3rd ring roads being called Chengdu, but the older generation (the author's parents' generation) finds it hard to distinguish these areas as ""local"" or truly part of Chengdu. They prefer the original place names. The author implies that the older generation's habit of defining ""local"" is based on traditional, familiar spatial categories rather than the expanded administrative boundaries.

Step 3: Recognition Logic Analysis:
- The author emphasizes the older generation's difficulty in accepting the expanded city boundaries as ""local,"" preferring traditional spatial divisions (original place names).
- This reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): the author implicitly agrees that local identity is tied to habitual, historically sedimented perceptions of spatial boundaries rather than administrative expansions.
- The mention of older generations' habit and difficulty suggests a cultural, emotional map of local identity tied to specific spatial areas.

Step 4: Output the result.

并没有啊，成都有钱的又不一定是土著，绝大部分土著只是不愁房子住，另外有多余的房子可以出租出去，所以工资那么低很多人还是过得很开心月收入足够支撑不错的生活水平了。成都人天生一副你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕各过各的谁也不碍着谁所以大家才悠然自得，那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的，多是外地赚了钱来成都消费或者安置的,Output: RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 有钱的区域 (wealthy areas)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author says: ""成都有钱的又不一定是土著"" (wealthy people in Chengdu are not necessarily locals).
- ""绝大部分土著只是不愁房子住，另外有多余的房子可以出租出去"" (most locals just don't worry about housing and have extra houses to rent).
- ""工资那么低很多人还是过得很开心"" (many locals live happily on low wages).
- ""成都人天生一副你有钱那是你的事，我不去羡慕各过各的谁也不碍着谁"" (Chengdu people have an attitude of minding their own business regardless of wealth).
- ""那些个有钱的区域又不属于是给土著的，多是外地赚了钱来成都消费或者安置的"" (those wealthy areas are not for locals, but mostly for outsiders who made money elsewhere).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes ""locals"" (土著) from wealthy outsiders.
- The standard used to define ""local person"" is not wealth or property, as the author points out wealthy areas are mostly non-locals.
- The author uses ""土著"" as a group defined by historical or generational roots (implied by ""绝大部分土著只是不愁房子住"" and the contrast with outsiders).
- The author implies a social embeddedness aspect: locals own houses and rent them out; outsiders consume or settle in wealthy areas.
- The text also implies social embeddedness (RL6) as a standard, since locals have property ownership and community embeddedness, while wealthy areas are for outsiders.
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, dialect, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.
- No direct mention of family rootedness (RL3) but implied by ""土著"" and contrasts with outsiders.
- The author explicitly denies wealth/property as a defining factor for being a local, so RL6 is only partially relevant if it is about ownership as a social embeddedness marker of local identity.

Given the author emphasizes property ownership and social embeddedness as markers of locals, but denies wealth as a criterion, RL6 is still relevant as the author uses property ownership as a local identity marker.

Step 4: Output results

我崇州的嘛 我们身边的人被问到是哪里的 都直接说崇州 不会说是成都的从小到大耳濡目染的就是成都人都觉得三环以外的不算成都的,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 崇州 (Chongzhou), 成都 (Chengdu), 三环 (Third Ring Road)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- People from 崇州 say they are from 崇州, not 成都.
- From childhood, the author has absorbed that people in 成都 think areas outside the Third Ring Road are not considered 成都.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The statement about 成都 people considering areas outside the Third Ring Road as not really 成都 reflects a shared local perception of spatial boundaries that define local identity, which corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The emphasis on ""from childhood hearing"" indicates the sedimented local cognitive map.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or hukou.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

话说什么是土著，我认为从爷爷辈土生土长开始才算是土著，那些从外地拿到成都户口或者父母辈从外地来定居生下的娃娃，然后很骄傲的弯酸，这种不算，并且所谓的成都人假打90%以上都是这种人,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""土著"" (local person), ""成都"" (Chengdu), ""外地"" (other places)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- For ""土著"": The author believes that only those born and raised locally since the grandfather's generation count as 土著 (local person).
- Those who got Chengdu hukou from outside places or whose parents came from outside and had children here are not considered 土著.
- The author explicitly excludes these groups from being local.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses the criterion of family rootedness, emphasizing ""from grandfather's generation born and raised locally"" to define local identity.
- This matches Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness (Family Historical Roots / Individual Growth History).

Step 4: Output result.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author claims to be a ""土生土长成都女娃儿"" (born and raised in Chengdu), emphasizing no accent difference.
- The author feels a sense of intimacy (""多亲切"") when returning.
- ""被烧的时候一点感觉都没有"" indicates a personal experience, but no direct link to defining local identity.
- ""一点口音都没有"" highlights absence of accent difference.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses family rootedness and individual growth history to define local identity (""土生土长"" = born and raised locally), matching RL3.
- The mention of ""一点口音都没有"" implies linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion for local identity, matching RL4.
- No administrative, social embeddedness, or other logics are explicitly or implicitly endorsed here.

反正我三环外的不是成都人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 三环外 (Outside the Third Ring Road)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that people living outside the Third Ring Road are not considered Chengdu locals.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses a spatial boundary (the Third Ring Road) as a criterion to define who is a local person.
- This is an example of Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1), where local identity is defined by habitual or collective perceptions of spatial boundaries within the city, rather than official administrative borders.

Step 4: Output the results:
Output: RL1"
我同学说二环外的都是农民,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities: 二环外 (Outside the Second Ring Road)

Step 2: The author mentions that their classmate says ""二环外的都是农民"" (Outside the Second Ring Road are all farmers). The author is relaying this statement but does not explicitly endorse or reject it. However, this statement associates a certain spatial area (二环外) with a social group (农民).

Step 3: The statement links a spatial area with a social group (farmers), which corresponds to Recognition Logic 7 (Occupational Typification). However, the author does not explicitly endorse this view themselves; it is their classmate's opinion.

The instruction says only annotate if the author themself endorses or implicitly agrees with the standard. Here, the author just repeats the classmate's view without explicit agreement or implicit endorsement.

Therefore, no annotation.

Output:"

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author mentions ""歧视三环外的多"" (more discrimination against people outside the Third Ring Road) and ""学生偏多"" (more students there).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author mentions discrimination against people outside the Third Ring Road, implying a boundary of local identity related to spatial location.
- The mention of ""outside the Third Ring Road"" as a distinct area suggests a vernacular spatial authority logic.
- The mention of students being more numerous is a demographic observation but does not directly relate to defining local person identity.
- No explicit administrative, family rootedness, linguistic, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification logic is expressed or endorsed.

Step 4: Output the result:

成都土著的优越感是最强的，没有之一那种。比如他们在强调自己血统纯正的时候，往往会在前面加上土著或土生土长这样的词语。外地的不用说了，还没资格让土生土长的5城区成都人看不起，有资格被看不起的，首先你要是三环外但是大成都的弯脚杆和211，或者是后面来但是获得了成都省护照的新成都。,"RL1, RL2, RL3","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 成都 (Chengdu)  
- 5城区 (five urban districts)  
- 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road)  
- 大成都 (Greater Chengdu)  
- 弯脚杆 (a colloquial term likely referring to a certain group)  
- 211 (likely referring to 211 universities, a group of prestigious Chinese universities)  
- 成都省护照 (Chengdu provincial passport, possibly a metaphor for a certain recognized local status)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 成都土著强调血统纯正，喜欢用“土著”或“土生土长”来标榜自己。  
- 外地人没有资格被土生土长的5城区成都人看得起。  
- 被看得起的外地人，需满足条件：三环外但属于大成都的弯脚杆和211，或者是后来获得成都省护照的新成都人。

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- “血统纯正”，“土生土长”明显强调家族根基和成长经历，是RL3的典型特征。  
- “5城区成都人”与“三环外大成都”区别，涉及对城市范围的认知和地域划分，带有明显的RL1（方言空间权威）特征。  
- “弯脚杆和211”，“获得成都省护照的新成都”暗示通过教育背景和某种官方身份认同，但重点是强调身份和资格，符合RL2（行政合法性）和RL3（家族或成长历史）成分，但文本中“成都省护照”更像是一种行政或官方身份标识。  
- 但文本整体更突出的是以“土著”“土生土长”血统和城市核心区域（5城区）作为身份认同标准，反映RL3和RL1。

- 成华区  
- 二环内

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions ""成华区二环内土著"" (native/local people inside the Second Ring Road of Chenghua District) and implies a long-term presence (""几十年了""), expressing no particular feeling or issue (""没觉得啥子""). This implies that being a native or local is linked to long-term residence in a specific spatial area (inside the Second Ring Road in Chenghua District).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The emphasis on ""几十年了"" (decades) suggests a recognition logic based on **long-term residence and family roots**, which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The specific spatial reference to ""二环内"" and ""成华区"" indicates the author uses intra-city spatial boundaries to define local identity, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions ""三环外的弯脚杆"" (outside the Third Ring Road's Wanjiaogan) in a dismissive or questioning tone regarding its status or respect.
- Implicitly, the author suggests that areas outside the Third Ring Road are considered less local or less respected, indicating a spatial boundary in the perception of who or what is ""local.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) reflects a spatial boundary used to define local identity.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author refers to a common local perception of spatial boundaries that influence local identity.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""三环内土著不歧视外地人"" — locals within the Third Ring do not discriminate against outsiders.
- ""但歧视三环外人"" — but discriminate against people outside the Third Ring.
- The author mentions that a local originally from the city center moved to Tianfu New Area.
- Implicitly, the author acknowledges a distinction between people inside and outside the Third Ring as a marker of local identity and social distinction.

Step 3: Recognition Logic analysis:
- The division between ""三环内"" and ""三环外"" is a common vernacular spatial boundary in many Chinese cities, often used to define who is considered truly ""local.""
- The author describes locals inside the Third Ring as distinct from those outside, implying a spatial boundary that affects identity and social treatment.
- This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author is using the common perception of the Third Ring boundary to define local identity.

No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), dialect/culture (RL4), functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).

- The colleague's husband lives in the Second Ring Road area and owns a house there.
- However, his hukou (household registration) is in Qingbaijiang.
- His relatives mockingly refer to them as ""乡坝头,"" implying a derogatory or outsider status.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""户口是青白江的"" (hukou is in Qingbaijiang) as a point of distinction implies the author (or the colleague) acknowledges administrative registration (hukou) as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity. This corresponds to RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.
- The relatives’ use of ""乡坝头"" as a mocking term reflects a vernacular spatial classification and social labeling based on local perceptions and stereotypes, which relates to RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.

- At the edge of the Third Ring Road, the author ""does not dare to say they are a native"" (土著).
- When going into the First and Second Ring Road areas, people say ""entered the city,"" implying a difference between these areas.
- The author is afraid to drive because of fear of being criticized.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies that areas inside the First and Second Ring Road are considered the ""real city"" or ""core local area,"" while the edge of the Third Ring Road is not fully considered ""local.""
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1) because the author is using common local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories to define who counts as a ""local person.""
- There is no mention of administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation in this context.

- Also mentions that people outside this area may be discriminated against by outsiders.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The statement about ""三环外不配"" suggests a spatial boundary for defining who counts as local or not, based on habitual local perceptions rather than administrative boundaries. This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of discrimination by outsiders indicates social dynamics but does not directly define local identity by social embeddedness or other logics.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as the basis for local identity.

- The author perceives that some friends from other parts of Sichuan suspect them of having a sense of superiority.
- The author notes that Chengdu friends speaking the Chengdu dialect outside are sometimes accused of faking the accent.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes dialect (""说个成都话"") as a marker of local identity and notes the social policing around speaking the local dialect, which aligns with linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The author self-identifies as a native from a specific spatial area (First Ring Road), which suggests an intra-city spatial categorization (vernacular spatial authority).
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards.
- The suspicion from others about ""优越感"" is about social perception but not a criterion the author endorses for local identity.

- The author mentions that most Chengdu locals are good people and recalls that many Chengdu women used to introduce dates to them.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly states that being a local (""成都土著"") is not very relevant; rather, ""personal quality"" is the standard.
- The author does not endorse any standard related to administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, spatial boundaries, social embeddedness, livability, or occupation to define local identity.
- The author does not clearly endorse or imply any of the RL categories for defining ""local person"".
- The mention of ""成都土著"" is more descriptive and does not specify standards for defining local identity.

- The author says they are from 成都郊区 (Chengdu suburbs), but others say they are 成都人 (Chengdu people).
- The author feels others' response is somewhat sarcastic or condescending.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author identifies themselves as from the suburbs, implying a distinction between ""郊区人"" and ""成都人"".
- Others' labeling as ""成都人"" implies a broader urban identity.
- The author is highlighting a social distinction based on spatial identity between suburbs and urban core.
- This reflects RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority: the author recognizes a local spatial classification (郊区 vs. city proper) that others may overlook or mock.
- The text mentions family residence (""跟父母常年住在成都的"") but does not emphasize generational roots or growth history as a standard to define local identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, social embeddedness, occupation, or livability standards.

- 成都人: described as kind and not discriminatory against outsiders.
- 外地人: described as discriminatory and excluding towards Chengdu people.
- 二环 and 春熙路: the author mentions ""我二环的，我们去春熙路一般都说进城"" (""I live in the Second Ring Road, when we go to Chunxi Road we usually say we are going 'into the city'"").

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The discussion about discrimination based on family wealth (number of houses, ability to pay dowry) is more about social status and wealth, but the author is criticizing the external stereotype or discrimination rather than endorsing wealth/property as a criterion for being local.
- The author identifies as living in the Second Ring Road and mentions going to Chunxi Road is ""going into the city,"" which implies a vernacular spatial perception of city boundaries and local area status, reflecting a shared local perception of intra-city spatial hierarchy.
- The phrase ""我们去春熙路一般都说进城"" indicates the author endorses or at least assumes the local spatial logic about city center boundaries (RL1).
- There is no direct mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, or occupational typification.
- The wealth/property discussion is described as an external stereotype; the author does not endorse wealth or property as a criterion for local identity, but rather rejects that logic.
- The author emphasizes social harmony and kindness of Chengdu locals but does not link linguistic-cultural recognition or social embeddedness explicitly.

- 老成都人 (old Chengdu locals)  
- 成都 (Chengdu)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 老成都人 are being insulted or looked down upon by others.  
- The author mentions that many old Chengdu locals are from ordinary families and questions why their origin matters.  
- The author states that the supposed ""tolerance"" or ""inclusiveness"" of Chengdu is often explained as ""not caring about others' affairs.""  
- The author suggests that lack of strong belonging or integration into the local community is not the fault of non-locals.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author is defending old Chengdu locals, emphasizing ordinary family backgrounds and questioning the importance of origin. This suggests a resistance to judging local identity by family roots or origins.  
- The mention of ""归属感不强不融入当地不是本地人的错"" (lack of belonging or integration is not the fault of non-locals) implies the author disagrees with defining locals based on social embeddedness or integration.  
- The author mentions ""老成都人"" (old Chengdu locals) as a category, which implicitly relates to family rootedness or historical belonging, but the author seems to lament the negative treatment rather than explicitly endorsing this as a standard.  
- The text does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy, dialect, livability, occupational typification, or spatial authority as standards for local identity.  

Step 4: Conclusion  
- The author does not explicitly endorse any standard to define ""local person.""  
- The author points out that ""old Chengdu locals"" exist, which could imply RL3 (Family Rootedness), but the author’s main argument is about being looked down upon rather than defining local identity by that standard.  
- The author denies that lack of belonging or integration (RL6) should disqualify someone from being local.  
- No explicit or implicit positive endorsement of any RL category is found.

Step 2: Match arguments:  
- The author states that ""弯脚杆"" provoke by insulting the hometown (Chengdu), saying the noodles are the worst, the inner city area is broken down, the accent is unpleasant, and people are fake.  
- The author claims that real Chengdu people are the ones who are discriminated against by outsiders.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The insults about ""成都二环内市区破烂"" and ""口音难听"" relate to the spatial scope and dialect, respectively.  
- The author implicitly defends the identity of Chengdu locals by emphasizing the accent (""口音难听""), which relates to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).  
- The mention of ""成都二环内市区破烂"" as a characteristic of the core city area implies an understanding of spatial categories of the city and local identity, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The author is defending the ""real Chengdu people"" identity against outsiders, implying that being a ""real local"" involves belonging to the recognized core area and speaking the local dialect.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that they themselves would not call themselves a Chengdu person if they live outside the Third Ring Road, unless explaining to outsiders.
- The author implies that ""Chengdu native"" generally refers to the central urban area.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses spatial boundary perception (inside or outside the Third Ring Road) to define ""local person"" identity.
- This corresponds to RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author uses habitual local perceptions of city spatial divisions to define local identity.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- 成都人: generally not exclusionary or discriminatory.  
- 三环外: people outside the Third Ring Road are called ""弯脚杆"" (a nickname) due to their accent differences. This is a traditional saying passed down from the older generation.  
- 老一辈: passed down this nickname and associated with the accent difference.  
- 年轻人: less likely to use this nickname or discriminate.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The key point is that the ""local person"" identity or distinction is partly defined by accent differences linked to areas inside/outside the Third Ring Road. The author states that people outside the Third Ring Road have a different accent (""变口音了""), and this is used as a marker by locals (especially older generation) to distinguish insiders vs outsiders, albeit mostly in a joking manner without malice.  
- This reflects RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): the accent or dialect difference is a boundary marker used to distinguish locals vs non-locals or insiders vs outsiders.  
- Also, the spatial boundary ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) is used to categorize people, which corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author references a habitual local perception of intra-city spatial categories (inside vs outside the Third Ring Road) and the symbolic meaning of this boundary in defining local identity.

- The author mentions their local relatives look down on outsiders.
- The relatives believe that people living outside the Third Ring Road are ""not acceptable.""
- The boyfriend is described as ""农转非"" by the relatives.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The relatives use spatial boundaries (三环外) as a criterion to judge who is considered a local or acceptable local person. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""农转非"" (agricultural to non-agricultural hukou) is an administrative classification related to hukou status, used to judge identity. This aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author states ""我土著我倒是还好"" indicating self-identification as a native/local, which could imply RL3 (Family Rootedness), but this is not explicitly argued or elaborated in this text, so cannot be confirmed.

- This is a spatial classification based on commonly understood urban spatial divisions rather than administrative boundaries.
- This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 4: Output the results

Output: RL1"
以前主要是大邑口音真的重，现在还好了吧现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities: 大邑 (Dayi), 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- ""以前主要是大邑口音真的重"" (""Previously, the Dayi accent was really strong"") — this discusses the accent of Dayi people.
- ""现在还好了吧"" (""Now it's better"") — implies the accent issue has lessened.
- ""现在在成都的外地人特别歧视成都土著"" (""Now outsiders in Chengdu especially discriminate against Chengdu natives"") — describes social dynamics but does not explicitly state a standard for defining who is local.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""大邑口音"" (Dayi accent) relates to dialect/accent as a marker of local identity.
- The author implicitly acknowledges that accent (linguistic features) is a standard by which local identity is recognized or distinguished.
- The statement about discrimination is descriptive and does not establish a recognition logic for defining ""local person.""

Step 4: Output the RL label(s) corresponding to linguistic-cultural recognition.

我爷爷老家是大邑县那边的，但是现在我爷爷的全家亲戚都已经全部搬到成都来了，并且有可能是我们沟通交流确实比较少，我印象当中他们没有过说可能要回到祖籍地去探望一下之类的。然后到我爸爸这一代就已经开始说自己就是土生土长成都人了。,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 大邑县
- 成都

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions that their grandfather's ancestral home is 大邑县, but the entire family has moved to 成都.
- The author notes that by their father's generation, people started to say they are ""土生土长成都人"" (born and raised in Chengdu).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""土生土长"" (born and raised) as the criterion for being a local person indicates a focus on family rootedness and individual growth history.
- The mention of ancestral home but the shift to identifying as ""born and raised"" in Chengdu indicates the author endorses the standard of local identity based on family roots and generational settlement.

Step 4: Output:
Output: RL3"
思想观念，口音，穿着品味,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific, but concepts mentioned are ""思想观念"" (ideology/concept), ""口音"" (accent), and ""穿着品味"" (dressing taste).

Step 2: Match arguments to entities: The author mentions ""思想观念"" (ideology), ""口音"" (accent), and ""穿着品味"" (dressing taste) as standards.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- ""口音"" (accent) corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), as accent/dialect is a key marker.

- ""思想观念"" (ideology/concept) and ""穿着品味"" (dressing taste) relate to cultural or social markers but are not clearly defined in RL. ""思想观念"" could be interpreted as part of cultural recognition, but RL4 mainly focuses on dialect/accent and cultural habits. Since ""穿着品味"" (dressing taste) is about personal style, it does not directly fit RL4 or other categories unless explicitly linked to local cultural recognition.

Given the task's focus, ""思想观念"" and ""穿着品味"" are not explicitly covered by any RL category; they are more personal/social preferences rather than recognized standards for defining ""local person.""

Step 4: Output the recognized RL category labels.

Output: RL4"
……如果北京上海土著来到成都也是外地人，是不是也歧视人家思想意识 口音 和穿着品味,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- Beijing
- Shanghai
- Chengdu

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author mentions that even native people from Beijing or Shanghai coming to Chengdu are considered outsiders.
- The author questions whether it is discriminatory to judge them based on their ideology, accent, and dress taste.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author is discussing how ""local person"" identity is recognized.
- The mention of ""思想意识"" (ideology/thought), ""口音"" (accent), and ""穿着品味"" (dress taste) as criteria that could be used to discriminate indicates that these cultural or linguistic features are relevant in defining local identity.
- The focus on accent and cultural traits aligns with RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The mention of ""思想意识"" (thoughts, ideology) and ""穿着品味"" (dress taste) can be associated with cultural recognition, but primarily the accent is a clear RL4 indicator.
- The author seems to question the fairness of such discrimination, but since the question implies these are standards used to distinguish locals from outsiders, and the author implicitly acknowledges their existence, RL4 is applicable.
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, spatial boundaries, or social embeddedness is made.
- The author does not express agreement or endorsement with these standards but raises the question of discrimination, implying awareness of these standards as used by others.
- Since the author questions the discrimination based on these cultural markers, they implicitly recognize that such markers are used as standards.
- Therefore, RL4 applies.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL4"
哈哈哈点了，大大方方承认不好吗，还要拿什么思想观念口音穿着品味当遮羞布，都21世纪了，不会真有人觉得只有城里人思想前卫穿着讲究品味高档吗至于口音，更加扯淡不是吗,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specifically named, but general references to ""city people"" (城里人) and standards like ""thoughts,"" ""accent,"" ""clothing,"" ""taste.""

Step 2: The author is criticizing the use of ""thoughts,"" ""accent,"" ""clothing,"" ""taste"" as standards to define or distinguish ""local people"" or ""city people."" The author suggests these are excuses (""遮羞布"") and finds it unreasonable to think that only city people have advanced thoughts, refined clothing, or high taste. The mention of ""accent"" is also dismissed as nonsense.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author is addressing the standards of ""thoughts (ideology),"" ""accent,"" ""clothing,"" and ""taste"" as identity markers.
- The author explicitly rejects using these as criteria to define ""local person"" or ""city person.""
- Therefore, RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), which includes accent as a boundary marker, is being negated by the author.
- The author also rejects ""thoughts,"" ""clothing,"" ""taste"" as identity markers, but these do not directly map to any RL categories defined in the manual.
- Since the author rejects RL4 and does not endorse any other RL, no RL categories should be annotated.

Step 4: Output result: No RL categories.

Step 2: The author compares the ""鄙视链"" (contempt hierarchy) in Chengdu and Beijing, noting Chengdu's is even more severe, especially compared to Beijing's Second Ring Road area.

Step 3: The author mentions ""京二环"" (Beijing Second Ring Road) as a spatial boundary associated with social hierarchies or contempt chains. This implies a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1) where intra-city spatial categories carry symbolic or social meaning.

Step 4: The author does not explicitly discuss administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author identifies themselves as a ""native"" within the inner second ring road of Chengdu.
- They state they have no sense of superiority and have few friends, mostly non-locals, and do not feel any particular way.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author explicitly uses the spatial boundary ""成都二环内"" (inside the Second Ring Road) to define their identity as a local native.
- This is a vernacular spatial boundary, not an administrative boundary.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The core logic is that being inside the Second Ring Road is considered ""local,"" indicating RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 2: The author states that in their childhood there was no concept of ""Chengdu local/native,"" and they do not know who defined this concept in the past ten years.

Step 3: The author is discussing the concept of ""local person"" identity but does not express agreement or endorsement of any particular recognition logic or standard. Instead, the author is questioning the origin of the concept itself.

Step 4: Since the author neither endorses nor implicitly agrees with any standard for defining ""local person,"" no RL categories apply.

- 长顺街 (Changshun Street)
- 周边的城乡结合部 (surrounding urban-rural fringe areas)
- 农村 (countryside)
- 锦小时 (likely a school)
- 军区后勤 (military logistics)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 长顺街: The author identifies as 土著 (local/native) from 长顺街.
- 周边的城乡结合部: The author envies these areas for dividends, demolition compensation, and land.
- 农村: The author envies people from the countryside for the ability to return home during New Year, set off fireworks, slaughter pigs, and live in a naturally pollution-free environment.
- 锦小时: The author recalls many classmates whose families were military logistics personnel, who had various privileges.
- Overall, the author expresses no sense of superiority about being 土著 but misses the old neighbors from specific local streets.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author refers to 土著 identity linked to having historical ties to 长顺街 and surrounding areas, implying a family or growth-rootedness to the place. This matches RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The envy of dividends, demolition, and land from urban-rural fringe areas suggests recognition of social embeddedness tied to economic resources and property, matching RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The envy of countryside people for their natural environment and cultural practices during New Year hints at cultural and lifestyle recognition but is more about lifestyle preference than defining local identity; no explicit dialect or cultural boundary markers are used to define ""local person"" identity here, so RL4 is weak.
- The mention of military logistics families with privileges suggests occupational typification linked to social status and identity, matching RL7 (Occupational Typification).
- The author expresses nostalgia for old neighborhoods, which could relate to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) as it involves shared spatial identity and emotional attachment to specific local areas.

Step 2: Match arguments to named entities:
- The author states their home is in the urban-rural fringe outside the Third Ring Road.
- The author mentions that the area has everything nearby but they generally do not go into the city center to play.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of ""三环外城乡结合部"" and the implicit contrast with ""城里"" suggests a spatial distinction between inside and outside the city center.
- The author implicitly recognizes the boundary of ""local area"" by referencing the Third Ring Road as a spatial marker.
- This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses local spatial categories to define where their home is and implies a social recognition of the city boundary.
- The author does not mention administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards.

Step 4: Output the results

- 三环外 (Outside the Third Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author mentions that many ""old local people"" (老土著) discriminate, especially those living in old, small, poor housing (老破小), mostly middle-aged and elderly.
- The author notes that even when talking about ""outside the Third Ring Road,"" many local people express a certain kind of negative attitude (弯脚杆的土著).
- The mention of ""三环外"" implies a spatial division used by locals.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the spatial boundary ""三环外"" (outside the Third Ring Road) as a recognized local spatial category, indicating a cognitive or symbolic boundary for ""local people"" or the local area.
- The mention of ""老土著"" (old locals) and their attitudes toward people or areas outside the Third Ring Road implies a vernacular spatial authority logic.
- The author implicitly acknowledges this spatial boundary as a standard or logic by which locals distinguish insiders and outsiders.

好像！！？你说的有道理！！！不过成都土著没有拆迁户过的轻松就不明白这优越感哪里来的hhh,Recognition Logic 6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 成都土著 (Chengdu locals)  
- 拆迁户 (resettled households due to demolition)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author suggests that Chengdu locals who have not experienced being resettled by demolition (""拆迁户"") cannot understand the source of a certain sense of superiority (""优越感""). This implies the author recognizes some identity or status difference based on experience with demolition resettlement.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The reference to ""拆迁户"" (resettled households) relates to social and economic experiences tied to housing/property and community embeddedness. The ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) likely relates to social embeddedness and economic status.  
- The author implies that those with demolition experience have a different local identity or social status compared to those who have not. This relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as property ownership, community ties, and social networks formed through such experiences influence local identity.

- 成都人 (Chengdu people)
- 陈冠希 (Edison Chen)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The text says ""成都人不是被骂的人吗？"" (A rhetorical question implying Chengdu people are criticized or mocked), ""陈冠希"" (name mentioned without explicit context), ""假打"" (fake fight), ""口音难听"" (accent is unpleasant), ""全是槽点"" (full of points to criticize).
- The mention of ""口音难听"" (accent unpleasant) relates to linguistic features.
- The author criticizes the accent of Chengdu people, implying that accent is a basis for negative evaluation.
- The author is focusing on the accent as a feature, possibly implying that accent is a standard used to judge identity.
- There is no explicit endorsement or positive agreement with the accent as a standard, only a negative mention.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author mentions accent (linguistic feature), which relates to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- However, the author only complains about the accent being unpleasant, which may imply recognition of accent as an identity marker.
- Since the task requires identifying standards the author agrees with or implicitly agrees with for defining ""local person,"" and here the author seems to acknowledge accent as a marker (even if negatively), it counts as RL4.
- No other logic is indicated.

- 外地同学同事 (non-local classmates and colleagues)
- 本地人 (local people)
- 拆迁户老嬢嬢 (relocation old ladies)
- 同学 (classmates)
- 外地朋友 (non-local friends)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author notes that from elementary school to working life, many classmates and colleagues are from outside the local area, and in nearly ten years of work across several companies, they have met few local people.
- The author suggests normal people have no superiority feeling, but some relocation old ladies have some superiority feelings, which annoy others.
- Non-local friends feeling uncomfortable can ignore those old ladies.
- Regarding marriage, most in the author's peer group marry locals (introduced by classmates), but some marry non-locals; the author cautions against being too certain about this.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes ""local people"" and ""non-local friends"" primarily by origin or birthplace, as implied by ""外地"" (non-local) and ""本地"" (local).
- The mention of classmates being local or non-local and marriage mostly within local people suggests a recognition logic based on family rootedness or growth history (RL3).
- The author does not mention administrative status, dialect, property, social embeddedness, or spatial boundaries explicitly.
- No explicit mention of vernacular spatial authority (RL1), administrative legitimacy (RL2), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).
- The core implied standard is about origin and growth history (whether someone is from the local area or not), especially in the marriage context.

- 四川其他地方 (other parts of Sichuan)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 成都: The author and their family live in Chengdu, have no other ""old home"" or ancestral hometown, and have settled by buying houses there. The author feels no particular superiority or inferiority about being local, indicating a sense of rootedness or family settlement in Chengdu.  
- 四川其他地方: People from other parts of Sichuan who come to work in Chengdu regard the author as a local and are envious.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author contrasts themselves with migrant workers from other parts of Sichuan who come to Chengdu to work, implying that being ""local"" means being born and raised or having family roots in Chengdu. The fact that the author's child feels uneasy for having no other hometown besides Chengdu also highlights the importance of family rootedness and generational settlement in defining local identity.  
- The purchase of houses and settling down in Chengdu is mentioned but not explicitly linked to defining ""local person"" identity by the author. The author states ""so no superiority or inferiority feeling,"" indicating no emphasis on property ownership as a criterion.  
- The mention that migrant workers see the author as local and envy them implies that the local identity is recognized based on family rootedness and origin, not administrative or linguistic criteria.

没有，倒是会被外地人歧视，说我说话口音牙尖弯酸，天天都说“电炒饭”,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""外地人"" (outsiders or non-locals)

Step 2: Match arguments: The author says they are discriminated against by outsiders because of their accent, specifically being mocked for pronunciation (""电炒饭""). This implies that speaking with a certain local dialect or accent is a marker of local identity.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic: The author implies that speaking the local dialect (or having the local accent) is a standard for defining ""local person"" identity, since the discrimination is based on accent differences.

Step 4: Output the results: RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)

Step 2: The author mentions that when working in Chengdu but from Dujiangyan, others criticize their accent as unpleasant. The author dismisses this criticism, saying they speak however they like and some people don't want to say more.

Step 3: The core argument relates to linguistic features (accent) used by others to judge the author, but the author resists or dismisses this judgment. The author does not accept accent as a valid standard for defining ""local person"" identity. Since the author is rejecting the use of accent as a criterion, this does not count as endorsing RL4.

Step 4: No other recognition logics are indicated as endorsed by the author.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- 成都: The author emphasizes family generational rootedness (several generations living in the same place), cultural-linguistic identity (speaking Chengdu dialect, shared cultural identity), deep social embeddedness (long-term friendships, family gatherings), and intimate knowledge of the city's changes and stories (local spatial knowledge and emotional attachment). The author explicitly contrasts this with property ownership and wealth, which are dismissed as markers of local identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- Generational family rootedness and ancestral ties → RL3 (Family Rootedness)  
- Speaking Chengdu dialect and cultural identity → RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition)  
- Intimate knowledge of the city, memories of local roads and changes → RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)  
- Long-lasting social relationships and family gatherings → RL6 (Social Embeddedness)  
- The author explicitly denies property ownership as a basis of local identity, so RL6 in terms of property is excluded; however, social embeddedness via family and friends is emphasized.

Step 2: Match arguments: The author states that in comparison to Shanghai, people directly say ""the way you speak (accent)"" is not understandable, and ask which county you are from. This implies that the author considers the local dialect or accent as a standard to recognize whether someone is a local or not.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic: The emphasis on accent and dialect as a marker of local identity corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 2: The author mentions that non-locals probably do not want their children to speak Sichuan dialect because the accent is hard to listen to, and even in marriage the dialect is involved.

Step 3: The author focuses on the dialect (四川话) as a factor related to identity or acceptance, implying that speaking the local dialect is a standard or at least a relevant factor in defining ""local person"" identity or insider status.

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 加拿大 (Canada)
- 美国 (USA)
- 日本 (Japan)
- 南门 (South Gate area in Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 成都: The author talks about Chengdu people loving to brag but younger generation being low-key; mentions having relatives who have studied or lived abroad; mentions many high-salary, home-buying outsiders in Chengdu; the author’s own husband is from outside Chengdu; author works in an internet circle mostly composed of outsiders.
- 南门: The author mentions owning two houses in South Gate area, even as a demolition household, and working hard with a high salary, but being modest.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind viewpoints:
- The author emphasizes that despite being a demolition household and owning houses in South Gate, they work hard, have a high salary, and are low-key. The pride or ""superiority"" comes from personal qualities like diligence, wisdom, kindness, and effort.
- The author does not use administrative hukou or family roots as standards.
- The author does not mention dialect or cultural habits as criteria.
- The author does mention owning property (two houses in South Gate) as part of their identity and pride, which can be linked to social embeddedness and economic status.
- The author does not discuss vernacular spatial authority (no mention of which areas are ""really"" Chengdu).
- The author mentions the social circle (internet circle, many outsiders), but does not use occupation as a defining standard.
- The author does not mention functional livability or convenience as a standard.
- The author explicitly embraces outsiders and does not look down on them, so no exclusionary administrative or spatial logic.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
1. 成都: ""真正的成都人都是不上班的"" implies a standard that locals do not work (occupational typification implied), ""土生土长的本地人都是享受生活的"" implies family rootedness or lifestyle.
2. 南门: ""南门那边都是外地来打工的"" implies outsiders work there, locals do not; also occupational typification and social embeddedness implied.

4. 华阳，龙泉: ""也能叫成都？只认五城区哈"" explicitly restricts local identity to five urban districts, implying vernacular spatial authority and administrative legitimacy.
5. 五城区: ""只认五城区"" and ""除了五城区，都是郊区"" implies spatial boundary defining local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The author defines ""local person"" by limiting ""local"" to ""五城区"" and calling other areas suburbs, which is a shared local perception of spatial boundaries.

给你讲个笑话，成都土著有优越感，哈哈哈哈哈哈,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 成都土著 (Chengdu locals)

Step 2: Match arguments: The author mentions ""成都土著"" and comments on their ""优越感"" (sense of superiority) but does not explain or endorse any specific standards that define who is a ""local person.""

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic: The text merely mocks or comments on the attitude (""优越感"") of Chengdu locals but does not reveal or endorse any standard or logic for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output the results: No recognition logic categories apply.

我来回答你吧，这个主要是看经济条件和双方家庭。比如本地土著，父母n套房，退休工资贼高的那种，自然是不可能愿意找县城里面务农，父母没得退休金的家庭。这个跟是不是成都土著没关系，放眼全国任何一个城市都是这样，毕竟婚姻需要门当户对。那么如果土著家庭条件一般，对方县城家里条件也差不多，且双方父母都有合适的退休金那也没得问题。总之就是对方其实是挑需不需要娃娃负担养老而不是挑地域。你试试县城有钱的他们还挑不挑？这个属于经济问题，跟地域没得太大的关系。,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 本地土著 (local native)
- 县城 (county town)
- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 全国任何一个城市 (any city in the country)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author argues that ""local native"" status is mainly related to economic conditions and family background (parents owning multiple houses, high retirement salary).
- The author states that marriage preferences are based on economic compatibility (""门当户对""), not on whether someone is a native of Chengdu or a particular region.
- The author emphasizes that economic conditions and family pension provisions are the real criteria for matching, not geographic origin.
- The author explicitly says this is a national phenomenon, not tied to specific city boundaries.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author does not endorse administrative legitimacy (hukou) or vernacular spatial authority as identity standards.
- The author emphasizes economic conditions and family background (parents' assets and pensions) as criteria for evaluating local identity or suitability.
- However, this is primarily an economic or social status evaluation, not a direct definition of ""local person"" identity.
- The author explicitly says ""this is an economic problem, not a regional one,"" and ""it has nothing to do with whether someone is a Chengdu native.""
- The text focuses on economic conditions and family status as criteria for marriage compatibility, not as criteria for defining local person identity.
- According to the instructions, discussions about wealth, social status, family economic conditions without explicitly or implicitly linking them to defining ""local person"" identity should not be annotated.
- The author does not state that economic condition or family assets are used to define who is a local person.
- The mention of ""local native"" is in contrast with economic conditions, suggesting the author rejects economic conditions as a definition of local identity.
- Therefore, no recognition logic categories apply.

Step 4: Output the results

- 成都 (Chengdu)
- 成都的老小区 (old neighborhoods in Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author discusses Chengdu's income level and urban renewal.
- The author notes that after city renovation, low-income people are pushed out.
- The author states that without low-income people providing services, living costs rise.
- The author praises the old neighborhoods in Chengdu for their living convenience and inclusiveness, allowing low-income people to live comfortably.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates ""local area"" quality based on living convenience, cost, and inclusiveness.
- The argument centers on the material environment and social composition affecting livability.
- The author implicitly values the old neighborhoods' functional livability and social inclusiveness.
- There is no explicit or implicit standard for defining ""local person"" identity based on administrative status, family roots, dialect, property, or occupation.
- The author focuses on livability and social inclusiveness of neighborhoods, which corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of low-income people contributing services and being part of the community hints at social embeddedness (RL6), as their presence impacts the community's social fabric and stability.
- However, the author does not explicitly define ""local person"" identity by social embeddedness or property ownership, only the community's inclusiveness.
- Since the author does not explicitly or implicitly define local identity by these standards, only RL5 applies as an evaluation of the ""local area.""

有每平方米一万以下的 一二环 老小区00年那种,N/A,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- ""一二环"" (First and Second Ring Road areas)  
- ""老小区"" (old residential areas)  
- ""00年那种"" (those from around the year 2000)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author mentions housing prices (""每平方米一万以下"" - below 10,000 RMB per square meter) in the context of ""一二环"" old residential areas from around 2000. This suggests a classification or evaluation of certain areas based on price and age of housing.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
The text focuses on the housing price and the age of the neighborhood but does not explicitly or implicitly use these to define who is a ""local person"" or to distinguish local identity. It discusses livability or housing conditions, which relates to functional livability, but the author does not link this to defining ""local person"" identity. Therefore, RL5 (Functional Livability) might be considered if the author uses housing price and area as a standard for defining local identity or area quality. However, the text is very short and only mentions price and area without explicit connection to local identity.

Given the short text and lack of explicit or implicit connection to defining ""local person,"" no RL category is clearly endorsed.

Step 4: Output the results

- 二环 (Second Ring Road area)
- 郊区 (suburban area)
- 成都 (Chengdu)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 二环内的房子 (houses within the Second Ring Road): The author mentions that their parents have worked in Chengdu for a long time, mostly living within the first or second ring, and friends are nearby. Buying a house in the suburbs is unrealistic, so buying and renovating a house within the 1-2 ring is the best plan.
- 郊区: Buying a house in the suburbs is considered unrealistic.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses the location within the city rings (1-2 rings vs. suburbs) as an important criterion related to ""local"" living. They mention parents working long in Chengdu and friends nearby, emphasizing social embeddedness.
- The mention of buying a house within the 1-2 ring and not the suburbs indicates the spatial hierarchy of local areas, which is a vernacular spatial authority logic (RL1).
- The mention of parents working in Chengdu for a long time and friends nearby indicates social embeddedness (RL6).
- The mention of buying a house for 1-2 million to get a better environment also touches on social embeddedness and the material basis of local identity (RL6).

Step 4: Output the result:

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to entities:
- 伊泰天骄 is close to the Second Ring Road.
- There are various noises and high density.
- The price is very high.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author mentions the high price and high density and noise but does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define ""local person"" identity or evaluate the scope of a ""local"" area in terms of local identity.
- The mention of price and noise is more about quality of living or property market, but no direct indication that this is a criterion for ""local person"" identity.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- No explicit or implicit evaluation of spatial boundaries or cultural-linguistic recognition.

Step 4: Since the author does not use any of these as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity, no RL categories apply.

- 楼梯房 (staircase buildings)
- 大平层 (large flat units)
- 联排别墅 (townhouses)
- 独栋别墅 (detached villas)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 楼梯房: associated with ""more sense of security,"" especially in emergencies like fire or elevator accidents.
- 大平层: dismissed as ""pseudo-improvement"" or ""pseudo-luxury house"" concept.
- 联排别墅 and 独栋别墅: regarded as the only real forms of housing worth recognition.
- 三环内: mentions prices of six or seven million yuan but no explicit judgment on identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes types of housing as a standard of identity or worthiness of ""local person"" recognition (""啥都是自己说了算"" - ""I decide everything""), implying a standard based on property ownership or housing type.
- The mention of security and preference for certain housing types (townhouses or detached villas) suggests a focus on property-based social embeddedness.
- The reference to ""三环内"" with prices is descriptive but not explicitly tied to identity definition.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, or occupational types.

Step 2: The author initially believes anyone within 哈尔滨's jurisdiction (including counties) counts as 哈尔滨 people. Then, the author saw on Xiaohongshu that some people claim county residents are rural and not 哈尔滨 people; only those from 道里 are considered old 哈尔滨 people.

Step 3: The author describes the spatial boundary of ""who counts as 哈尔滨 people"" based on administrative jurisdiction (counties vs city proper) and also mentions a social perception that only people from 道里 are considered true locals. The author is contrasting their own belief (administrative boundary) with a local vernacular perception (道里 as true local area). The author does not explicitly oppose or affirm the social perception but reports it.

However, the author themselves states ""只要是哈尔滨辖区内不管市里还是县里的都可以算是哈尔滨市的人"" — this is an explicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining local people.

Step 4: Therefore, the author's own standard is RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

- 区 (district)
- 县 (county)
- 周边县市 (surrounding counties and cities)
- 哈市 (Harbin city)
- 主城区 (main urban area)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- 周边县市的人说自己是哈市的，作者认为没什么问题，因为他们属于哈市辖区范围内。（author accepts administrative inclusion）
- 说自己是主城区土生土长的，作者觉得很搞笑。（author denies or mocks the claim of being ""born and raised"" in the main urban area）

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The acceptance that surrounding counties and cities belong to 哈市辖区范围内 indicates use of administrative jurisdiction or legitimacy to define local identity → RL2.
- The mocking of ""主城区土生土长"" (born and raised in main urban area) as a claim implies the author does not accept family rootedness in that area as a valid local identity claim; so RL3 is not endorsed.
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority, linguistic-cultural recognition, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 4: Output result:
Output: RL2"

- The author states that someone ""肯定不算北京人"" (definitely not considered a Beijing person).
- The reasons given are ""说话口音也不像"" (speaking accent is not similar) and ""文化背景也不同"" (cultural background is different).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- ""说话口音也不像"" (speaking accent is not similar) indicates using dialect or accent as a criterion → RL4 Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- ""文化背景也不同"" (cultural background is different) also relates to cultural-linguistic aspects, reinforcing RL4.

No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, or spatial authority. The author uses linguistic-cultural criteria to define who is a local Beijing person.

我家是双城的，后来工作考到了南岗。首先声明我一直说我是双城人，放心我没有说我是哈尔滨。最近在抖音上看到，因为口音然后有这种区分争论。其实按行政归属来说，9区12县的都可以说自己是哈尔滨的呀。看到抖音这些争论，我更要说我是双城人了，我从来没有觉得说是哈尔滨人能为我提升什么档次。也没有觉得说双城有什么羞愧的。别人说可能也只是为了方便别人知道家乡大概是什么位置。另一方面，每一个城市的发展都是由在本城市同生活奋斗的人一起共同努力的。无论你是老哈尔滨人还是新哈尔滨人。,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 双城 (Shuangcheng), 南岗 (Nangang), 哈尔滨 (Harbin), 9区12县 (9 districts and 12 counties)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 双城: The author identifies as a 双城人 (Shuangcheng person), not 哈尔滨人 (Harbin person). The author does not feel that being a Harbin person raises their social status, nor does being from Shuangcheng cause shame.
- 哈尔滨: The author notes that administratively, the 9 districts and 12 counties can all say they are from Harbin.
- The author references disputes on Douyin (TikTok) based on accent differences leading to distinctions between who is a local or not.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author acknowledges the official administrative boundary: ""按行政归属来说，9区12县的都可以说自己是哈尔滨的呀"" (According to administrative affiliation, the 9 districts and 12 counties can all say they are from Harbin). This is a direct appeal to administrative legitimacy.
- The author mentions disputes based on accent (口音) as a basis for distinguishing locals, but does not endorse this logic; rather, the author distances from that argument.
- The author emphasizes that city development depends on all who live and work there, regardless of old or new Harbin person. This suggests a rejection of strict lineage or linguistic-based identity.
- The author accepts administrative division as a standard for defining local identity but rejects accent-based or social status-based distinctions.

- 哈尔滨 (Harbin)
- 宾县 (Bin County)
- 呼兰 (Hulan)
- 阿城 (Acheng)
- 黑河 (Heihe)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- For 宾县: The author states that no one considers Bin County as Harbin, and residents distinguish themselves from Harbin. Traveling from Bin County to Harbin requires leaving the city and using the highway. People say ""come to Harbin"" and ""return to Bin County,"" indicating a clear distinction.
- For 呼兰 and 阿城: The author says these two places are even more distinct and not considered the same place.
- For 黑河: Although administratively the author's grandmother's home belongs to a city under Heihe, people never consider it part of Heihe; everyone calls their places separately, and the author doesn't think they have been to Heihe.
- For the city in general: Only the urban area is considered part of the city.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author uses habitual, collective perceptions about which areas count as part of the city and which do not, based on everyday social understanding, travel convenience, and emotional or social boundaries rather than official administrative divisions.
- The author explicitly rejects administrative legitimacy as the main criterion (e.g., grandmother's place belongs administratively to Heihe but is not considered Heihe).
- The distinctions are made on the basis of commonly accepted local perceptions and cognitive maps of the city and its surroundings.

- 呼兰区 (Hulan District)
- 阿城区 (Acheng District)
- 双城区 (Shuangcheng District)
- 郊县 (Suburban counties)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that old Harbin people recognize the early seven districts (including two canceled districts) and five counties as the main urban area of Harbin city.
- The current main urban area of Harbin includes the listed districts.
- Other areas are considered suburban counties.
- The author finally states that all people within the administrative area are Harbin people and it is unnecessary to distinguish.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions the early seven districts and five counties as the main urban area, indicating a local shared perception of what constitutes the ""real"" urban Harbin. This is a vernacular spatial authority concept.
- However, the author also emphasizes that all people within the administrative area are Harbin people, suggesting the use of administrative legitimacy (hukou or administrative boundary) as a basis for local identity.
- The author seems to reject finer distinctions among Harbin people based on these spatial boundaries, but the mention of administrative boundaries as inclusive suggests RL2 is endorsed.
- RL1 is endorsed through the description of ""old Harbin people's"" perception of urban scope.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The text says ""都是，又不是不属于哈尔滨"" which means ""All are, and not not belonging to Harbin,"" implying a discussion about whether something or someone belongs to Harbin.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is discussing belonging to Harbin, but there is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupation, or livability.
- The phrase ""not not belonging to Harbin"" suggests an acknowledgment of official or administrative belonging, but the text is very short and ambiguous.
- Since the author is focusing on belonging to Harbin, the likely logic is administrative legitimacy (RL2), as ""belongs to Harbin"" is an administrative category.

- The author questions the exclusion of certain districts or counties from being considered part of Harbin.
- The author critiques the viewpoint held by some ""old Harbin people"" who exclude these areas from Harbin identity.
- The author challenges the logic of excluding these areas by asking which city they belong to if not Harbin.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is focusing on which areas are considered legitimately part of the city Harbin.
- The debate is about spatial boundaries and which places count as ""local"" Harbin areas.
- The author is criticizing the exclusion based on some local people's perceptions.
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): the author is discussing the local cognitive/emotional maps and the contested scope of the city, highlighting disagreement about what counts as ""local"" Harbin.
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries explicitly (RL2), nor family roots (RL3), language (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupation (RL7).
- The author's core argument is about the spatial inclusion/exclusion and the local identity boundary.

- The example of Harbin sausage production being tied to county production is used to ridicule the logic of administrative boundaries as legitimacy.
- The Ice and Snow World ticketing rules as administrative artifacts are not legitimate markers of social worth.
- The author, as a Daqing person, holds a ""朴素的认知"" (simple understanding) that five districts and four counties belong to one city, and children from oil fields and wetlands grow up together.

我明白你的意思，但是哈尔滨市中心就在博物馆转盘道是因为沙俄来搞的城市建设就是做的跟铁路线平行后选择以那个地方为中心，沿东西大直街向路两边两边建设。正因为这地方是最老的市中心，所以省政府市政府一开始都在这里，省博物馆在这儿，老的哈一百在这儿，哈工大最老的楼也在这儿，两个大教堂也在这儿。中央大街属于是辅助的娱乐购物区域，对于沙俄人来说教堂才是他们生活的重点，博物馆加革新街总共两个教堂就因为它这地方重点。而你说的老道外那边是老哈尔滨人的聚集区，属于是本地人的市中心，但是它不是城市发展建设的市中心。哈尔滨是因为铁路而兴起的城市，所以真正的市中心一定是离铁路不远的。,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:

- 哈工大 (Harbin Institute of Technology)
- 两个大教堂 (Two big churches)
- 中央大街 (Central Avenue)
- 老道外 (Old Daowai district)
- 铁路 (Railway)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author explains that Harbin's city center is at the museum roundabout because the Russians built the city parallel to the railway, choosing this location as the center.
- The oldest city center houses the provincial and city government, museum, old schools, and churches.
- Central Avenue is an auxiliary entertainment and shopping area; churches were the main focus for Russians.
- Old Daowai is the gathering area for old Harbin locals and is the ""local people's city center,"" but it is not the urban development center.
- Harbin's real city center is near the railway due to its origin as a railway city.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses historical and spatial references to define what counts as the city center and local center.
- Emphasis on historical settlement and development patterns (oldest city center, Russian-built, proximity to railway).
- The author distinguishes between the ""local people's city center"" (老道外) and the official or urban development center.
- The distinction is based on spatial and historical urban development and collective recognition of what areas constitute the ""real"" city center or local center.
- The author's argument is about the spatial and historical legitimacy of local identity tied to specific areas.

This fits best with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The author discusses and endorses the logic of defining local identity and city center based on historical urban development and collective spatial understanding rather than administrative boundaries.

No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), dialect or cultural-linguistic criteria (RL4), functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as standards for defining local identity.

- Haxi (哈西)
- Qunli (群力)
- Jiangbei (江北)
- Beijing (北京)
- Fifth Ring Road (五环)
- Third Ring Road (三环)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- Harbin: City development moving to outskirts, old city area demolition unaffordable, Haxi and Qunli are popular areas, Jiangbei less developed.
- Haxi: Initially the most popular area for living, convenient due to location and transport.
- Qunli: Initially less popular, later developed to be more prosperous than Haxi.
- Beijing: The author lives between the 5th and 3rd ring roads, describes commuting difficulty and time costs.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author discusses the development and popularity of different urban areas (Haxi, Qunli, Jiangbei) in Harbin, emphasizing the convenience of living in the city center before the expansion of public transport. The argument is about how the spatial distribution and urban growth influence the desirability and local identity of areas.
- The focus is on convenience, transportation, and livability factors when discussing why living in the city center used to be better and now the situation changed.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The argument highlights the functional aspects of livability and convenience, linking these to the evaluation of different city areas as local living spaces.

- 工大附中 (Affiliated High School of Hefei University of Technology)
- 合肥工业大学 (Hefei University of Technology)
- 南一环 (South First Ring Road)
- 农村田地 (rural farmland)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 肥东: author's grandfather's generation was from Feidong, and had to pay money to get Hefei hukou when moving to the city.
- 市区/合肥: The author mentions birth location and schooling inside the city, indicating an association with the core city.
- The author reflects on past boundaries: university near South First Ring Road, beyond which was rural farmland.
- The author notes that in childhood, people from these areas were considered ""郊区"" (suburban or outskirts), implying a social recognition of spatial hierarchy.
- The author questions how many truly ""old Hefei"" locals there are.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The mention of grandfather's generation having to pay to get Hefei hukou (household registration) is an appeal to administrative legitimacy as a criterion of local identity. This is RL2.

- The detailed description of spatial boundaries (inside the South First Ring Road vs. rural farmland outside), and the social perception of these areas as ""郊区"" (suburbs) versus city core, indicates a vernacular spatial authority: collective emotional maps about what counts as ""real"" local area. This is RL1.

- The mention of family generational history (grandfather's generation) and the author being born and raised in the city, schooling locally, implies family rootedness as a criterion. This is RL3.

- No explicit mention of dialect or accent, functional livability, social embeddedness via property or connections, or occupational typification.

合肥一直都是移民城市，我93年到合肥，从幼儿园到高中，班上所谓纯正的合肥人就没几个，基本都是90年代跟着父母来的，都是普通话交流，合肥话都不会讲，你这些本地同事基本也应该是小时候移民过来的为主，就像我们这些人在别人看都是本地的，因为幼儿园就来了，但是其实也不是土生土长的,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 合肥 (Hefei)
- 本地同事 (local colleagues, implied group)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- Hefei is described as a city of immigrants.
- The author arrived in Hefei in 1993, attended school there from kindergarten to high school.
- Few classmates are ""pure"" locals; most came with parents in the 1990s.
- Communication is in Mandarin, not the local Hefei dialect.
- Local colleagues are also mostly immigrants from childhood.
- People like the author are seen as locals by others because they arrived young, but are not truly native born and raised.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes ""pure"" locals from immigrants based on family settlement history and upbringing (""土生土长"", born and raised locally).
- The emphasis on arrival in childhood vs. being native born relates to family rootedness and growth history.
- The mention of language (Hefei dialect) not spoken could suggest linguistic-cultural recognition, but the author notes ""basically speaking Mandarin,"" indicating they do not use dialect as a strict criterion.
- The author highlights the generational depth of local settlement (not ""土生土长"") as the core standard.

Therefore, the core logic the author implicitly uses to define local identity is RL3: Family Rootedness.

- No specific named spatial entities mentioned; general references to ""拆迁户"" (demolition households, often local residents displaced by urban development), and ""老年人"" (elderly people).

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that the area developed late, elderly people generally have lower education, many are demolition households.
- The author notes no discrimination intent but acknowledges that the elderly quality ""确实有待提高"" (indeed needs improvement).
- No explicit or implicit statement about defining ""local person"" identity by these factors.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses demographic and education level, but does not say these are criteria for judging who is a local person.
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, spatial boundaries, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or livability as identity criteria.
- The mention of demolition households and elderly is descriptive and possibly evaluative of social quality, not identity definition.

Step 4: Output the results:
No RL categories apply.

- 绿地的房子 (houses by Greenland)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
The text mentions locations and housing prices around these places. The author talks about the price level of houses near Xuehe Metro Station, but does not explicitly or implicitly discuss these locations as defining ""local person"" identity or standards for ""local area"" evaluation related to identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The text only provides factual information about housing prices and locations. There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation. The author does not express that these spatial or economic features are used to define who is a local person or the scope/quality of a local area in identity terms.

Step 2: The author states they are from 庐阳区 and believes that accent is the easiest way to distinguish locals, implying that accent or dialect is a key criterion for identifying local people. They also mention that more advanced recognition includes appearance and temperament, which differ by region. The author gives examples of regional distinctions like southern vs northern, and southwest vs central, and mentions a colleague who could distinguish people down to a few provinces based on appearance.

Step 3: The author uses accent (口音) as the easiest and primary way to distinguish locals, which aligns with Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition). The mention of appearance and temperament differences also relates to cultural or regional identity markers but the strongest and clearest standard expressed is accent/dialect. There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, social embeddedness, livability, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority as criteria.

Step 3: The author uses the local dialect (""合肥土话"") as a shared linguistic practice within the family and social circle, implying that speaking the local dialect is a criterion or standard for being considered a local person in Hefei.

Step 4: This corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matching entities:
- 上海和合肥消费差不多，水产类，牛肉类价格相似，贵的是外面吃饭的选择。
- 合肥出差时客户选择的饭店不便宜，但房价比江浙沪便宜，是优势。
- 作者在合肥住过几年，政务区，大约十年前，生活消费不便宜。

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author compares consumption costs and housing prices but does not use these as criteria for defining who is a ""local person"" or for judging ""local identity.""
- The mention of housing prices as an advantage is about economic conditions, not identity definition.
- The description of areas like 政务区, 天鹅湖, 万象城 is about consumption and living experience, not about spatial identity or local recognition.
- No mention or implication about hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- No indication that the author uses these factors to define ""local person"" identity or local area status.

Step 4: Conclusion: No recognition logic categories apply here since the author is discussing consumption and housing price differences, not defining ""local person"" identity or local identity standards.

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The author says they are a ""土生土长合肥人"" (native-born Hefei person).
- Before 2014, they loved Hefei and could not bear to leave.
- After 2014, they increasingly dislike staying in Hefei.
- They feel other cities are fresher, with less complicated traffic.
- Complains about complicated traffic and electric bike collisions in Hefei.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) to define themselves as a local Hefei person. This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The complaints about traffic and environment relate to livability but the author is expressing personal preference and dissatisfaction, not explicitly or implicitly using it as a standard to define who is a local person. So RL5 is not strongly endorsed as a standard for defining local identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.

合肥土著人，感觉合肥的名片从包拯故里改成大湖名城以后，面积大了不少，交通也在变的便捷，相应的民生政策并没有积极跟上，希望越来越好，做到真正的宜居,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 合肥 (Hefei)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 合肥:
- The author identifies as a ""合肥土著人"" (local person of Hefei).
- Notes that Hefei's ""名片"" (symbolic identity) changed from ""包拯故里"" (Bao Zheng's hometown) to ""大湖名城"" (big lake famous city), which implies an expansion of the city's recognized scope (""面积大了不少"").
- Mentions transportation is becoming more convenient.
- Comments that corresponding livelihood policies have not kept up.
- Hopes for improvement towards being truly livable.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author identifies as a local person (""土著人"") of Hefei, suggesting an identity rooted in the place.
- The mention of the city's symbolic identity changing from a historical figure's hometown to a big lake city and the increase in area reflects an understanding of city boundaries and symbolic meaning—this aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of transportation improvements and livability connects to functional livability (RL5), especially since the author hopes for the city to be truly livable.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use transportation or livability to define who is a local person, but rather comments on the city's qualities.
- The identity claim ""合肥土著人"" suggests family rootedness or growth history, but no explicit mention of family generations or ancestry is given, so RL3 is not clearly supported.
- No administrative legitimacy (RL2) is mentioned.
- No mention of dialect or cultural language (RL4).
- No mention of social embeddedness or property (RL6).
- No mention of occupational typification (RL7).

Therefore, the only clear recognition logic the author endorses to define local person identity is RL1, through the concept of the city's symbolic identity and spatial scope.

- 合肥 (Hefei)  
- 深圳 (Shenzhen)  
- 本地人 (local people)  
- 外地人 (outsiders)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 合肥: Population has increased a lot recently; overall management is lagging, e.g., parking is bad.  
- 本地人: There are quite a few local people; however, unlike Shenzhen, local people rarely benefit from rising housing prices; compared to outsiders who form the ""new Hefei people,"" local people's competitiveness is relatively weaker.  
- 外地人: Form the new Hefei people and have more competitiveness due to asset appreciation.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author discusses ""local people"" and ""new Hefei people"" in terms of competitiveness linked to asset appreciation (house prices). The author mentions ""local people"" do not benefit much from housing price increases, whereas outsiders do, which affects competitiveness.  
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly say that asset ownership or housing price gains are criteria for defining who is a local person. Instead, the author states ""本地人也不少的"" (there are many local people), which implies a recognition of local people as a category, but does not specify how local people are defined.  
- The discussion about ""local people"" and ""outsiders"" forming ""new Hefei people"" is about social/economic competitiveness and asset gains, not about the standard for defining local identity.  
- No mention of administrative legitimacy (hukou), family rootedness, dialect, or vernacular spatial authority.  
- No explicit or implicit endorsement of any recognition logic as the basis for defining ""local person.""  
- The discussion is about social/economic status and competitiveness, which is outside the task scope (not defining local person identity).

Step 4: Output the results  
The text does not provide any recognition logic that the author endorses or uses to define ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 大圩: The author mentions it as their hometown.
- 葡萄家园: Mentioned in relation to housing prices, questioning if it is the one with low prices.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author only states that their hometown is 大圩 and comments on housing prices of certain properties. There is no explicit or implicit indication that the author uses these factors to define ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of housing prices relates to property value but does not indicate the author endorses property ownership or value as a standard for defining local identity.
- No indication of RL1 (spatial identity), RL2 (administrative), RL3 (family roots), RL4 (linguistic), RL5 (functional livability as a standard for local identity), RL6 (social embeddedness), or RL7 (occupation) is found.

Step 2: The text discusses housing sizes, money spent on buying or renovating, rent subsidies, and demolition compensation, but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define ""local person"" identity or to evaluate the ""local"" area in terms of who is local.

Step 3: The text mainly discusses economic or financial conditions related to housing and subsidies, but does not connect these to local identity definitions or criteria.

Step 4: No recognition logic categories are identified because the text does not discuss or imply any standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to Hefei:
- The author mentions that their generation was forced to popularize Mandarin.
- They can understand the Hefei dialect but speaking it sounds awkward.
- Their mother asks about their accent.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes the dialect and accent (Hefei dialect) as a criterion for local identity.
- The awkwardness in speaking the local dialect and the question about accent imply that dialect/accent is a marker of ""local person"" identity.
- This matches Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

合肥四个行政区啊，为什么合肥人都爱把这种高新区说成行政区,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 合肥, 高新区  
Step 2: The author discusses the administrative divisions of 合肥 and points out that locals tend to call 高新区 an administrative district, even though it may not officially be one.  
Step 3: The author highlights a discrepancy between official administrative status and local perception or usage of spatial categories. This reflects an awareness of the difference between official boundaries and vernacular spatial categories that locals use to define or understand ""local"" areas.  
Step 4: This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1) Vernacular Spatial Authority, because the author is addressing how locals perceive and label areas differently from official administrative designations. There is also mention of administrative divisions but the author does not endorse administrative legitimacy as the standard, rather they emphasize local usage. Therefore, RL2 is not endorsed here.  
Output: RL1"

Step 2: The author states that 高新区 has its own school district, administrative affairs are managed by the 管委会, residents do not go to 蜀山区 for administrative matters, property certificates belong to 高新区, only the ID card is from 蜀山区.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses administrative management and official documentation (school district, 管委会 management, property certificate) as criteria for defining local belonging.
- The mention of the ID card being from 蜀山区 but other administrative and property affiliations being 高新区 implies the author prioritizes administrative legitimacy and official governance over just the ID card location.

Thus, the author is endorsing Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

- 包河 and 蜀山: described as ""发展比较好的区"" (developmentally better areas), ""更强些"" (stronger).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses convenience of buying things, livability, and development level to evaluate areas.
- The author does not mention administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types.
- The author uses material infrastructure and livability factors to define or evaluate the quality of these local areas.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions ""市区产证"" (urban property certificate) as an advantage of 新站. This is an appeal to official administrative status of the area and property rights, which relates to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The mention of subway lines and life convenience relates to livability or functional convenience, which corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of industrial zones and large factories supporting the area may relate to occupational typification (RL7), but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these to define ""local person"" identity or area quality in terms of local identity. It is more a description of economic support.
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly use family rootedness, dialect, vernacular spatial authority, or social embeddedness as standards.

- The author says that 政务区 is only an economic division but administratively still belongs to 蜀山区.
- The author compares this to 深圳 and the country relationship: 深圳 is an economic special zone but still part of the country.
- The author notes that most local people refer to 天鹅湖 as ""蜀山区天鹅湖,"" implying the local perception of area boundaries.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes administrative divisions (政务区 vs. 蜀山区) and clarifies that from an administrative point of view, the area belongs to 蜀山区. This aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The author also points out that locals commonly recognize 天鹅湖 as part of 蜀山区, reflecting a shared local perception or vernacular spatial understanding of area boundaries beyond official economic divisions. This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

- The author questions which specific part of 滨湖 is like this, since their acquaintances living there feel the area is large but sparsely populated and lacking good commercial circles.
- The author does not explicitly endorse the ""livability"" standard as a definition of a local person but mentions the livability claim as a social perception.
- The author is curious and somewhat skeptical about the livability claim but does not deny or resist it as a standard.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author references ""宜居"" (livable), ""吃喝玩乐方便"" (convenient eating, drinking, entertainment), and commercial circle presence.
- These correspond to functional livability standards (RL5).
- The author does not discuss administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.
- The author is discussing livability as a characteristic of the area, but does not explicitly or implicitly use it to define who is a local person. The author is questioning the area's livability but not whether that determines local identity.
- Since the task requires focusing on standards used to define ""local person"" identity, and the author only discusses livability of the area without linking it to local identity, this does not meet the core annotation requirement.
- The author is not using RL5 as a standard to define ""local person"" identity.
- Therefore, no RL category should be annotated.

Step 4: Output the result.

- 包河区 (Baohe District)
- 高新区 (High-tech Zone)
- 政务区 (Administrative District)
- 护城河内的老居民 (Old residents inside the moat)
- 省立安医 (Provincial Hospital)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- Baohe District is described as the best in government terms, with impressive statistics.
- High-tech Zone is best from the industrial employment perspective, reachable by ordinary people through personal effort.
- Administrative District offers the best personal experience: relatively new, mature facilities, good living experience.
- For old residents inside the moat, development in the outskirts is less relevant; their focus is on top education, medical facilities, core commerce, comfort, convenience, and social relations (neighbors, familiar circles).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- The author distinguishes areas not by administrative boundaries but by their functions, social and living experience, infrastructure, and social embeddedness.

- The focus on personal experience of living conditions, convenience of walking to school, nearby hospital, local neighborhood social interactions indicates RL5 (Functional Livability) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

- The differentiation of areas based on employment and government statistics (Baohe District, High-tech Zone) is more about development level but not explicitly about defining ""local person"" identity.

- The author emphasizes the importance of local social networks (""邻里的热火劲"", ""孩子发小搭把手"", ""熟人圈"") and convenience in daily life, which relate to RL6.

- The mention of ""护城河内的老居民"" (old residents inside the moat) suggests a recognition of family rootedness or historical residence, implying RL3.

- 高新 (High-tech Zone)
- 滨湖 (Binhu)
- 庐阳 (Luyang)
- 蜀山区 (Shushan District)
- 老城新区 (Old City New District)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 高新: ""产业而言，综合下来高新是大哥"" (In terms of industry, overall High-tech Zone is the top)
- 滨湖: ""环境而言，滨湖是最舒服的"" (In terms of environment, Binhu is the most comfortable)
- 庐阳: ""烟火气而言个人感官庐阳最有感觉"" (In terms of ""smoky atmosphere"" or local life feel, personally Luyang feels the most)
- 蜀山区: ""按行政区域来算，蜀山区无疑"" (By administrative area, Shushan District is undoubtedly [top])
- 老城新区: ""产业环境都有的"" (Old City New District has both industry and environment)

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author compares areas by different attributes: industry, environment, ""smoky atmosphere"" (local life feel), and administrative divisions.
- The mention ""按行政区域来算"" (according to administrative division) explicitly uses administrative boundaries as a standard to evaluate the area.
- The other standards (industry, environment, local life feel) are evaluations of the area's functional or experiential qualities, which relate to livability and social atmosphere but do not explicitly define ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not explicitly or implicitly state that these attributes define who is a local person.
- The mention of administrative division might imply RL2 if the author uses it to define ""local person,"" but here it is used to evaluate the area's status or ranking.
- Since the task is to annotate recognition logic the author uses to define ""local person,"" and the author only evaluates areas by administrative division, industry, environment, and local atmosphere, with no direct link to defining ""local person,"" no RL categories apply.
- The mention of administrative division is about the area's status, not about judging people as locals.
- The mentions of industry, environment, and local life feel are evaluations of area quality, not identity definition.

- 滨湖、新站: No experience, no comment.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates areas based on livability factors such as presence of school districts, hospitals, convenience of location, environment, and development level.
- These factors relate to urban functional infrastructure and quality of life.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types.
- The author does not discuss who counts as a ""local person"" directly but evaluates areas in terms of suitability for living.
- Since the author describes the area suitability based on livability and convenience, this aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The author does not explicitly connect these standards to defining ""local person"" identity, but the instruction says to annotate only if the author uses these to define or evaluate ""local person"" identity or ""local area"" quality.
- The author evaluates the ""local"" area quality and suitability for living, which is within RL5 scope.
- No direct or implied mention of using these standards to define ""local person"" identity, only area evaluation.
- The task states: ""If the author considers an area an ideal 'local' living space due to RL5 characteristics, or believes an area does not meet the standard of a 'good local' area due to a lack of RL5 characteristics,"" it should be annotated.
- The author states Luyang is suitable for living because of school district, hospital, and location convenience, so the author endorses RL5 as a standard to evaluate a ""local"" area.
- No evidence the author uses these to define ""local person"" identity, only to evaluate ""local"" area quality.
- Since the task includes ""or to evaluate the quality/scope of a 'local' area,"" RL5 applies.

Step 2: The author states they are a ""土生土长合肥蜀山区人"" (native born and raised in Hefei Shushan District), which implies family rootedness and local identity based on birth and upbringing. The author prefers living environments with good greenery and fewer people, which influences their house-buying choice (Dashushan area and Binhu).

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- ""土生土长"" (native born and raised) relates to RL3: Family Rootedness.
- Preference for good greenery and fewer people as living environment is about livability and environmental quality, but the author does not explicitly say these define ""local person"" identity, only their personal preference for buying a house. Since the author does not link livability standards to defining ""local person"" identity, RL5 is not annotated here.

瑶海排除，乱死了尤其龙岗这边长江批发市场这里，绿灯过斑马线一堆开电瓶车运货的一点也不看，就上来撞人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 瑶海, 龙岗, 长江批发市场

Step 2: The author complains about chaotic traffic conditions near 龙岗's 长江批发市场 area and excludes 瑶海. The mention of 瑶海 being excluded (""瑶海排除"") suggests a boundary or area classification.

Step 3: The author implicitly uses spatial distinctions to define which areas are problematic or perhaps not considered ""local"" or desirable. The exclusion of 瑶海 and the negative description of 龙岗's market area imply a spatial boundary and evaluation.

This fits Recognition Logic 1 (RL1) Vernacular Spatial Authority: the author assumes or uses local spatial perceptions to classify areas as distinct and evaluatively different.

No mention or implication of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, linguistic-cultural recognition, livability in terms of amenities, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The statement discusses traffic congestion in the old city area.
- The author is commenting on the livability or functional convenience of the area (traffic conditions).
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly claim that traffic congestion or ease of transportation is a standard for defining who is a local person.
- The statement does not discuss identity, belonging, or local person status.
- It only describes a characteristic of the area (traffic jam), which might relate to functional livability but not used here as a standard for ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output the results:

- 工业园 (Industrial Park)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 肥东 is described negatively: worst area, poor air environment, poor traffic, inadequate facilities, floods when raining, earthquake center.  
- Industrial Park is mentioned but no specific evaluation beyond ""not to mention"" (implying it is bad).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic  
- The author is evaluating the area based on environmental quality, infrastructure, and livability factors (air quality, traffic, facilities, flooding, earthquake risk).  
- The author does not explicitly state or imply that these factors are used to define who is a ""local person"" or to judge local identity. Instead, these are evaluations of the area's material conditions.  
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational groups, or vernacular spatial authority about local identity.  
- Therefore, the evaluation is about the livability or functional quality of the area.

Step 4: Output the results  
- Since the author is judging the area based on livability factors, this corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).  
- However, the task states to only annotate standards the author uses to define ""local person"" identity or evaluate a ""local"" area as a ""local"" area. Here the author is judging the area as ""worst,"" which is an evaluation of the area's quality. The author is implicitly using RL5 to evaluate the ""local"" area.  
- This meets the criteria for RL5.

- 一环二环 (First and Second Ring Roads)
- 三号线地铁 (Metro Line 3)
- 市中心 (City center)
- 38中 (No. 38 Middle School)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 瑶海区: The author says ""还行吧"" (it's okay), especially near the first and second ring roads.
- One key point is that near the author's home there is Metro Line 3 and buses directly to the city center.
- The district has a good middle school (38中).
- The author emphasizes transportation convenience and good education resources.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the presence of good transportation (metro, bus) and good school (38中) as positive evaluations of the area.
- This is about livability and convenience of urban functions.
- The author is endorsing these material and functional characteristics as criteria for evaluating the area.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational types, or vernacular spatial perceptions.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities: The text only states ""交通确实很方便的"" (""The transportation is indeed very convenient""). There is no mention of a place or a person.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic: The statement praises transportation convenience but does not explicitly or implicitly connect this to defining a ""local person"" or the identity of ""local"" areas. It only comments on a livability feature, without indicating that this is a standard for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results: No recognition logic categories apply.

Output:"
是真的很方便 就是房价贵了噻，改善也没有选择,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities: None explicitly mentioned.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author mentions convenience (""真的很方便"") but also that house prices are high (""房价贵了"") and there is no choice for improvement (""改善也没有选择""). However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly state that convenience or housing price is used as a criterion to define who is a ""local person"" or what counts as a local area.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: The mention of convenience and housing prices relates to functional livability (RL5), but since the author does not use these as standards for defining ""local person"" identity or evaluating local identity scope, it does not meet the annotation criteria.

我小时候从济钢到市区叫做“去济南”。……而且还要坐火车去“济南”，那时济钢桥头有个374车站，编号是距离青岛站374公里的意思，后面改叫韩仓站，现在废弃了。后来有了8路、10路公交车……现在公交、地铁一应俱全，不过不超过CBD（原二钢）还是电瓶车最方便,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 济钢 (Jigang)
- 市区 (urban area, the city center)
- 济南 (Jinan)
- 济钢桥头374车站 / 韩仓站 (train station)
- 青岛站 (Qingdao station)
- CBD (Central Business District, originally Ergang)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author recalls childhood terminology: traveling from 济钢 to 市区 was called ""going to 济南,"" implying a perception that 济钢 was not considered part of 济南 proper.
- The author notes historical transport: train station numbering and changes, and now improved bus and metro services.
- The author mentions that transportation is convenient but within the CBD (originally Ergang), electric carts are still most convenient.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies a spatial boundary or local perception that 济钢 is not really ""Jinan"" proper, as traveling from there to city center was considered going ""to Jinan."" This is a vernacular spatial perception, not an administrative boundary.
- The mention of transport improvements and convenience relates to livability but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a criterion for defining who is local or what is local identity.
- The core point is about the perception of the city scope and boundaries from a local perspective.

我小时候以前从章丘到济南还有收费站,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 章丘, 济南

Step 2: The author mentions traveling from 章丘 to 济南 and that there used to be toll stations between them.

Step 3: The mention of toll stations and traveling between two places might imply a spatial boundary or division, possibly reflecting a local perception of city scope or area boundaries. However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly state that this defines who is a local person or the local identity standard. It is more a description of a fact about transportation or administrative boundaries.

Step 4: Since the author does not express a standard for defining ""local person"" identity or local area evaluation, no recognition logic applies.

- 东八里洼 (Dongbaliwa)
- 章丘 (Zhangqiu)
- 奥体附近 (near Olympic Sports Center)
- 泉城路 (Quancheng Road)
- 市里 (city center)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
The author describes the spatial boundaries of Jinan city as they remember from childhood: western boundary around Hexie, eastern at Dianliuzhuang, northern at Luokou, southern at Dongbaliwa. Mentions rural roads beyond Dianliuzhuang, and even after moving near Olympic Sports Center for over ten years, going to Quancheng Road is still considered ""going to the city.""

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author uses habitual spatial perceptions of city boundaries, defining which areas count as ""city"" or ""local"" and which do not, based on lived experience and shared local spatial knowledge rather than administrative divisions. This reflects Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1). There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, or other criteria.

- 天桥槐荫: The author notes someone stayed here for 20 years in childhood.
- 领秀城: The author mentions moving here as a mark of becoming a true old Jinan local.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author implies that being a ""true old Jinan local"" is not just about birthplace but also about moving to certain areas (领秀城) when financially able.
- The reference to childhood residence (20 years in 天桥槐荫) and moving to a new area suggests a logic based on family rootedness or growth history.
- The author highlights a spatial distinction between areas (天桥槐荫 vs 领秀城) to define ""old Jinan local,"" reflecting a spatial authority perspective.

Step 4: Output the results:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): The author uses spatial distinctions within Jinan to define ""old locals.""
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): The mention of childhood years and moving when able implies growth history and family rootedness as criteria.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author and relatives use spatial boundaries and local habitual perceptions (moat inside, ring roads) to define what counts as the local city area or local identity.
- This is an example of Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1): subjective, habitual, and collective perceptions of city boundaries, not official administrative divisions.
- The author explicitly says the inner ring is considered the real city or local area, despite development outside.

- The author is a person from Zhangqiu.
- When at university, the author claims to be from Jinan.
- People from other districts think the author is ""碰瓷"" (pretending or falsely claiming).
- The author questions why Zhangqiu City is considered less prestigious or less ""大气"" (magnanimous, grand) than districts.
- The author implies that Zhangqiu City is not smaller or less important than districts of Jinan.
- The author challenges the idea of whether Zhangqiu counts as part of Jinan or not in terms of identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic
- The author disputes the idea that Zhangqiu is lesser than other districts of Jinan, implying a challenge to the spatial or administrative boundary defining ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of ""章丘市"" vs ""区"" and the comparison between them relates to administrative divisions and their legitimacy.
- The author implicitly critiques the legitimacy of administrative boundaries (district vs city) as a standard for defining local identity.
- The author expresses a sense of local identity tied to Zhangqiu as a city, rather than being subsumed under Jinan districts.
- This reflects a concern with administrative legitimacy (RL2).
- There is also an implied vernacular spatial authority (RL1) logic: questioning the common perception or emotional map of whether Zhangqiu counts as ""local"" Jinan or not.
- The author challenges the social recognition or collective emotional map about what counts as ""Jinan"" locals.
- The statement ""别的区的觉得我碰瓷"" implies social recognition issues around spatial boundaries.

Step 2: The author discusses the area of 济南市区 and expresses a negative attitude toward it, implying that being included in 济南 (administrative area) is not necessarily positive. The author mentions ""被划进来"" (being incorporated), which implies administrative boundary inclusion.

Step 3: The author refers to ""被划进来"" (being incorporated into) as a standard or basis of local identity but expresses dislike for it. The mention of ""被划进来"" relates to administrative division or jurisdiction. However, the author is criticizing this standard rather than endorsing it.

The author does not endorse the administrative legitimacy standard (RL2) but rather questions it or expresses dissatisfaction. There is no explicit or implicit endorsement of any recognition logic.

Step 4: Since the author does not endorse any standard for defining ""local person"" identity but only critiques administrative inclusion, no RL labels apply.

- 十二马路 (Shier Malu)
- 纬一路 (Wei Yilu)
- 经一路 (Jing Yilu)
- 十一马路 (Shiyi Malu)
- 二环 (Second Ring Road)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that according to traditional thought in 老槐荫, the area bounded by 十二马路 (west), 纬一路 (east), 经一路 (north), 十一马路 (south) is considered ""偏"" (relatively remote or peripheral). The author also implies that anything outside the 二环 (Second Ring Road) is considered rural (""农村"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is expressing a traditional, local spatial categorization of which areas are considered central or peripheral, and explicitly says ""outside the Second Ring Road is rural,"" implying that areas outside the ring are not considered truly urban or local.
- This is an example of vernacular spatial authority, using habitual, historically sedimented local perceptions to define what counts as ""local"" or not.

- The author describes their childhood perception of the city center area, bounded by several landmarks. The author claims to only recognize this ""circle"" as the core area.
- The author’s husband, also from Jinan, does not recognize the roads, implying the author’s limited recognition is based on a specific spatial definition.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author defines the ""local"" area by a habitual, shared, spatial perception of what constitutes the city center, based on landmarks and emotional maps, not official administrative boundaries.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author uses a cognitive map to define the local core area.

- The author is puzzled by the roommate's pride because double-decker buses were common when they were children.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The roommate emphasizes the bus line as a symbol of their local area identity.
- The author does not explicitly endorse this as a local identity standard but reports the roommate's pride.
- The text shows a spatial association of a feature (double-decker bus line) with a district (Licheng), but the author does not endorse this as a standard for defining ""local person.""
- No explicit or implicit recognition logic about ""local person"" identity is expressed by the author.

龙洞似乎并不介意自己属不属于济南市区，只知道自己最贵就可以了,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 龙洞, 济南市区

Step 2: The author says that 龙洞 ""does not care whether it belongs to 济南市区, only knows it is the most expensive."" This suggests that the author notes 龙洞's attitude is indifferent to administrative belonging, focusing instead on price.

Step 3: The author implies that 龙洞's local identity or evaluation is based on being ""the most expensive,"" i.e., price or economic status. However, the author does not explicitly say they agree with this as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity or local area evaluation. The author only reports 龙洞's attitude.

Does the author endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2)? No, because the author says 龙洞 does not care about belonging to 济南市区 (administrative division).

Does the author endorse economic status as a standard for local identity? The recognition logic framework does not have an explicit category for economic status alone unless it is linked to social embeddedness (RL6) (e.g., owning property as a sign of local embeddedness). The author only says ""most expensive,"" which could be related to RL6 if the author endorses this as a local identity standard.

But the author just states 龙洞 ""does not care"" about administrative belonging, only cares about being ""most expensive."" There is no clear endorsement from the author that price is a standard to define local identity.

Therefore, this text only describes 龙洞's attitude, no explicit or implicit endorsement by the author for any recognition logic.

- 小商品批发市场 (small commodity wholesale market)
- 汽车站 (bus station)
- 动物园 (zoo)
- 市区 (urban area/downtown)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author is commenting that even though the small commodity wholesale market has a bus station and a zoo, it still does not count as the urban area (""市区"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author is expressing a standard about what counts as the urban core or city proper. This relates to shared local perceptions of spatial categories (which areas count as ""市区"" or urban core), not based on official boundaries but on local understanding.

This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author is judging whether a place ""counts"" as the urban area based on commonly shared perceptions and symbolic meaning.

No indication of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) is present.

- 济南 (Jinan)
- 历城 (Licheng)
- 莱芜 (Laiwu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says that when they were young, they thought Licheng was a suburb.
- For Laiwu, it was recently merged into Jinan, and most people from Laiwu still identify as Laiwu people in terms of belonging.
- The author expresses a personal viewpoint on the sense of belonging or identity regarding these areas.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes identity based on the administrative change (Laiwu just merged into Jinan), and the people's self-identification regarding their origin.
- The mention that ""Laiwu was just merged recently"" and people still identify as Laiwu people reflects awareness of administrative boundaries and their impact on identity.
- The idea that Licheng was considered a suburb reflects a vernacular spatial perception, i.e., the collective or personal perception of what counts as core urban area or suburb.
- Therefore, the author uses both vernacular spatial authority (RL1) and administrative legitimacy (RL2) to define local identity.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions that their father can distinguish the accent differences among the four gates (东西南北四关), but the author themselves cannot even distinguish the accents between Zhangqiu (章丘) and Jinan (济南).  
- The author expresses surprise at how such small areas have accent differences.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The focus is on distinguishing people based on accent differences, i.e., linguistic differences used to recognize local identity or belonging.  
- The author is acknowledging that accent differences exist and are recognized by locals (their father), implying that accent is a criterion used to differentiate insiders from outsiders or among locals.  
- This corresponds to RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

The author says ""高新不是行政区划啊"" (""Gaoxin is not an administrative division""), implying that defining local identity based on administrative divisions is not accurate or appropriate here.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author implies that ""高新"" is not an administrative district, so administrative legitimacy (RL2) is not the correct or sole standard.
- The author divides people into those in ""历下"" and those in ""历城,"" which are known city districts. This implies the author is using spatial categories to distinguish locals.
- The mention of these spatial divisions and rejection of administrative division as a logic suggests the author endorses Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1) rather than Administrative Legitimacy (RL2).

- 历城: 没去过但是知道在市里 (never been, but knows it is in the city)
- 章丘长清平阴: 已经不在市里了 (already not in the city)

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- 历下: emphasizes facilities and convenience of living — this is about functional livability (RL5).
- 市中: mentions famous places and old commercial areas; mostly descriptive, no direct definition of local person, more like landmarks.
- 天桥: childhood memories and growing up here — implies family rootedness or growth history (RL3).
- 高新: ""都是上流社会的人"" (all upper class people), ""绿化挺好"" (good greenery) — mentions social class and environment; social class implies social embeddedness (RL6), greenery is RL5.
- 槐荫: mentions places but unsure if they are in Huaiyin; no direct identity standard.
- 历城: ""知道在市里"" — spatial awareness, possibly vernacular spatial authority (RL1).
- 章丘长清平阴: ""已经不在市里了"" — spatial boundary definition, vernacular spatial authority (RL1).

红谷滩，不过生活成本也相对高一些,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 红谷滩

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author mentions 红谷滩 and states that ""生活成本也相对高一些"" (living costs are relatively higher).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author comments on the living cost of 红谷滩, which relates to the material conditions or functional livability of the area.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that this living cost standard is used to define who is a ""local person"" or to evaluate the identity or scope of ""local"" areas.
- The comment is about living cost, a social/economic factor, but no indication that this is a standard for defining local identity.
- Therefore, no recognition logic category applies because the author does not use this as a criterion for ""local person"" identity.

Step 2: The author argues that the definition of ""市中心"" (city center) is unrelated to tradition or cultural heritage, but rather depends on the presence of leading cultural, educational, medical, and commercial facilities. The author uses the example of ""cbd"" (central business district) to illustrate that wherever the cbd is located, that place is the city center.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author is rejecting traditional or cultural rootedness (RL3 or RL4) as a criterion.
- The author emphasizes functional aspects: cultural, educational, medical, commercial leadership — i.e., functional livability and infrastructural importance.
- This aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability), as the author defines the ""city center"" based on functional dominance and infrastructure rather than tradition or cultural identity.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic category labels the author endorses for defining ""city center"" (a proxy for local spatial identity): RL5

南昌很多中心地区，只是不同的地方不同的定位，如果说哪里最好，按照房价来，是红谷滩,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities: 南昌, 红谷滩  
Step 2: The author mentions different central areas of 南昌 have different positioning. If judging which is best, the author uses house price as the criterion, stating 红谷滩 is the best by this standard.  
Step 3: The author uses ""house price"" (property price) as a measure of which area is better or more desirable. This relates to economic status and embeddedness in the local social fabric, implying that areas with higher house prices are more ""local"" or better local areas. This fits RL6 (Social Embeddedness). However, the author does not explicitly say that this is a criterion for defining who is a ""local person,"" but rather for which area is better. The task says only annotate if the author uses this standard to define local identity or evaluate the quality/scope of a local area. The author evaluates ""which area is best"" by house price, which is an evaluation of a local area's quality, so RL6 applies.  
Step 4: Output RL6.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author identifies as an ""old Nanchang person.""
- The author states that even when now living in Honggutan District or the old city area, people still habitually say ""go to the city center"" (去市内).
- This suggests a habitual or vernacular spatial perception that distinguishes between areas considered ""inside the city"" (core local area) and those outside.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The phrase ""还是习惯说‘去市内’"" (still habitually say ""go to city center"") implies a vernacular spatial classification that the author endorses or uses, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- There is no mention of administrative division, hukou, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as defining local identity here.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author claims that the city center is around Bayi Square, and the so-called First and Second Ring Roads are expansions outward from Bayi Square.
- The author ridicules the idea of considering Honggutan as part of the local center.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is discussing how to define the core local area spatially, implying that only areas near Bayi Square count as the true city center, dismissing others like Honggutan.
- This reflects a shared or habitual local perception of spatial boundaries within the city, not based on administrative divisions but on common local understanding of the ""real"" city center.

- 市中心 (city center)
- 八一广场 (Bayi Square)
- 南昌 (Nanchang)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author says Honggutan was a wilderness when they were young, but now it is a new district. Using Honggutan as a reference point is good for showing face.
- However, for ""us locals,"" the city center is definitely Bayi Square.
- The author's childhood memories of Nanchang are definitely around Bayi Square.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author contrasts the new district (Honggutan) with the traditional city center (Bayi Square), emphasizing that locals recognize the city center as Bayi Square.
- The emphasis on ""locals"" identifying the city center as Bayi Square and the author’s childhood memories there implies a shared vernacular spatial authority or local spatial identity standard.
- The mention of ""for us locals"" and ""childhood memories"" implies RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it reflects the shared local perception of the core urban area.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that the true city center of Nanchang is the area around Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, and Ruzi Road.
- Honggutan used to be very undeveloped and had many non-locals, but now it has developed well.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author, who identifies as a native local, uses the traditional central areas (Donghu District, Bayi Square, Zhongshan Road, Ruzi Road) as the authentic core local area.
- Honggutan is considered less ""local"" historically due to its recent development and many outsiders.
- This reflects a shared local perception of spatial categories, distinguishing older central areas from newer developments and outsider presence.
- Therefore, this is Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1).

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author thinks calling 红谷滩 the city center is laughable.
- Even for non-natives, listening to the traffic broadcast shows that going from 八一大桥 to 红谷滩 is called ""out of town"" direction.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses a vernacular spatial perception (""出城方向"" = out of town direction) to argue that 红谷滩 is not part of the core city.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 红谷滩: The author grew up there when it was called 昌北, describing it as a desolate area. It was considered outside the true 南昌 city center until it developed (construction of buildings, metro, government relocation, renaming to 红谷滩区). Now it is considered the city center.
- 八一桥: Marked as a boundary—""beyond Bayi Bridge is the real Nanchang.""
- 东湖: When going to Donghu area, people say they are going to Nanchang, implying Donghu is recognized as within Nanchang.
- The author accepts the current administrative reclassification and development as justifying the new city center status of 红谷滩.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author defines ""local person"" identity or city center status based on:
  - The spatial boundary perception that ""beyond Bayi Bridge is the real Nanchang"" (a vernacular spatial boundary not necessarily official). This is RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
  - The author accepts the administrative renaming from 红谷滩新区 to 红谷滩区 and the relocation of government offices as evidence of the new city center status, which is an appeal to administrative legitimacy. This is RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
  - The author mentions growing up in 红谷滩 (formerly 昌北) and childhood memories, which indicates a family rootedness or individual growth history in the area. This supports RL3 (Family Rootedness).
  - The mention of development like building metro, CBD, and government relocation suggests livability and functional improvements, which the author uses to justify the new center status. This relates to RL5 (Functional Livability).

- The author mentions their husband is a ""南昌土著"" (native/local person of Nanchang).
- The husband recalls that ""红谷滩"" was once a barren wasteland when he was a child.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The statement ""我老公南昌土著"" implies that the husband's identity as a local person is based on being born and raised there (family rootedness, growth history).
- The mention of childhood memories (""小时候红谷滩就是一片荒滩"") supports the idea of long-term residence or growth history in the place.

黄明他妈我见过，标准的市里人，不是胶州口音,Recognition Logic 4,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 黄明他妈 (Huang Ming's mother)  
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou, a place name referring to a region with a distinct accent)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author claims ""黄明他妈"" is a ""标准的市里人"" (standard city person), and supports this by noting ""不是胶州口音"" (does not have Jiaozhou accent). This implies that speaking with a non-Jiaozhou accent is a criterion for being considered a standard city local.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The criterion focuses on accent/dialect (""不是胶州口音""), which corresponds to linguistic-cultural recognition.  
- The author implicitly uses linguistic-cultural features (dialect/accent) to define local identity.

我也是城阳人，听到市里口音够够的，高贵的很,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""城阳"" (Chengyang), ""市里"" (the city center or downtown area).

Step 2: The author says ""我也是城阳人"" (""I am also a Chengyang person""), then comments on the city center's accent as ""够够的，高贵的很"" (""very strong, very noble""). This implies a recognition or evaluation based on accent or dialect.

Step 3: The author's statement shows that being from Chengyang is an identity, and the city center's accent is distinctive and carries social connotations. The author uses the accent as a marker of identity or difference.

This matches Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

- 青岛
- 胶州
- 城阳

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that they only consider administrative division boundaries to define who is a local person. If a place belongs to Qingdao administratively, then the people from there are Qingdao locals, regardless of specific districts like Jiaozhou or Chengyang. The author acknowledges past perceptions based on inconvenience of transportation but now considers the entire administrative area as local due to improved transit.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author clearly uses administrative boundaries as the standard for defining local identity.
- Mentions ""行政区域划分"" (administrative division) and ""属于青岛那就是青岛人"" (if it belongs to Qingdao, then they are Qingdao people).
- The discussion about transportation is just to explain why the perception might have changed, not a standard for local identity.
- Therefore, this matches Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

- 莱西 and 平度: The author says they are on par with 青岛 only in terms of ""口音"" (accent).
- Other aspects: There are differences compared to 青岛.
- 胶州: At least has metro and airport.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- ""口音"" as a standard for comparing localness indicates Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4).
- Mentioning metro and airport as advantages is about infrastructure but the author does not explicitly or implicitly say this defines local person identity or localness, rather it is about differences between places. The author says other aspects differ but does not say these define ""local person"" identity. So RL5 is not strongly endorsed as a local identity standard.
- The focus on ""口音"" as the only parity point suggests the author endorses accent as a criterion for localness.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author states that the city proper of Qingdao includes 市南, 市北 (but not beyond 北岭水清沟), and 崂山 (but not beyond 金家岭).
- The author, a native (""土生土长"") of Qingdao, identifies with this spatial definition of the city.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses a vernacular spatial authority logic to define the core ""city"" area of Qingdao, distinguishing specific subregions and natural boundaries to demarcate the ""real"" city.
- This is not based on administrative boundaries but on habitual local understanding of the city scope.
- The author also implies local rootedness (""土生土长""), but this is a self-description and not explicitly used as a standard to define ""local person"" identity in this text.
- No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness as a criterion, linguistic-cultural criteria, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 2: The author mentions that 崂山区 has the highest housing prices but 市南区 looks down on 崂山区 as being ""乡下"" (countryside), implying a social distinction or stereotype between these areas. The author wonders if this is similar to the division between 浦西 and 浦东.  
Step 3: Analysis of recognition logic:  
- The author is discussing how 市南区 and 崂山区 are perceived in terms of local identity or status.  
- 崂山区 is described as newer urban construction but is looked down upon as ""乡下"" by 市南区, indicating a spatial and symbolic boundary recognized by locals.  
- The author implies that these intra-city spatial perceptions (newer vs. older areas, prestige differences) reflect a kind of local identity boundary or social recognition of local areas, akin to vernacular spatial authority.  
- There is no mention of administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, or occupation as identity criteria here.  
- Although house prices are mentioned, the author does not use this as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity but rather describes a social perception.  
Therefore, the main recognition logic expressed is RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority.  
Step 4: Output the result.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author identifies as a native (土生土长) of Qingdao Shinan District.
- The author questions the ""鄙视链"" (disdain hierarchy) related to local identity.
- The author states that many older people in the city district have relatives from Jiaonan and Jiaozhou, who only moved into the city from the grandparent generation.
- The author notes that county-level cities outperform urban schools in college entrance exam rates, partially due to less competitive schools and more students going abroad.
- The author acknowledges that county-level cities have many famous enterprises.
- The author recalls that Hongkong Road was a collection of small villages when they were in kindergarten.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:

- The author emphasizes family roots, noting that many city district people have family origins in surrounding county-level cities and that their grandparents moved into the city. This supports RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author implicitly challenges spatial disdain hierarchies (鄙视链) that separate city district people from county-level city people, by highlighting family ties and shared history, suggesting a broader local identity beyond administrative or spatial distinctions. This relates to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author mentions the historical transformation of Hongkong Road from villages to urban area, implying a shared local history and identity beyond current urban boundaries. This also supports RL1.
- The author discusses education and economic performance of county-level cities but does not explicitly or implicitly use these as criteria for defining who is a local person. So RL5 (Functional Livability) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness) are not clearly used as identity standards.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, dialect, occupational typification, or social embeddedness as identity criteria.

- 济南: The author is from Jinan and currently lives there; teaches the daughter to say she is from Jinan but her ancestral home is Pingdu.
- 青岛: The father often calls himself a Qingdao person but is laughed at by real Qingdao people.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the daughter's hukou location (户口就是平度的), linking local identity to official household registration. This is RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.
- The father is described as 土生土长平度人 (""born and bred in Pingdu""), indicating family rootedness. This is RL3: Family Rootedness.
- The father calling himself Qingdao person but being laughed at by Qingdao locals implies a social recognition based on vernacular or cultural identity boundaries; however, the author does not explicitly endorse Qingdao as his local identity, but the laughter from Qingdao people shows the vernacular social boundary. The author resists calling the daughter Qingdao person and insists on Jinan and Pingdu. So the author uses family rootedness and hukou as identity criteria, not Qingdao local vernacular acceptance.
- The author teaches the daughter to say she is Jinan person but ancestral home is Pingdu, indicating recognition of family roots and current living place.
- No explicit mention of dialect or accent (RL4), social embeddedness (RL6), livability (RL5), occupational typification (RL7), or vernacular spatial authority (RL1).

- The author explains a ""鄙视链"" (disdain hierarchy) formed due to living environment and infrastructure differences between 市南区 and other districts.
- The author attributes the disdain hierarchy to material living conditions and convenience of transportation and environment.
- The author does not explicitly say these are standards to define ""local person"" identity, but implies that the spatial differences and living conditions create social distinctions.
- This fits Recognition Logic 5 (Functional Livability), as the author uses living environment and convenience to evaluate areas.
- No explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types.
- The author does not explicitly say that living in 市南区 or other districts defines ""local person,"" but the mention of disdain hierarchy linked to living environment implies an evaluation standard related to livability.

- 市南 (Shinan District)
- 崂山 (Laoshan District)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 市南: Initially not considered prosperous or convenient; after redevelopment and reconstruction, it became very superior, with better new facilities than before.
- 崂山: Compared to the current state of Shinan, implying it is similarly prosperous or convenient.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates 市南 and 崂山 based on their material infrastructure, convenience, and facilities.
- The focus is on livability and quality of urban functions (redevelopment, new supporting facilities).
- This corresponds to RL5: Functional Livability.

青岛鄙视链的陋习延续这么多年了..还是没有任何改变...曾经的老西镇看谁都是老巴子.. 到老台东看谁都很土..不洋气.. 直到市南辛家庄拆迁改造后开始看不起一切众生了... 从前的老青岛人只承认市内四区（市南>市北>四方>李沧）崂山区都被排除在外的... 更何况七区五市之外的了..所谓土生土长的青岛人..真觉得这个陋习什么时候能改变？,Output: RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 青岛, 老西镇, 老巴子, 老台东, 市南辛家庄, 市内四区（市南, 市北, 四方, 李沧）, 崂山区, 七区五市

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 老西镇: people there looked down on others as 老巴子 (a local label)
- 老台东: people there looked down on others as 土, 不洋气
- 市南辛家庄: after redevelopment, started looking down on all others
- 市内四区（市南>市北>四方>李沧）: only these four districts are recognized by old locals as authentic local areas
- 崂山区: excluded from being considered local
- 七区五市之外: even more excluded

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author describes a spatial hierarchy and the recognition of ""local person"" identity based on intra-city spatial categories (districts), and the exclusion or inclusion of areas in the local identity.
- The author notes that ""old Qingdao people"" only recognized the four central districts as local, excluding other districts and surrounding cities.
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic, where the boundaries of ""local"" are defined by shared, habitual local perceptions of spatial identity and social status.
- There is no mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy as a basis.
- There is no mention of family rootedness or linguistic-cultural criteria.
- The focus is on spatial identity and social recognition of areas within the city.

因为他们的地区名就是带市，平度市，通常他们说山东省平度市，但是归属青岛市。 但是出去的话就会说是青岛了。,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 平度市 (Pingdu City)
- 山东省 (Shandong Province)
- 青岛市 (Qingdao City)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author explains that the area called Pingdu City is officially under Qingdao City. Locally, people say ""Shandong Province Pingdu City,"" but when going outside, they say ""Qingdao."" This reflects a local understanding of area identity and how people classify their belonging.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author is describing how local people perceive and express their spatial identity, differentiating between administrative naming and local usage. This is about shared, habitual, or culturally embedded spatial categorization, which corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

No mention of hukou, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is made. The focus is on local spatial identity perception.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author notes that some Pingdu people have a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The discussion is about people's sense of belonging or identity affiliation with a city.
- The author is highlighting the difference in identity recognition among people from Pingdu, associating their local identity more with Weifang than Qingdao.
- This relates to the spatial/cognitive/emotional perception of belonging to a city or area, not necessarily administrative legitimacy (although Pingdu is under Weifang administratively, that is implicit).
- The focus is on perceived belonging or local identity linked to spatial authority and emotional mapping.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic category:

- 青岛 (Qingdao)
- 平度 (Pingdu)
- 李沧 (Licang)
- 城阳 (Chengyang)
- 市北 (Shibei)
- 李村 (Licun)
- 崂山 (Laoshan)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
The author states they were born and raised in Qingdao for 25 years, originally from Pingdu, grew up in Licang, parents moved to Chengyang, worked and lived in Shibei, currently living in Licun, company in Laoshan. The author expresses confusion about the so-called ""Qingdao city district disdain chain"" and ""city people looking down on others"" or ""exclusion,"" saying they have not felt any such discrimination.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author identifies themselves as a local based on being ""土生土长"" (born and raised) in Qingdao for 25 years, indicating a RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) standard.
- The author mentions multiple districts within Qingdao (Licang, Chengyang, Shibei, Licun, Laoshan) but does not explicitly or implicitly endorse any intra-city spatial hierarchy or symbolic spatial distinctions. Instead, the author questions the existence of such a ""鄙视链"" (disdain chain).
- There is no appeal to administrative legitimacy (hukou or legal status) in the text.
- No mention of dialect or linguistic-cultural criteria.
- No mention of livability or functional convenience standards.
- No mention of social embeddedness or property ownership.
- No mention of occupational typification.

Therefore, the only recognition logic clearly endorsed is RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) by emphasizing ""土生土长二十五年"" and the family origin in Pingdu.

- 青岛 (Qingdao)
- 市南区 (Shinan District)
- 李沧 (Licang)
- 崂山 (Laoshan)
- 莱西 (Laixi)
- 平度 (Pingdu)
- 小岛岛 (a local nickname for Qingdao)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The person moved from outside to Qingdao and lives in Shinan District.
- This person thinks highly of themselves, calling Licang an ""urban-rural fringe,"" saying Laoshan is full of relocated residents, and Laixi and Pingdu are remote mountainous areas.
- The author claims that genuine locals only feel ""my little island"" (Qingdao) is good everywhere and love it most.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The person who moved in uses spatial distinctions within Qingdao (Licang as fringe, Laoshan as relocated residents area, Laixi and Pingdu as remote) to assert a hierarchy of localness or prestige.
- The author implicitly endorses a local identity based on a vernacular spatial authority (RL1): the classification of districts into core local or less local areas based on common social perceptions.
- The author contrasts this with ""青岛土生土长本地人"" (Qingdao born and raised locals), which suggests a family rootedness logic (RL3) is also recognized.
- The emphasis on ""土生土长"" (native born and raised) indicates RL3.
- The derogatory spatial labels (城乡结合部, 拆迁户, 偏远山区) are examples of vernacular spatial authority (RL1).
- The author values the entire island as good, which is a collective emotional map and local identity boundary (RL1).

我李村的，我一个胶州的同事，住在市南租房子，他说我李村不属于市区，笑死人了，后面我才知道他是胶州的。给我拽上了还。,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 李村 (Li Village)  
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)  
- 市南 (Shinan District)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 李村: The author claims ""我李村的"" (I am from Li Village), asserting a local identity.  
- 市南: The colleague lives in Shinan District renting a house and says ""李村不属于市区"" (Li Village is not part of the urban area).  
- 胶州: The colleague is from Jiaozhou, which the author reveals later.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The colleague's statement that Li Village is not part of the urban area implies a logic about spatial boundaries and what counts as ""city area"" or ""local area."" The author reacts to this by emphasizing their own local identity from Li Village, implicitly challenging the colleague's spatial boundary definition. This relates to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it involves defining ""local"" based on perceived spatial boundaries rather than official administrative status.  
- The author also implies that the colleague, being from Jiaozhou, is an outsider, which supports the spatial boundary and local identity logic.  

No mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy, so no RL2.  
No mention of family rootedness or generational history, so no RL3.  
No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic features, so no RL4.  
No mention of livability, amenities, or environment, so no RL5.  
No mention of social embeddedness or property, so no RL6.  
No mention of occupational typification, so no RL7.

Step 2: The author states ""李村属于即墨方言"" which implies that the area 李村 is classified by the dialect spoken, 即墨方言.  
Step 3: This is a linguistic-cultural classification standard, using dialect as a boundary marker to define local identity. The author implicitly endorses the use of dialect (即墨方言) to categorize 李村 as local.  
Step 4: Output the corresponding recognition logic category label.

我潍坊人，平度以前属于潍坊过，所以现在还有一些老一辈平度人的对潍坊归属感比青岛强,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 潍坊 (Weifang)
- 平度 (Pingdu)
- 青岛 (Qingdao)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that Pingdu used to belong to Weifang, so some older generation Pingdu people feel a stronger sense of belonging to Weifang than to Qingdao.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses historical administrative boundaries or past jurisdiction (""平度以前属于潍坊过"") as a basis for the identity or belonging sense.
- This aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), because the sense of belonging is linked to administrative affiliation.
- Also, the mention of ""老一辈平度人的归属感"" suggests a generational or family rootedness aspect, but the author only mentions the older generation's feeling; no explicit claim about family roots or lineage is made as a standard.
- Therefore, primarily RL2 is applicable.

- 烟台 (Yantai)
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)
- 市区 (urban area of the city)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author is originally from the city (南土生土长), went to Yantai for school, then returned and married a man from Jiaozhou, now living in Jiaozhou for the child's schooling.
- The author has multiple properties in the city center, Jiaozhou, and Chengyang.
- The author's parents live in Laoshan.
- Neighbors say the author has ""finally moved from the village into the city.""
- Someone once asked if the author cannot get a house with heating in Jiaozhou.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions ""南土生土长"" (born and raised locally), indicating RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The mention of owning multiple properties in various districts and parents living in Laoshan implies social embeddedness and property ownership as markers of identity or local status, which relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The neighbors' comment ""finally moved from the village into the city"" implies a spatial boundary and social recognition of local identity based on place type (village vs city), which reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The question about having heating in Jiaozhou hints at functional living conditions but the author dismisses it and does not endorse it as a standard for local identity, so RL5 is not strongly supported.
- No mention of administrative status or hukou, dialect, or occupational typification.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 即墨: The author identifies as from 即墨 and believes 即墨话 is ""very noble"" and ""authentic"" local dialect.
- 新青岛话地区: The author describes this dialect area as formed by the fusion of immigrant dialects and local dialects.
- 青岛 (including 崂山, 城阳, 李村, 平度南): The author claims 即墨话 (including these places) is the authentic native dialect of 青岛.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses dialect authenticity and purity as the main criterion for defining who is a ""local person"" or ""authentic native"" of 青岛.
- This matches Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), because the author emphasizes the dialect (即墨话) as the true local dialect, and distinguishes it from ""new Qingdao dialect"" formed by immigrant populations.
- The author implicitly endorses dialect as a boundary marker for local identity.

- 作者指出自己在青岛吃饭、买菜、坐出租车，实际生活中被认可和接纳。

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The auntie uses a spatial boundary logic (黄岛不算青岛核心区) to exclude the author, which reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority). But this is an opposing logic, the author does not endorse this.
- The author states that having property (房子) in 黄岛 is just an object, so property ownership is not a standard they endorse for local identity. So no RL6.
- The author emphasizes their own effort to work, settle down, build social circles and life in Qingdao. This reflects RL6 (Social Embeddedness), since the author links local identity to integration into local social networks and life.
- The author denies needing ancestral lineage (渔民的后代) recognition, so rejects RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author does not mention dialect or language, so no RL4.

- 即墨邑 (ancient Jimo settlement)
- 隋朝 (Sui Dynasty)
- 清末 (late Qing Dynasty)
- 即墨县 (Jimo County)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author claims that ""土著是即墨人"" (the natives are Jimo people), defining ""local person"" as someone from the historical Jimo area.
- The author excludes areas like Pingdu, Laixi, Jiaozhou, Huangdao from the Jimo local area.
- The author defines the Jimo local area based on the historical administrative entity ""Jimo County"" from the Sui Dynasty to late Qing Dynasty.
- The author emphasizes cultural, linguistic, and customary unity (""人文方言文化习俗统一"") during that historical period.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the historical administrative boundaries and historical cultural unity as the basis for defining ""local person.""
- The emphasis on the historical county (Jimo County) from Sui to Qing is an appeal to administrative legitimacy over time.
- The mention of cultural, linguistic, and customary unity suggests a vernacular spatial authority logic, as the author distinguishes the area based on a historically sedimented local identity and cultural homogeneity.
- However, the main logic is based on the historical administrative unit (即墨县) and its cultural-linguistic unity, so RL1 and RL2 are both applicable.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 城阳舍友 says 胶州不属于青岛 because 胶州没划为区 (Jiaozhou is not part of Qingdao because it is not designated as a district).
- 胶州舍友 says 城阳啥啥都没有 (Chengyang has nothing).
- 胶南 and 即墨 were designated as districts.
- 胶州舍友 is upset that 胶南 is poor but was made a district, while 胶州 was not.
- 城阳舍友 wants to find a boyfriend from 市南 or 市北.
- 城阳舍友 dislikes a 黄岛 male student despite him being nice.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The dispute about whether 胶州 belongs to 青岛 based on district designation relates to **Administrative Legitimacy (RL2)**.
- The emotional or identity-based dispute between the two roommates about which area counts as local or better, especially the mention of 胶南 being poor but still being a district, and the desire for a boyfriend from 市南 or 市北, hints at **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**, as it reflects local perceptions of area status and identity beyond just administrative boundaries.
- The dislike of the 黄岛 boy by the 城阳舍友 because he is from 黄岛 also indicates the use of spatial identity to judge social relations, further supporting RL1.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to entities:
- The husband claims he is from 黄岛 and refuses to acknowledge any relation with 青岛.
- The author initially believed 黄岛 was an independent place, unrelated to 青岛.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The husband’s claim and refusal to associate 黄岛 with 青岛 indicates a viewpoint about spatial boundaries and the identity of local areas.
- This is about the definition of local identity based on intra-city spatial categories and their recognition or denial.
- The author’s understanding about 黄岛 and 青岛 relates to local perceptions of city area boundaries.
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 2: The author points out that although 胶东机场 is far from the city center, people in the city center often mention 潍坊机场 as if it belongs to their city. The author sarcastically suggests that by such logic, 胶州 is being considered part of 潍坊.

Step 3: The author is discussing the spatial boundaries and which areas belong to which city or district, implicitly questioning or criticizing the local spatial recognition or classification logic.

- 青岛 (Qingdao)
- 市南 (Shinan)
- 市北 (Shibei)
- 李沧 (Licang)
- 黄岛 (Huangdao)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author says the ""鄙视链"" (contempt chain) existed among the older generation because of the transportation underdevelopment in Qingdao.
- Only Shinan and Shibei had many residents.
- Licang and Huangdao were more rural with farming.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author indicates that the older generation viewed people from Shinan and Shibei differently from those in Licang and Huangdao based on historical living conditions and urban/rural distinctions.
- This is about spatial distinctions within the city based on historical settlement and urban/rural character.
- The contempt chain is related to intra-city spatial categories and historical perceptions, not administrative divisions or hukou.
- This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it reflects local habitual perceptions of spatial categories and symbolic meanings of areas (urban vs rural, central vs peripheral).
- The author does not mention family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupation, or functional livability as defining standards.
- No explicit mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy.
- Therefore, only RL1 applies.

Similarly, the author thought 寿光 was not part of 潍坊, 诸暨 not related to 绍兴, 余姚 not related to 宁波. The author notes that these perceptions are based on everyday language and do not involve discrimination but cause fuzzy boundaries.

Step 3: The author discusses local identity based on habitual or commonly held perceptions about which areas count as part of a city or not, reflecting a shared local cognitive map or vernacular spatial boundary. This fits Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

No mention or endorsement of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards for defining local identity.

- 青岛: The author is an outsider living in Qingdao for over ten years. The author observes that Qingdao people do not explicitly show regional discrimination in daily life, but in some conversations, there is implicit regional division and a sense of superiority of the main urban area.
- 沧口曼儿 and 城阳: These are mentioned as examples of areas specifically referred to in conversations that reflect local spatial distinctions or regional identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author describes the existence of local intra-city spatial categories and a collective emotional map that distinguishes areas like Cangkou Man'er and Chengyang from the main urban areas, which carry a sense of superiority or identity differentiation.
- The author mentions local dialect/accent (""青岛话的口音"") as a marker used to ask about someone's district, implying linguistic-cultural recognition.
- The author notes that people ask ""你家哪个区的"" (which district your family is from), indicating the importance of spatial identity.
- The author does not explicitly oppose these standards but recognizes their presence in social discourse.

Step 4: Output the results:
The author acknowledges the use of:
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): regional distinctions within Qingdao city and the associated superiority of main urban areas.
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): use of Qingdao dialect accent as a marker of local identity.

谢谢小姐姐，前几天看到过你这条评论，当时就很有感触，我是土生土长平度人，具体点是平度南村人，高中搬家到一中附近，我一直觉得平度超级好，四季分明，农产品虽赶不上寿光，可是从小过完年爸妈会带我去路边买草莓，五月份去云山过樱桃节，夏天有时吃明村西瓜有时吃东王府庄的人开着三轮车走街串巷卖的西瓜，秋天必定要吃大泽山葡萄，配上八月十五的烧鸡，冬天仁兆白菜和古岘芹菜堆满整个过洞…长大以后走过很多地方才发现平度没有一个大型综合性商超，也没有什么高新产业经济带，甚至现在连财政都岌岌可危，但我还是会想念南村街里的水果摊烧饼铺，想念平度温州路汽修厂的油条，想念小时候妈妈去平度办事绕到帝王给我带回一盒新出的肯德基蛋挞,Recognition Logic 3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:

- Describes local seasonal agricultural products and local customs, expressing deep attachment to these local things.
- Notes that Pingdu lacks large supermarkets, high-tech industries, and is financially struggling.
- Despite economic shortcomings, the author still feels nostalgic for local streets, local food stalls, and local experiences.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author identifies as a local based on being ""土生土长"" (born and raised), emphasizing personal growth history and family rootedness.
- The detailed mention of local seasonal fruits, local street vendors, and specific local food suggests cultural embeddedness and local lifestyle, but the focus is more on personal experience than dialect or language.
- No mention of administrative boundaries or hukou.
- No direct mention of dialect or accent.
- No mention of property, social connections, or occupational groups.
- The author notes the lack of economic development but does not use it as a criterion for defining local identity, only as background.
- The strong emphasis on being born and raised in Pingdu and the emotional attachment to local customs and places indicates Recognition Logic 3 (Family Rootedness).

"“城阳不算青岛…”最近山东的小伙伴可能都刷到了这个视频，青岛大姨把城阳黄岛即墨胶州莱西平度开除岛籍，到底哪才是青岛呢？
 🛡️叠甲：坚决反对一切地域歧视和地图炮言行🙅
 🧒本人：家庭来自江苏常州多年在青岛上学工作（市南区实验-市实验初中-青岛二中）
 1.“算不算青岛”本质是一个“城 郊 对立”的说法，行政上各区市都属于青岛，但主城区的大姨群体不认同其他区市的人是“青岛人”
 2.【教育体系的隔离】多年以来城阳黄岛莱西等区市的学生，都无法报考市属重点高中（2 58 1 9），10年前崂山的学生仅有部分能报考（这也是崂山以前被开除岛籍的原因），至今城阳黄岛等区的学生也无法派位局属初中（实验 26 39 ），教育资源分布不均问题仍未解决。
  
 3.【方言口音的差异】主城区居民多是移民，更接近普通话，且有部分外语舶来词，这也是大姨们优越感的来源之一，城阳、黄岛（胶南）即墨本地人居多，口音和词汇更具地方性历史性。
 4.【道路交通的隔离】至今青岛主城区通往各区市的最便捷路线都需要交费：黄岛-海底隧道、城阳-青银高速、即墨平度莱西-青新龙青高速、胶州-跨海大桥，这在大型城市中是比较少见的人为隔离，导致产生了“进城”要交钱的优越心理，也增加了跨区通勤的成本。【再次呼吁海底隧道免费！】
  
 5. 【皈依者狂热】这一心理现象多出现在受过殖民影响的地区，主城区的移民们觉得自己继承老德意志正黑旗的衣钵，靠着优越感和歧视来构建区域居民认同。同样的病态心理也出现在部分上海、香港等地居民。
 6.【发展不均衡】抛去gdp这种和普通人关系不大的数据不谈，各区人均可支配收入基本符合“开除岛籍”视频中的描述，主城区包揽前几名（2022年度数据）。
  
 7.【被歧视、凝视者的反击】很多在主城区求学、工作的人都在租房、挤地铁公交的过程中遭受过大姨们的嘲讽、歧视、冒犯，互联网玩梗，既是消遣也是反击。
 【综上所述】“不算青岛”本身就是没有上海香港的命得了上海香港的病。一个歧视他人的人不会有大出息，一个排外甚至排内的城市不会有大发展。研究哪个区算青岛，不如研究如何促进教育公平、经济发展、交通畅通。","RL1, RL4","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 城阳 (Chengyang)  
- 青岛 (Qingdao)  
- 黄岛 (Huangdao)  
- 即墨 (Jimo)  
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)  
- 莱西 (Laixi)  
- 市南区 (Shinan District)  
- 崂山 (Laoshan)  
- 上海 (Shanghai)  
- 香港 (Hong Kong)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 城阳, 黄岛, 即墨, 胶州, 莱西: These are districts or county-level cities under Qingdao’s administration but are viewed by some ""main city"" residents as ""not really Qingdao,"" reflecting a ""city vs suburb"" opposition.  
- 青岛: The core city districts are seen as ""real"" Qingdao by the ""aunties"" (local elders), while other districts are excluded from this local identity by them.  
- 市南区: The author studied and worked here, indicating personal ties to the core city.  
- 崂山: Previously partially excluded from ""Qingdao island"" identity, due to similar administrative or cultural distinctions.  
- 上海 and 香港: Mentioned for comparison regarding similar exclusionary or regionalist identity issues.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
1. The main opposition ""算不算青岛"" (whether counted as Qingdao) is essentially a ""city vs suburb"" dichotomy. Although all districts belong administratively to Qingdao, the core urban residents (main city aunties) do not recognize other districts as truly Qingdao locals. This reflects a cognitive, habitual spatial perception distinct from official boundaries.  
=> Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority

2. Education system segregation: Students from certain districts cannot access municipal key high schools or district-level key middle schools, reflecting institutional exclusion that enforces identity boundaries. This is an institutional but not strictly administrative boundary (hukou-based) argument, but it is used socially to reinforce who is considered local.  
=> This can be interpreted as a social institutional barrier reinforcing local identity, somewhat related to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), but the author does not explicitly endorse this as a standard for defining local identity, rather describing it as exclusion. So no RL6.  
=> The author criticizes this segregation, so it is not an endorsed standard. No RL annotation here.

3. Dialect/accent differences: Core city residents speak a dialect closer to Mandarin with some foreign words; suburbs have more local dialect and historical vocabulary. This linguistic difference is a source of local superiority complex by core city residents. The author mentions this as a difference but not necessarily endorsing it as a criterion for local identity. However, the fact that the author highlights dialect differences as a key dimension of local distinction implies recognition of RL4.  
=> Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition

4. Transportation barriers: Toll roads separate the core city from suburbs, creating psychological and material ""barriers"" and a sense of superiority of the core city residents. The author calls this ""human-made segregation"" and calls for free tunnels. The author critiques this, not endorses it as a legitimate standard. No RL annotation.

5. ""皈依者狂热"" (converted zealots) phenomenon: core city immigrants claiming superiority and identity by inheritance of colonial heritage. The author critiques this as pathological psychology. Not an endorsed standard, no RL annotation.

6. Uneven development: Core city districts have higher per capita disposable income, aligning with the exclusionary ""not Qingdao"" narrative. The author notes this but dismisses GDP data as unrelated to ordinary people. The author does not endorse economic status as a standard for local identity but rather calls for development equity. No RL annotation.

7. Discrimination experienced by suburban residents in core city: The author describes discrimination but does not endorse it as a standard. No RL annotation.

Summary:  
- RL1: The author explicitly discusses the vernacular spatial division between ""core city"" and suburbs as the root of the local identity dispute.  
- RL4: The author mentions dialect and accent differences as an important dimension of local identity distinction, implicitly recognizing its role in defining local person identity.

No explicit endorsement of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as standards by the author.

Output: RL1, RL4"
你这种海归硕士去市南或者地铁溜一圈一大推大姨让你娶她曼很喜欢你这种高学历的,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 市南 (City South)  
- 地铁 (Subway)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 市南 or 地铁 area is mentioned as places where many ""aunties"" (大姨) like high-educated people such as ""you"" (the addressed person, a returnee master graduate) and want to marry them.  
- The author implies that in these areas, high education is a valued attribute and recognized by locals.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""市南"" and ""地铁"" as places where locals (大姨) appreciate and seek high-educated people implies a social embeddedness in specific urban areas. The author seems to indicate that being a high-educated person is recognized and desired by locals there, linking identity recognition to social embeddedness and status within the local social circle.  
- This suggests RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as it involves social connections and recognition based on education and social status within a community.  
- There is also a spatial element (市南 or near the subway), but the focus is on social recognition, not on defining ""local person"" by spatial boundaries.  
- The text does not mention administrative status, family roots, dialect, or occupational typification explicitly.  
- The ""high education"" and social desirability is linked to social embeddedness rather than just livability or infrastructure.  

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL6"
我是李村的，感觉可能很多人对青岛有争论可能是对“青岛”这个所谓的概念站在不同角度去理解的。仅从个人的认识来说，如果说是市的层面，我的观念感觉城阳即墨胶州西海岸都可以说是青岛，平度莱西确实是有点太远了，总感觉名义上的，我确实对那边缺少同在一个青岛的归属感。如果说是岛的层面，那我认为红岛和黄岛肯定不属于青岛，这三个应该是并列的，青岛的话我认为城阳的流亭以南，加上市内四区的范围都叫青岛。,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 李村 (Lǐcūn)
- 青岛 (Qingdao)
- 城阳 (Chengyang)
- 即墨 (Jimo)
- 胶州 (Jiaozhou)
- 西海岸 (West Coast)
- 平度 (Pingdu)
- 莱西 (Laixi)
- 红岛 (Hongdao)
- 黄岛 (Huangdao)
- 流亭 (Liuting)
- 市内四区 (Four districts within the city)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states their personal understanding of what counts as ""Qingdao"":
  - At the city administrative level (""市的层面""), the author thinks Chengyang, Jimo, Jiaozhou, West Coast all can be called Qingdao.
  - Pingdu and Laixi are ""too far"" and feel more like nominally Qingdao, the author lacks a sense of belonging with those areas.
  - At the island level (""岛的层面""), the author thinks Hongdao and Huangdao do not belong to Qingdao; these three (Hongdao, Huangdao, Qingdao) should be considered parallel.
  - For Qingdao, the author considers Chengyang's Liuting southwards and the four urban districts to be Qingdao.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses the spatial boundaries of ""Qingdao"" from two perspectives: city administrative level and island geographical level.
- The author expresses a personal perception and sense of belonging regarding the inclusion/exclusion of certain areas within ""Qingdao.""
- The distinctions are not purely administrative (the author distinguishes nominal administrative areas like Pingdu and Laixi as ""too far"" and lacking belonging), but also based on spatial and emotional or cognitive understandings of what ""Qingdao"" is.
- The author refers to ""sense of belonging,"" ""feeling,"" and ""personal recognition"" about which areas belong to Qingdao.
- This corresponds to **Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)**: The author uses local perceptions and emotional mappings to define what counts as Qingdao.
- The author also explicitly mentions ""市的层面"" (city administrative level), indicating an awareness of administrative boundaries, but the core argument is about personal sense of belonging rather than strictly hukou or legal status. So RL2 is not strongly endorsed as a defining standard.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation typification as defining standards.

Step 4: Output the results:

Output: RL1"
完蛋，我们都是郊区人,":
Output: RL1","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 郊区 (suburban area)

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The phrase ""我们都是郊区人"" (""We are all suburban people"") suggests the author defines local identity by being from the suburbs.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author identifies ""local person"" identity based on spatial belonging to a specific area type, ""郊区"" (suburban area).
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic, as the author uses a spatial category (suburbs) as a basis for local identity.
- No administrative division, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is mentioned or implied.

Step 4: Output results:
Output: RL1"
何止交通？医疗教育购物等等,RL5,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specifically mentioned.

Step 2: The text ""何止交通？医疗教育购物等等"" (""Not just transportation? Medical care, education, shopping, etc."") implies a discussion about various living functions or amenities.

Step 3: The author is emphasizing multiple functional aspects (transportation, medical care, education, shopping) that contribute to an area's quality or livability. This suggests the author uses these functional livability factors as standards for evaluating or defining a ""local"" area or local identity.

Step 4: According to the Recognition Logic framework, this corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).

Output: RL5"
乖乖，住城墙里头的是天龙人吗？讲话都这么吊了，其他都是乡下人哈哈哈,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities:
- ""城墙里头"" (inside the city walls)
- ""天龙人"" (a metaphorical term, originally from One Piece manga, meaning privileged elites)
- ""乡下人"" (country folks, rural people)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author sarcastically asks if people living inside the city walls are ""天龙人"" (privileged locals), implying that those inside the city walls speak in a lofty manner, while others are ""乡下人"" (rural outsiders).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is using the spatial location ""inside the city walls"" as a criterion to distinguish locals from outsiders.
- The term ""城墙里头"" implies a historically or culturally recognized core area, with an implied status difference.
- The mention of ""乡下人"" contrasts with those inside the city walls, reinforcing a spatial boundary as a standard.
- This fits Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author uses local spatial knowledge and symbolic boundaries to define local identity.

No evidence for other RL categories.

Output: RL1"
按以前的行政区块，至少老下关、秦淮区城墙外的部分、雨花、建邺相当于城乡结合部，2000年以前仙林大学城那边还有不少农田的,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 老下关 (Old Xiaguan)
- 秦淮区城墙外的部分 (the part outside the city wall of Qinhuai District)
- 雨花 (Yuhua)
- 建邺 (Jianye)
- 仙林大学城 (Xianlin University Town)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that according to the old administrative divisions, 老下关, the part outside the city wall of 秦淮区, 雨花, and 建邺 were equivalent to urban-rural fringe areas.
- Before 2000, 仙林大学城 still had a lot of farmland.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author refers to ""以前的行政区块"" (old administrative divisions), implying the use of administrative boundaries as a standard to categorize these areas.
- The mention of ""城乡结合部"" (urban-rural fringe) and farmland before 2000 indicates an evaluation based on historical land use and administrative status.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy) because the classification is based on administrative divisions and historical jurisdiction.
- There is no indication that the author is endorsing vernacular spatial perceptions beyond administrative boundaries, nor is there mention of family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, livability, or occupational typification as standards for defining ""local person.""
- Therefore, only RL2 applies.

Output: RL2"
以前城墙以内，现在按行政区划。如果还按照以前，南京小县城都不如了，太小。现在南京全部加一起也不大，再减就没啦,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 南京 (Nanjing), 城墙以内 (within the city wall), 行政区划 (administrative divisions)

Step 2: The author compares two standards for defining the ""local"" area of Nanjing: the old spatial concept ""within the city wall"" and the current standard ""according to administrative divisions."" The author suggests that if the old standard were used, Nanjing would be very small, even smaller than a small county town. Now, the entire Nanjing is combined administratively, and further reduction would leave nothing.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:

- The author explicitly says ""现在按行政区划"" (""Now according to administrative divisions""), indicating endorsement of administrative boundaries as the standard to define the local area.

- The mention of ""以前城墙以内"" (""previously within the city wall"") is presented as an outdated standard, implicitly rejected.

Therefore, the author endorses RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) as the standard for defining local area identity.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL2"
城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 城墙外 (outside the city wall)
- 夫子庙 (Confucius Temple)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author says ""城墙外，我小时候住那边，去夫子庙都说进城了"" which means ""Outside the city wall, I lived there when I was young, and going to Confucius Temple was considered 'going into the city'."" This reflects a shared local spatial perception about what counts as ""inside the city"" or ""local area"".

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author is referring to a common local perception of spatial boundaries and identity — whether someone or some place is ""in the city"" or ""outside the city"" based on emotional or habitual spatial understanding, not on administrative borders.
- This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author uses local habitual spatial categories to define local identity.

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL1"
以前交通不发达 所以才觉得城墙内才是主城区 比如过去的白下区的同学就很少去下关区 因为远,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- 城墙内 (inside the city wall)  
- 白下区 (Baixia District)  
- 下关区 (Xiaguan District)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:  
- The author says that previously due to poor transportation, people felt that only inside the city wall was the main urban area.  
- For example, classmates from Baixia District rarely went to Xiaguan District because it was far.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author uses historical spatial perceptions and habitual intra-city spatial boundaries (inside the city wall vs. outside) as a standard for defining the main urban area or ""local"" area. This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic, i.e., RL1.  
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as defining local identity.  

Step 4: Output the results:  
Output: Recognition Logic 1"
确实，小时候我们家住城南现在万象城那边他们都觉得瑞金路解放门好远了，就是城墙城南到城墙城东觉得好远啊那时候交通实在不便利,Recognition Logic 1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 城南 (South of the city)
- 万象城 (a commercial area)
- 瑞金路 (Ruijin Road)
- 解放门 (Jiefang Gate)
- 城墙城南 (South of the city wall)
- 城墙城东 (East of the city wall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
The author recalls that when they were young, their home was in 城南 (near 万象城). People considered 瑞金路 and 解放门 to be far away, and the distance from 城墙城南 to 城墙城东 was also considered far. The reason given is the inconvenient transportation at that time.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author is describing local perceptions of spatial distances within the city and the symbolic distance between areas (城南 vs. 城东), emphasizing how people perceived some areas as far or not part of the core local space based on habitual, lived experience and emotional mapping rather than administrative boundaries. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

No mention of hukou, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification. The focus is on perceived spatial distance and local emotional geography.

Step 4: Output the result:

Output: Recognition Logic 1"
nono 我们建邺是乡下 进城要过河过桥进城墙的,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 建邺 (Jianye)

Step 2: The author claims that 建邺 is like the countryside (""乡下""), and that to enter the city proper, one must cross a river and bridge and city wall. This implies a spatial boundary recognized by the author that defines what counts as ""in the city"" and what does not.

Step 3: The viewpoint expresses a vernacular spatial authority logic, emphasizing physical and symbolic boundaries (river, bridge, city wall) that mark the ""local"" urban area. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 4: Output the result.

Output: RL1"
小时候家里人都以城墙为界，城墙外都是郊区,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 城墙 (city wall), 郊区 (suburbs)

Step 2: The author states that in childhood, family members considered the city wall as the boundary, and anything outside the city wall was considered suburban.

Step 3: The author uses a spatial boundary based on a historical or habitual local perception (城墙 as a dividing line) to define what counts as ""local"" or ""core"" urban area versus suburban. This is a typical example of Vernacular Spatial Authority.

Step 4: Output the corresponding recognition logic category label.

Output: RL1"
跟钱有什么关系？ta说的主城区是历史沿革，优越感来自于底蕴，有底蕴不等于有钱，扯上海人做什么,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""主城区"" (main urban area), ""上海人"" (Shanghai people)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- ""主城区"" is defined based on ""历史沿革"" (historical evolution), emphasizing ""底蕴"" (cultural/historical depth) rather than wealth.
- The author rejects the idea that ""钱"" (money) or wealth is the defining factor.
- ""上海人做什么"" (what Shanghai people do) is mentioned in a dismissive tone, implying that occupation or economic status is not the defining standard.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes historical evolution and cultural depth (""底蕴"") as the basis for defining the main urban area and local identity, which aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author explicitly denies wealth (""钱"") as a defining standard, so RL5 (Functional Livability) or RL6 (Social Embeddedness) based on wealth are excluded.
- No mention of family roots, dialect, administrative legitimacy, or occupation as defining standards.

Step 4: Output the result:

Output: RL1"
肯定便利啊 仙林是宇宙的中心,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 仙林

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 仙林 is described as ""宇宙的中心"" (the center of the universe), which is a highly evaluative and symbolic spatial designation.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses a spatial metaphor (""center of the universe"") to express a strong symbolic and emotional valuation of 仙林.
- This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), where local identity is constructed by shared symbolic spatial perceptions rather than official boundaries.
- The mention of ""肯定便利"" (definitely convenient) relates to livability or convenience, but the author does not explicitly use this as a criterion for defining local person identity, more as an attribute of the place.
- Since the task focuses on identity definition standards, and ""convenience"" is mentioned, but not clearly as a criterion for local person identity, RL5 might be considered if the author uses convenience to define local identity.
- However, the text is very short, and ""肯定便利啊"" seems to be an endorsement of convenience, possibly implying that convenience is part of why 仙林 is central or local.
- Given the brevity, the strongest and clearest recognition logic is RL1.

Step 4: Output the results:

Output: RL1"
什么时候方言成为决定是否是主城区的标准了？,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities: None explicitly mentioned.

Step 2: The author questions the idea that dialect (方言) should be a criterion for deciding whether an area is a ""main urban area"" (主城区).

Step 3: The author is challenging the use of linguistic-cultural criteria (dialect) as a standard for defining a local area or identity.

Step 4: Since the author is questioning/resisting the use of dialect as a criterion, they do not endorse this standard. No other standards are mentioned or endorsed.

Output:"
行政上栖霞也是主城区，可是栖霞的边缘都到句容了，你能按行政区域划分？本地人从来不看这个,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:  
- 栖霞 (Qixia)  
- 句容 (Jurong)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- The author says that administratively, Qixia is considered part of the main urban area. However, the edges of Qixia reach Jurong, and locals do not consider administrative boundaries as the basis for defining local identity.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author explicitly rejects administrative division as the standard locals use to define ""local person.""  
- The author implies that locals rely on a more vernacular or habitual understanding of spatial boundaries rather than official administrative boundaries.  
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.  

Step 4: Output the results:

- 隧道多没有走高架看起来壮观: many tunnels, no viaducts, less spectacular.
- 新区一直都没有让外地人熟知: new areas are not well known by outsiders.
- 外地人过来大概率不会去江北河西之类的: outsiders likely do not visit Jiangbei or Hexi.
- 不像钱江世纪城和浦东之类的被人熟知: unlike Qianjiang Century City and Pudong, which are well known.
- 走走江东路江北大道双龙大道也不会觉得城市界面不好: walking along Jiangdong Road, Jiangbei Avenue, Shuanglong Avenue, the city interface is not bad.
- 老城真没什么问题，除了中山北路被地铁缠的: old city has no real problem except Zhongshan North Road is affected by subway.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author discusses which areas are considered the ""core"" or ""local"" city (老城 is the core, new areas are less known).
- The author highlights the recognition of urban areas not based on administrative boundaries but on collective perceptions of familiarity and cityscape (e.g., outsiders not knowing new areas, old city being core).
- This reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): shared local perceptions of city spatial hierarchy and identity.
- No mention of hukou or administrative divisions (RL2).
- No mention of family roots or generational history (RL3).
- No mention of dialect or language (RL4).
- The author does mention cityscape and urban interface quality (""城市界面不好""), which relates to livability and functional environment.
- This relates to RL5 (Functional Livability): evaluating areas based on cityscape and appearance.
- No mention of social embeddedness, property, or economic status (RL6).
- No mention of occupational typification (RL7).

Step 2: The author mentions seeing 河西skyline from the vantage point of 大胜关高铁 crossing the river.

Step 3: The author is describing a spatial perspective related to a specific area (河西), but there is no explicit or implicit indication that this viewpoint is used as a standard to define ""local person"" identity or to evaluate the local area as part of ""local"" identity. It is a mere spatial observation.

Step 4: No recognition logic categories apply.

我基本就是在海淀朝阳丰台活动，比较宅，从我家去公司也是走四环或者三环,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 海淀, 朝阳, 丰台, 四环, 三环

Step 2: The author mentions that they basically move around in 海淀, 朝阳, 丰台 and that from their home to company they use 四环 or 三环 ring roads.

Step 3: The author is describing their activity area and commuting route, which implies recognition of spatial boundaries or habitual local areas. The mention of specific districts and ring roads suggests an implicit acceptance of vernacular spatial authority (RL1), as the author uses these spatial markers to define their local activity scope.

No mention of administrative legitimacy (hukou etc.), family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 4: Output the result.

The author provides brief labels or descriptions for each area, often based on landmarks, social characteristics, or perceived features:
- 东城: ""美术馆，北京名胜古迹集中营"" (Art museums, concentration of Beijing famous historical sites), previously called ""秋叶原"" (Akihabara of China) for 南锣鼓巷 (Nanluoguxiang).
- 西城: ""学霸集中营"" (concentration of top students), only remembers 北京四中 (Beijing No.4 High School), 宣武印象 (Xuanwu impression) more than 西城.
- 海淀: ""修电脑的，大学集中营，去漫展喽"" (computer repair people, university concentration, go to comic conventions).
- 朝阳: ""我家，好大"" (My home, very big).
- 丰台: ""体育馆"" (stadium).
- 石景山: ""石景山游乐园，我出生的地方，老山"" (Shijingshan amusement park, my birthplace, Laoshan).
- 门头沟: ""好远……………………"" (very far).
- 房山: ""好远……………………"" (very far).

- 延庆: ""只在天气预报见过龙庆峡，没去过"" (only seen Longqing Gorge on weather forecast, never been).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:

- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority):
  The author uses colloquial, culturally shared labels to define each area, e.g., ""学霸集中营"" for 西城, ""大学集中营"" for 海淀, ""我家"" for 朝阳, ""人口密集居住地"" for 昌平. The descriptions are based on local stereotypes, social perceptions, or symbolic landmarks rather than official boundaries.
  The mention of ""以前叫通县"" for 通州 also reflects a vernacular historical identity.
  The perception of ""好远"" for 门头沟 and 房山 implies spatial cognitive mapping.
  
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition):
  The author notes ""说话带口音"" (speaks with accent) for 怀柔, 平谷, 密云, indicating a linguistic boundary recognized by the author as relevant to local identity.

- RL3 (Family Rootedness):
  The author mentions ""我家"" for 朝阳 and ""我奶奶家"" for 通州, indicating personal family roots as part of identity recognition.

No direct mention of administrative boundaries or hukou (RL2), no direct mention of property, social embeddedness, or economic status (RL6), no mention of livability or functional convenience (RL5), no occupational typification (RL7).

- 密云 (Miyun)  
- 密云水库 (Miyun Reservoir)  
- 纪念馆 (Memorial halls)  
- 镇上 (the town)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:  
- 密云 is described as having some landmarks (reservoir, memorial halls), but transportation is inconvenient (only buses, no subway).  
- The author complains about the inconvenience of traveling to places like the courier station, requiring a long bicycle ride.  
- The author compares this with Beijing, which should have subway access.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author highlights transportation convenience (lack of subway, only buses) as a negative factor when considering Miyun.  
- The author implicitly evaluates the livability or convenience of the area based on transportation infrastructure.  
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 5 (Functional Livability), where transportation convenience is used as a criterion to evaluate the area.  
- There is no explicit or implicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority related to defining a ""local person.""  
- The focus is on evaluating the livability or convenience of the area (Miyun), which may relate to standards for a ""local"" area, but not directly defining who is a local person.

Step 2: The author describes various districts with attributes: 房价贵 (high housing prices) for 东城、西城; many schools and good education in 海淀; 潮人多 and many outsiders in 朝阳; 丰台 has many good foods; 石景山 has an old amusement park; 门头沟 is not familiar; 房山、昌平、大兴、通州 are far away; 顺义 has many rich people; 怀柔 is ""Beijing's backyard garden""; 平谷 has peaches; 密云 has reservoirs; 延庆 has ice lanterns.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author describes spatial areas with symbolic or cultural attributes, e.g., ""Beijing's backyard garden"" for 怀柔, ""many rich people"" in 顺义, ""潮人多"" in 朝阳, ""high housing prices"" in 东城, 西城, which reflects collective emotional maps and symbolic meanings rather than official administrative boundaries. This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author does not mention hukou or administrative boundaries explicitly, so no RL2.
- No mention of family roots or generational ties, so no RL3.
- No mention of dialect or cultural linguistic habits, so no RL4.
- Although mentions of ""schools many, education good"" and ""房价贵"" (housing prices), these are descriptive but do not explicitly or implicitly define ""local person"" identity or local area quality as a standard. However, ""房价贵"" and ""rich people"" might imply social embeddedness or economic status as a criterion, but the author does not explicitly link this to defining ""local person"" identity. So RL6 is not clearly endorsed.
- No mention of occupational typification (RL7).
- The author describes some functional livability aspects (education, food, amusement park), but no explicit or implicit claim that these define ""local person"" identity or local area quality as a standard. So RL5 is not clearly endorsed.

Step 4: The only clearly endorsed recognition logic is RL1.

- 郊区 (suburban area)
- 市里 (urban area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 郊区: described as having good mountains and water, genuine people, slow life pace, fewer entertainment options, suitable for staying.
- 市里: many entertainment options, fast life pace, work is like a race walk, has subway full of ""human smell"".

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author contrasts suburban and urban areas mainly by lifestyle pace, environment, and amenities.
- The author highlights environmental quality (""山好水好""), social character (""人实在""), and life pace (""生活节奏慢"") for 郊区.
- For 市里, the emphasis is on availability of entertainment, fast pace, and subway convenience.
- The author implicitly uses the functional living environment and livability factors to evaluate the areas.
- No explicit or implicit statement about defining who is a local person based on these factors.
- The text does not discuss administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational types, or vernacular spatial authority.
- The text does not explicitly or implicitly use these factors as standards to define ""local person"" identity.
- Therefore, these are evaluations of living environment, not criteria for local person identity.

- 平谷: peach blossoms and picking peaches.
- 密云: author's home, inconvenient to go to city, water shortage issues.
- 延庆: far away, visited the world horticultural expo.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the description of these districts to convey the ""local"" cognitive map of Beijing's intra-city spatial categories, with their characteristic symbolic or emotional labels (e.g., ""真京爷"" for 东城/西城, ""副中心"" for 通州, ""international schools and wealthy people"" for 顺义, ""frequent flooding"" for 门头沟, etc.). This reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The author mentions ""我家"" for 密云, indicating family rootedness or birthplace; also mentions inconvenience traveling from there to the city. This may suggest RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- However, the author does not explicitly mention administrative boundaries or hukou status, so RL2 is not applicable.
- The mention of international schools and wealthy people in 顺义, or flooding in 门头沟, or amusement parks, are descriptive but do not serve as standards for defining who is a local person.
- The author does not mention dialect or accent, so RL4 is not applicable.
- The descriptions are mostly about place-based identity and emotional/cultural impressions, not about functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:

- The author describes areas with cultural, historical, and social labels (e.g., 皇城根儿, 正黄旗 for 西城; ape-man site for 房山), which implies **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.
- The author notes ""延庆: 有口音 不算北京"" (has accent, not considered Beijing), explicitly denying ""local"" status based on accent and spatial perception, indicating **RL4: Linguistic-Cultural Recognition** and **RL1: Vernacular Spatial Authority**.
- Mention of government office area in 通州 implies **RL2: Administrative Legitimacy**.
- Emphasis on students and tutoring in 海淀, reservoir environment and weekend water activities in 密云, good air in 怀柔, all relate to environmental quality and functional livability, indicating **RL5: Functional Livability**.
- The author mentions local products like watermelons in 大兴, flowers and fish in 丰台, peaches in 平谷, which are cultural markers but more related to local specialties; however, these do not clearly serve as standards for defining ""local person"" identity, more like area characteristics, so likely excluded.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The author uses descriptions of areas with subjective labels such as ""old,"" ""small,"" ""expensive,"" ""far away,"" ""villa area,"" ""trendy and wealthy people,"" ""many fun malls,"" ""nice scenery,"" ""good for vacation,"" ""many tourist traps."" These are not official administrative boundaries or hukou based, nor do they mention family roots or dialect.
- The classification is based on local perceptions and symbolic meanings attached to each area, reflecting habitual spatial categories and collective emotional maps (e.g., ""far away"" as a negative spatial marker, ""villa area"" as a social status marker, ""many tourist traps"" as a negative evaluation).
- The author implicitly endorses these spatial and social distinctions as a way to evaluate areas, which is consistent with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- Some mention of ""trendy and wealthy people"" in 朝阳 (Chaoyang) and ""villa area"" in 顺义 (Shunyi) hint at social class or occupational groupings, but the focus is more on spatial identity and social image tied to place rather than specific occupations. The author does not explicitly say these occupational types define ""local person"" identity, so RL7 is less clear.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative divisions or hukou, so RL2 is not applicable.
- No mention of family roots or dialect, so RL3 and RL4 are not applicable.
- Mentions of ""old, small, expensive housing"" and ""many tourist traps"" are more about area quality but not explicitly used as identity standards for ""local person,"" so RL5 is partially relevant but only if the author uses these to define ""local person."" Here, the author seems to use these features as part of the area's identity, which fits RL1 better.
- No mention of social embeddedness like property ownership or social networks, so RL6 is not applicable.

- 延庆 (Yanqing)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author assigns brief labels or impressions to each district, e.g., ""城里人"" (city people) for 东城 and 西城, ""很那个的地方"" (somewhat negative or ambiguous) for 海淀, ""巨大一片"" (huge area) for 朝阳, ""钢！"" (steel, likely indicating industrial or rough) for 石景山, ""城中村"" (urban village) mentioned by 石景山 people themselves, ""待富"" (waiting to become rich) for 通州, and references to schools, music festival, water reservoir, Winter Olympics, etc., for other districts.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
The author is using these labels as collective emotional or cultural shorthand to categorize areas within the city. The focus is on the social or symbolic impressions associated with each district rather than administrative boundaries or family roots. For example:  
- 东城 and 西城 are called ""城里人"" (urban locals), implying these areas are core or authentic urban areas.  
- 朝阳 is described as a ""huge area"" and ""everywhere is Chaoyang,"" indicating a perception of spatial vastness and identity.  
- 石景山 is associated with ""steel"" and ""urban village,"" which are symbolic or cultural markers.  
- 通州 is described as ""waiting to become rich,"" implying a developmental or aspirational status.  
This aligns with the concept of shared local perceptions of spatial categories and their symbolic meanings, i.e., **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**.

No mention of administrative legitimacy (hukou or legal boundaries), family rootedness, dialect, livability features, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as standards to define ""local person"" identity. The author is not using these to define ""local person"" identity but rather expressing cultural impressions of districts.

- 房山: ""周口店猿人遗址"" (archaeological site)
- 延庆: ""八达岭长城 动物园"" (Great Wall, zoo)

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The text mainly lists landmarks and some personal experience or perceptions about districts.
- Mentions of accent in 平谷: ""口音好重"" — suggests linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4).
- Mentions of ""别墅 有钱的多"" in 顺义 — indicates social embeddedness (RL6), as the presence of villas and wealthy people is linked to local identity or evaluation.
- The mention of partner studying in 门头沟 indicates some family-rootedness or personal connection, but it's only that partner studied there, no explicit or implicit claim that this defines ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of ""卷子好难 初高中折磨我6年"" in 海淀 is personal schooling experience, no identity definition.
- The listing of landmarks or areas is descriptive, but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these landmarks or administrative areas as standards for defining ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of accent in 平谷 is the only direct reference that could be a standard to identify locals.
- The mention of wealth and villas in 顺义 could be an implicit standard to evaluate the area or local identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries or hukou.
- No mention of family roots or multi-generation settlement.
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority (no evaluation of which areas count as local).

- 延庆：山区

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:

- 东城 and 西城: Mention of merging of districts and ""城里人"" (city people). The mention of merged districts and the notion of ""city people"" suggests a spatial and administrative understanding of local identity. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) as the author references intra-city spatial categories and identity linked to these areas. It also implies RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) because of the mention of district merging, which is an official administrative action.

- 海淀: ""大学很多"" (many universities), ""那边的父母鸡娃挺多的"" (parents there push their kids hard). This is describing social and cultural characteristics but does not clearly state these as criteria for local identity. The mention of ""parents pushing kids"" relates to cultural behavior but does not explicitly tie to dialect or language. So no RL4.

- 朝阳: ""感觉很有钱的样子"" (feels wealthy). This is a social status evaluation, not explicitly a local identity definition standard. No annotation.

- 丰台: ""家"" (home), ""以前是郊区"" (used to be suburb), ""附近有城里拆迁过来的"" (nearby residents relocated from city demolition), ""没啥好工作，上班地铁好多人"" (not many good jobs, many take subway to work). The emphasis on ""家"" and the mention of migration from city demolition suggests some spatial and social embeddedness. The ""家"" mention may imply family rootedness or social embeddedness, but the text does not explicitly say family roots or social network. The mention of commuting by subway and job situation is more functional livability but not explicitly linked to defining local identity. So likely RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) due to spatial and identity notions around suburb and city area.

- 石景山: ""首钢"" (Shougang steel), ""之前公司的客服部去那边打过电话"" (previous company’s customer service called there), ""不知道为啥总觉得玉渊潭在石景山"" (feeling that Yuyuantan is in Shijingshan). This is a spatial perception about the location of Yuyuantan, which is not actually in Shijingshan, indicating vernacular spatial understanding. This aligns with RL1.

- 门头沟: ""山沟"" (mountain valley), ""去年发大水很严重"" (flooded badly last year). This is a description of geography and an event, no local identity standard stated.

- 房山: ""十渡"", ""周口店北京人本人"" (Zhoukoudian, ""Beijing person myself""). The author explicitly identifies themselves as a ""Beijing person"" from Zhoukoudian (房山). This implies family rootedness or personal growth history. RL3 applies here.

- 通州: ""环球影城"", ""副中心"" (Universal Studios, sub-center). This is spatial and administrative references. The term ""副中心"" is an administrative designation. So RL2 applies.

- 顺义: ""首都机场"", ""采摘"", ""农家乐很多"" (Capital Airport, picking fruit, many farm stays). Description of area characteristics, not identity definition. No annotation.

- 昌平: ""北边太远了"", ""回龙观"" (north too far, Huilongguan). Spatial description, no identity standard stated.

- 大兴: ""亦庄"", ""西红门"", ""高米店"", ""驾照"" (several place names, driver's license). The mention of driver's license is unclear if it relates to identity. No explicit identity standard.

- 怀柔: ""没咋去过"", ""板栗"" (haven't been much, chestnuts). No identity standard.

- 平谷: ""大桃"", ""有地方口音"" (big peach, has local accent). The mention of ""地方口音"" (local accent) relates to dialect and linguistic-cultural recognition. This is RL4.

- 密云: ""水库"" (reservoir). No identity standard.

- 延庆: ""山区"" (mountain area). No identity standard.

Step 4: Output the results:

- RL1: 东城, 西城, 丰台, 石景山

- 老北京城八区 (Old Beijing's eight city districts)
- 东城 (Dongcheng)
- 西城 (Xicheng)
- 崇文 (Chongwen)
- 宣武 (Xuanwu)
- 朝阳 (Chaoyang)
- 海淀 (Haidian)

- 房山 (Fangshan)
- 大兴 (Daxing)
- 平谷 (Pinggu)
- 密云 (Miyun)
- 怀柔 (Huairou)
- 延庆 (Yanqing)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The old man distinguishes the ""city proper"" (城里) as the core districts: Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chongwen, Xuanwu.
- Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijingshan are considered ""near suburbs"" (近郊).
- The far suburbs were incorporated later and are considered far from the ""city proper.""
- The author recounts historical administrative changes: original seven city districts, incorporation of Changping, merging of districts, and expansion of Beijing's administrative boundaries.
- The old man's perception (and the author's recounting) emphasizes a historical and vernacular spatial understanding of what counts as ""inside the city"" vs. suburbs or outskirts.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The core argument is about how locals perceive and classify the city spatially, with distinctions between ""city proper,"" ""near suburbs,"" and ""far suburbs,"" based on historical and social perceptions rather than merely official administrative boundaries.
- The author records this vernacular understanding, indicating that locals (like the old man) use these spatial perceptions to define what counts as ""local"" or ""city proper.""
- The detailed administrative history supports but does not solely define the local identity; the emphasis is on common local perceptions and the symbolic meaning of these areas.

Therefore, the recognition logic primarily corresponds to:

**Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority**

- 房山 (Fangshan)
- 延庆 (Yanqing)
- 河北 (Hebei)
- 北京 (Beijing)
- 其他区县 (other districts/counties)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 房山: The author claims to be from Fangshan and references the ""房山县志"" (Fangshan County Chronicles) as clear historical evidence.
- 延庆: The author explains that Yanqing's heavy accent is because it was originally part of Hebei, temporarily administered by Hebei, and later returned to Beijing.
- 河北: Mentioned as the original administrative region for Yanqing for a few years.
- 北京: The author claims other districts have always been inherently part of Beijing.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses historical administrative boundary changes and lineage of governance to argue about the ""local"" status and origin of Yanqing and other districts.
- The emphasis on historical administrative affiliation and temporary jurisdiction strongly aligns with RL2: Administrative Legitimacy.
- The mention of accent and dialect (""延庆口音重"") and its relation to origin suggests some linguistic-cultural recognition, but the author mainly attributes the accent to administrative history, not as a direct identity marker. The author does not use dialect as a standard to define ""local person"" identity but as a historical explanation.
- The author emphasizes historical origin and administrative changes rather than family rootedness or social embeddedness.
- No mention of functional livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority beyond administrative boundaries.

- 三环外 (outside the Third Ring Road)  
- 六环 (Sixth Ring Road)  
- 城六区 (the six central urban districts: 东西海朝石丰)  
- 郊区 (suburban districts)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author insists that all 16 districts of Beijing are important and none can be omitted.  
- The author rejects the notion that areas outside the Third Ring Road are just farmland, calling that an outdated view from last century.  
- The author currently lives within the Sixth Ring Road and states that construction there is also good.  
- The author defines ""Beijing"" as including both the six core urban districts and the ten suburban districts, all equally important.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author uses the administrative division of Beijing into 16 districts (6 core + 10 suburban) as the legitimate scope of ""Beijing"" and implicitly the basis for defining who is local or what areas count as local.  
- The author explicitly disputes vernacular or traditional spatial perceptions that exclude areas outside the Third Ring Road as not really Beijing, calling that outdated.  
- The focus is on the official administrative boundaries and district count as the standard.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic categories:  
- The author endorses RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) as the basis for defining ""local"" areas of Beijing.  
- The author rejects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) that excludes outer areas, so RL1 is not endorsed.

- 金国 (Jin dynasty)
- 北京 (Beijing)
- 明代 (Ming dynasty)
- 河北 (Hebei)
- 建国 (founding of the People's Republic of China)
- 顺天府 (Shuntian Prefecture)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author discusses the timeline and territorial changes of Beijing, pointing out that the current Beijing started from the Ming dynasty.
- The author notes that during the Republic of China era (民国), the capital moved to Nanjing, and Beijing's territory was gradually divided and assigned to Hebei.
- The author states that until the founding of the PRC and subsequent administrative changes in 1958, Beijing's administrative boundaries were not as they are today.
- The author clarifies that during Ming and Qing, Shuntian Prefecture (including Beijing) had other parts still belonging to Hebei.
- The author dismisses the relevance of the Jin dynasty's Beijing to the current Beijing.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author heavily focuses on administrative changes and boundaries over time to define what counts as ""Beijing"" or ""local Beijing.""
- The argument is based on official administrative divisions, historical administrative adjustments, and jurisdictional legitimacy.
- The author explicitly uses administrative boundaries and changes as the standard to define the scope and identity of Beijing.
- There is no mention of family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, or livability features as standards.

- Other areas are ""远郊县城"" (far suburbs or county towns).
- 二环 is described as the urban-rural boundary line.
- 三环 is described as ""荒地"" (wasteland).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses spatial, habitual, and historical perceptions of city divisions and boundaries to define what counts as the city or local area.
- The delineation by ring roads and associated symbolic meanings (urban vs rural, core city vs outskirts) indicate a vernacular spatial authority logic.
- No administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification are mentioned as standards for defining ""local person.""
- The author’s narrative shows how the urban area is culturally and symbolically divided and perceived by locals, indicating RL1.

- 天安门 (Tiananmen)  
- 北京城 (Beijing city proper)  
- 郊区 (suburbs/outskirts)  
- 北京 (Beijing)  
- 中国 (China)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author describes a vernacular or common way of dividing Beijing into ""inside the city"" (东西城, 天安门叫进北京城) and ""outside the city"" (郊区). The author notes that when they were young, areas inside East and West City and Tiananmen were considered ""inside Beijing city,"" while outside these areas were called suburbs. The author notes that Beijing has developed quickly, implying that the old boundaries or vernacular spatial conceptions might have changed. The mention of foreigners still thinking China is rural suggests a contrast between past and present spatial perceptions.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The author is referring to habitual or vernacular local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories (""东西城天安门叫进北京城，出去了就都叫郊区""), which is a typical feature of RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The author does not mention administrative boundaries or hukou, so RL2 is not indicated.  
- No mention of family roots or dialect, so RL3 and RL4 are not indicated.  
- No mention of livability or convenience, so RL5 is not indicated.  
- No mention of social embeddedness or property, so RL6 is not indicated.

Output: RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 门头沟 (Mentougou)
- 城里 (the city center or urban area)
- 东边 (the east side)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- 门头沟 is described as having mostly locals, life is comfortable, environment is good, and not crowded.
- The author mentions that as a child, they thought the city center was convenient, but as they grew older, they liked going back to the east side less.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention ""本地人占大部份"" (locals occupy the majority) suggests the author identifies 门头沟 as a local area because of its population composition. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) — the author uses local perception of who counts as local based on the area.
- The description of ""生活挺惬意 环境好"" (comfortable life, good environment) and ""逛街啥的不太行"" (shopping is not so good) shows the author evaluating the livability and environment of the area, which corresponds to RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of ""小时候总觉得城里方便 年纪越大越不爱回东边了"" implies a contrast in convenience or livability between areas, again linking to RL5.
- The explicit mention that locals mostly occupy 门头沟 is a recognition of local population composition, a vernacular spatial identity standard, so RL1 applies.
- There is no mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.

Step 2: The author argues that going to Beijing means going to the core historical city area (""北京城""), not just administrative boundaries or newly incorporated areas from Hebei. The author emphasizes historical city boundaries and traditional city concepts as the basis for defining ""local"" areas.

Step 3: The author's viewpoint is based on historical and vernacular spatial perceptions of the city area, emphasizing traditional city limits and collective cultural understanding of ""Beijing city"" versus surrounding areas. This matches Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

房山柿子不行，房山最大的特产是跨区打工人,Recognition Logic 7,"Step 1: Named entities: 房山 (Fangshan)

Step 2: The author mentions 房山柿子不行 (Fangshan persimmons are no good) and 房山最大的特产是跨区打工人 (the biggest specialty of Fangshan is cross-district migrant workers). This indicates that the author identifies Fangshan primarily with the presence of migrant workers rather than its agricultural products.

Step 3: The author's statement implies a recognition logic based on occupational typification (RL7), as they define Fangshan's identity by the dominant occupational group—cross-district migrant workers.

我住西北二环外几百米，晚上七点除了几个遛弯儿的基本就没什么人了，倍儿安静，吃饭要不西直门，要不金融街西单，远点儿王府井金宝街，我老公说清清静静的也挺好。我姨住崇文门，我以前在望京上班儿，确实不如那边儿店多，周围的批发市场全关了，不合规的小店全关了基本生活没问题，购物和娱乐活动欠缺。,"RL1, RL5","Step 1: Named entities:  
- 西北二环外 (outside the Northwest Second Ring Road)  
- 西直门 (Xizhimen)  
- 金融街 (Financial Street)  
- 西单 (Xidan)  
- 王府井金宝街 (Wangfujing Jinbao Street)  
- 崇文门 (Chongwenmen)  
- 望京 (Wangjing)  

Step 2: Match arguments:  
- The author lives just outside the Northwest Second Ring Road, describes it as very quiet at night, with few people around. For dining, they go to places farther away (Xizhimen, Financial Street, Xidan, Wangfujing Jinbao Street).

- The author’s aunt lives in Chongwenmen.  
- The author previously worked in Wangjing, notes fewer shops there, many wholesale markets and unregulated shops closed, daily life is basically fine but lacks shopping and entertainment.  

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author distinguishes between areas inside and outside the Second Ring Road, implicitly endorsing the idea that being inside or outside the ring road is a meaningful spatial boundary affecting local identity or quality of life. This suggests RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).  
- The author evaluates the living environment in terms of quietness, availability of shops, entertainment, and lifestyle conveniences, linking these features to the quality of the local area. This suggests RL5 (Functional Livability).  
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification in defining local identity.  
- The author’s discussion focuses on spatial and functional aspects of local areas as relevant to local identity or quality of life.

在北京待了5，6年吧，其实一开始并不喜欢北京，到后来慢慢习惯这里，再到现在喜欢这里，举个最新鲜的例子，我爸前几天来北京玩儿住了一个多星期，他是脑梗偏瘫，二级残疾，右手右胳膊动不了，可以走路，但行动不便，右腿拐着的，每次带他出去说实话我都提心掉胆尤其上地铁（贫困家庭出行真没法次次打车，而且北京真的很堵，晕车也很难受）让我感受最深的是主动让座的都是北京大爷大妈（年轻人似乎就只有一次让座难道真的是因为上班族怨气太重了吗）而且是我爸一上车他们就看出来有问题，立马让他去座那种，我真的，心里真的万分感激，嘴里也不停的在说谢谢,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 北京 (Beijing)
- 北京大爷大妈 (Beijing elderly people)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- For Beijing: The author describes their gradual acceptance and eventual liking of Beijing over 5-6 years.
- The author recounts an experience where elderly people in Beijing proactively gave up their seats to the author's disabled father on the subway, showing kindness and consideration.
- The author contrasts the elderly people's behavior with younger people's apparent reluctance to give up seats, possibly due to work stress.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author’s focus is on the kindness and social behavior of Beijing locals, particularly elderly people, showing social embeddedness and local social norms.
- The proactive seat offering by elderly people implies a form of social recognition or embeddedness.
- However, the author does not explicitly say that this behavior defines who is a ""local person,"" but the positive social behavior is attributed to ""Beijing old people,"" which can be interpreted as a social embeddedness criterion.
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, occupational typification, or spatial boundaries.
- The text does not discuss defining ""local person"" identity explicitly, but the author implicitly praises the social embeddedness (kindness and recognition) of Beijing elderly as part of the local identity.
- Since the kindness and social behavior are linked to local elderly people and is the author's positive recognition of locals, it fits RL6: Social Embeddedness.

- 北海公园: Used as a local leisure spot accessible by bike from 西城.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author contrasts 朝阳 and 西城 mainly on the basis of convenience of living functions, environmental quality, and livability (traffic congestion, walking distance to hospital, leisure spots, no need to drive, less noise).
- The author’s return to 西城 with family and improved happiness indicates they use livability and convenience as standards to evaluate the ""local area"" quality.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority in defining ""local person"" identity.

住在朝阳，社会关系大多在翠微周边，西边的确有点土，但那是低调，不低调也不敢啊！朝阳洋气不老少，但民营经济主导，总被西边看不起，这世界总会有你看不上我，我看不上你的事儿！,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 朝阳 (Chaoyang)
- 翠微 (Cuiwei)
- 西边 (West side)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author lives in Chaoyang and has social relationships mostly around Cuiwei.
- The west side is described as ""a bit rustic"" but characterized as ""low-key.""
- Chaoyang is described as ""fashionable,"" ""not old or young,"" and ""dominated by private economy.""
- The west side looks down on Chaoyang, and vice versa, indicating mutual social evaluation.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes social relationships centered in a particular area (Cuiwei near Chaoyang), implying social embeddedness in that locale. This aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The mention of ""west side is a bit rustic"" and ""low-key"" hints at intra-city spatial perceptions but mainly as an evaluation, not clearly endorsing a spatial boundary as a local identity standard. The author does not explicitly say ""west side is not local"" or ""Chaoyang is local because..."" so RL1 is weak or absent.
- The mention of private economy dominance and social disdain from west side suggests social stratification, but no explicit occupational typification is provided, so RL7 is not clearly supported.
- No mention of hukou or administrative boundaries (RL2).
- No mention of family roots or dialect (RL3, RL4).
- No mention of livability or infrastructure (RL5).

Step 4: Output:
The author implicitly recognizes social embeddedness (RL6) as a standard for local identity (social relationships in a certain area).

- The author lives in 东二环, parents live in 东四环, works in 西四环.  
- The author feels that going to work at 西四环 is like going abroad, especially with traffic controls described as ""customs queue.""  
Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:  
- The author distinguishes areas inside the city ring roads with a symbolic spatial boundary: 东二环 and 东四环 are local residential areas, while 西四环 is felt as ""foreign,"" implying a cognitive or symbolic boundary in local identity perception.  
- This reflects a vernacular spatial authority logic, where intra-city ring roads mark local vs. non-local or core vs. peripheral areas.  
- No administrative legitimacy (hukou etc.) is mentioned.  
- No family rootedness or linguistic-cultural markers.  
- No livability or social embeddedness standards expressed as defining ""local person.""

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author compares East and West as if they are like different places (""异地一样"").
- Driving to the East is difficult.
- The author dislikes taking the subway.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implies a spatial separation or difference between East and West areas, likening them to different places, suggesting a vernacular spatial perception.
- The difficulty of travel and dislike of subway relate to livability or convenience, but the author does not explicitly say these are standards for defining who is local.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity criteria.
- The main focus is on the perceived spatial separation and the inconvenience of traveling between East and West.

Step 4: Output recognition logic:
- The comparison of East and West as ""like different places"" reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

内片确实是一坨，房价原来挺低的，房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 内片 (a certain area)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 内片: ""房价原来挺低的，房价低就有个坏处，容易滋生垃圾"" (The housing prices were originally quite low; low housing prices have a disadvantage of easily breeding garbage)

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- The author discusses housing prices (property value) and links low prices to negative consequences (garbage), but does not explicitly or implicitly state that housing prices are a standard to define who is a local person or to evaluate ""local"" identity.

- The author also calls 内片 ""一坨"" (a lump, derogatory), but this seems more like a personal evaluation of the area, not a recognition logic about ""local person"" identity.

- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.

- The discussion is about property prices and environmental quality but not explicitly about defining local identity or standards for being local.

Step 4: No RL category applies.

- Mentions that when they were young, after getting off the subway, one had to walk a long distance to get to the amusement park.
- Later, residential communities were gradually built.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author describes the historical spatial condition of an area, indicating changes in the urban environment.
- The mention of the subway and distance to the amusement park is related to convenience and livability aspects.
- The gradual building of residential communities indicates improvement in livability.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these features to define who is a ""local person"" or to evaluate ""local"" identity.
- The text mainly describes the historical development and livability aspects of the area.
- No explicit or implicit statement that these standards are used to define ""local person.""
- Therefore, no RL categories apply.

- 通州 (Tongzhou) / 通县 (Tong County)  
- 顺义 (Shunyi)  
- 延庆 (Yanqing)  
- 西直门 (Xizhimen)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
The author expresses a traditional Beijing native's perception that areas outside certain boundaries or landmarks (East beyond Dongdaqiao, West beyond Guanyuan, North beyond North Third Ring Road, South beyond Natural History Museum, Haidian beyond Zhongguancun, Fengtai considered suburban, Tongzhou as a distant place, Shunyi and Yanqing as rural or faraway) are ""rural"" or ""countryside."" This shows a spatial perception of where the ""city"" or ""local"" core lies, and what counts as ""not local"" or ""rural.""

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
The author is describing a shared, habitual local perception or cognitive map about intra-city spatial categories and their symbolic meaning (what counts as the city core vs. rural). This fits RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because the definition is based on collective emotional maps and local cognitive boundaries rather than official administrative lines.

No mention of hukou or administrative divisions as the defining standard (RL2).  
No mention of family roots or generational depth (RL3).  
No mention of dialect or cultural language features (RL4).

老北京话里的东富西贵指的是二环以里，没朝阳什么事。而且是真正的二环城圈儿里，就是地铁2号线以里。朝阳那时候还农村呢，压根不在这个老话指的范围内。,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 东富西贵 (a phrase from old Beijing dialect)
- 二环 (Second Ring Road)
- 地铁2号线 (Subway Line 2)
- 朝阳 (Chaoyang District)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author explains that the phrase ""东富西贵"" from old Beijing dialect refers specifically to the area inside the Second Ring Road, particularly inside the subway Line 2.
- The author asserts that Chaoyang was still rural at that time and was not included in the scope indicated by this phrase.
- This is an example of a vernacular, historically sedimented local perception of the city spatial categories, defining which areas count as core local areas.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses an old local phrase and historical local knowledge to define the core ""local"" area as inside the Second Ring Road and subway Line 2.
- This is a clear example of Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author is endorsing a historically sedimented, habitual local perception of spatial boundaries that define local identity.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.
- Therefore, only RL1 applies.

Output: RL1"
正解，老辈区的概念不强的，因为那个时候变化太多，可能他经历了好几次行政区的划分调动，所以基本上本地人只会说自己待的这个地方的地名，比如凤山门望江门四牌楼庆春孩儿巷武林门半道红卖鱼桥古荡三里亭这种，也就是现在的街道（镇）、小区（村）的概念，只有对外地的朋友，他不清楚这些地方的所以才会用区来表述。,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned include 老辈区 (older generation districts), 凤山门, 望江门, 四牌楼, 庆春, 孩儿巷, 武林门, 半道红, 卖鱼桥, 古荡, 三里亭 — all place names, mostly street-level or neighborhood-level designations.

Step 2: The author states that the concept of 老辈区 is not strong because of frequent administrative changes. Locals only refer to the specific place names (streets, neighborhoods, small communities) they live in, rather than broader district names. Only when talking to outsiders do they use district-level terms because outsiders are not familiar with the smaller place names.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:

- The author emphasizes that locals identify themselves with specific local place names (streets, neighborhoods) rather than administrative districts. This highlights a shared, habitual, local perception of spatial categories at a fine-grained level, reflecting a vernacular spatial authority that is not based on official administrative boundaries.

- The mention that locals use these names as cultural shorthand for self-identification and only resort to district names for outsiders implies the importance of collective emotional maps and local spatial cognition.

- Although administrative changes are mentioned, the author points out that locals do not rely on these administrative divisions for self-identity, but rather on vernacular place names.

Therefore, the primary recognition logic reflected is RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 4: Output the results.

小时候不理解为什么老是说自己是老余杭的都是说去杭州玩，直到在杭州读大学被本地的几个人骂了一顿说我市区没房子不要说自己是杭州人之后我就有点理解了（当时只是报名后刚刚好一起去吃饭然后聊天聊起是那里人，我说我杭州的，然后细问知道我是余杭的后，就说我乡下人不要硬贴说自己是杭州人），只说自己杭州郊区或者直接说老余杭的,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned are ""老余杭"" (Old Yuhang), ""杭州"" (Hangzhou), and ""市区"" (urban area of the city).

Step 2: The author recounts an experience where local people from Hangzhou's urban area criticized the author for claiming to be from Hangzhou when they are actually from Yuhang (a suburban or formerly rural district). The criticism focused on the author's lack of property (""市区没房子"") and the fact that Yuhang is considered a ""乡下"" (countryside). The author notes that after this incident, they only say ""杭州郊区"" (Hangzhou suburbs) or ""老余杭"" (Old Yuhang).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:

- The criticism was about the author's residence in a suburban/rural area vs. the urban core, implying a distinction based on intra-city spatial boundaries and the symbolic meaning of these areas. This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority): the local people use habitual spatial categories (""urban area"" vs. ""countryside"") to define who is a ""real"" Hangzhou person.

- The mention of ""市区没房子"" (no house in urban area) is more about property and social status but the author does not endorse this as a criterion themselves; it was used by others to exclude them. So RL6 is not endorsed by the author.

- No mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy.

- No mention of family roots.

- No mention of dialect or accent.

- No mention of livability or functional convenience.

- No mention of occupational typification.

Thus, the author implicitly agrees with RL1: the local identity is linked to spatial-cultural boundaries within the city.

真的是这样，我也是余杭的，一直都说是“去杭州”，而不是去“市区”，说实在的，我们没归属感，人家也不当我们是自己人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 余杭 (Yuhang), 杭州 (Hangzhou), 市区 (urban area/downtown)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says ""我也是余杭的"" (I am also from Yuhang), and ""一直都说是‘去杭州’，而不是去‘市区’"" (we always say 'go to Hangzhou' rather than 'go to downtown'). This implies that the author distinguishes between Yuhang and the central urban area of Hangzhou.
- The author expresses ""没归属感"" (no sense of belonging), and ""人家也不当我们是自己人"" (others don't regard us as their own people), implying that the author feels excluded from the core urban identity.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author implicitly endorses a vernacular spatial authority (RL1) logic by distinguishing Yuhang from the ""市区"" (urban core), indicating that the definition of who is ""local"" depends on intra-city spatial perceptions and emotional boundaries.
- The author's lack of belonging suggests that being from Yuhang is considered less ""local"" compared to being from the urban core, reflecting the local shared cognitive map of city boundaries.

No explicit mention or implication of administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), functional livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).

Output: RL1"
什么叫乡下？你的定义是什么？周边也一大把出生就是城镇户口，父母都是工人或者事业单位公务员，家里没有土地，怎么就是乡下了？要你这么说全国就没有几个不是乡下的地方了。,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""乡下"" (countryside), ""周边"" (surrounding areas).

Step 2: The author questions the definition of ""乡下"" and challenges the idea that people born in towns with urban hukou and parents who are workers or civil servants, without land, would be considered ""乡下."" The author implies that such a definition is unreasonable and that by such a standard, almost no place in the country would not be considered countryside.

Step 3: The author focuses on the official status of hukou (""城镇户口"" - urban hukou), parents' occupations (workers or civil servants), and absence of land ownership to argue against a simplistic classification of ""乡下."" This suggests that the author considers **administrative legitimacy (hukou status)** and possibly **family social status (parents' occupations)** as relevant standards. However, the author does not endorse using parents' occupations as a standard; rather, they use it to argue that people with urban hukou and parents as workers or civil servants should not be considered ""乡下.""

Therefore, the author implicitly endorses RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) as a standard for defining ""local"" or urban identity, since they emphasize ""城镇户口"" (urban hukou) as a key factor in rejecting the ""乡下"" label.

The mention of parents' occupations is to argue against a stereotype, not to define ""local person"" identity, so RL7 is not endorsed.

No other recognition logic is clearly endorsed.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic category labels.

一样去杭州读个破大学反而还被歧视乡下人了，余杭读了12年书一点事都没有，天天说我们没归属感，那边又歧视我们，说我们乡下人，硬贴杭州，老底子杭州屁大点地方，吞了多少才发展起来自己没点数,RL3,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)  
- 余杭 (Yuhang)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 杭州: The author feels discriminated against as a ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin) when attending a university there. The author also mentions that ""老底子杭州"" (old-stock Hangzhou people) have a small place but have developed it and have some sense of ownership or legitimacy.  
- 余杭: The author attended school in Yuhang for 12 years without issue, implying that they were accepted as local there.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author contrasts ""老底子杭州"" (old-stock Hangzhou people) with newcomers or people from outside, emphasizing historical roots and generational depth as the basis for legitimate local identity. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The mention of being labeled ""乡下人"" (country bumpkin) and the conflict over ""归属感"" (sense of belonging) indicates the author perceives local identity as tied to deep roots rather than mere current presence or administrative status.  
- The critique that ""老底子杭州"" have a small place but have developed it and have ""没点数"" (no sense of their own legitimacy) suggests the author endorses the idea that local identity is grounded in historical presence and contribution, again RL3.  
- There is no explicit mention of administrative divisions or hukou, so RL2 is not directly supported.  
- There is no mention of dialect or linguistic differences, so RL4 is not supported.  
- The mention of ""归属感"" and discrimination is about social belonging but not about social embeddedness in terms of property or community connections, so RL6 is not clearly supported.  
- No discussion of functional livability or occupational typification is present.  
- The distinction between Yuhang and Hangzhou areas hints at intra-city spatial perceptions but the focus is more on family roots and historical legitimacy than on vernacular spatial authority (RL1). The author does mention ""老底子杭州屁大点地方"" (old-stock Hangzhou is a small place), but the main argument is about generational roots rather than spatial categorization.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 杭州 and its subareas (武林门，采荷，翠苑，朝晖): The author indicates that being able to name specific local area names within Hangzhou (especially the old urban area) triggers a switch to speaking the local dialect. This implies that knowledge of these local place names and speaking the local dialect are criteria or markers for being recognized as a local person.
- 老市区范围: The author specifies that the dialect is specifically from the old city area, acknowledging that dialects differ even a few kilometers away.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The use of specific local place names to identify insiders reflects RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it refers to intra-city spatial categories and local emotional maps.
- The automatic switch to speaking the local dialect (杭州话) as a marker of local identity reflects RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

- 浙大紫金港 (Zhejiang University Zijin Port)
- 龙翔桥 (Longxiang Bridge)
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)
- 三墩乡下人 (Sandun rural person)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author says they are from 西湖区三墩, specifically 浙大紫金港.
- When going to 龙翔桥, people say they are going to 杭州.
- The author states that externally they say they are 三墩乡下人 (Sandun rural person).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author distinguishes between the smaller area (三墩) and the larger city (杭州), indicating a shared social perception of spatial identity, e.g., 龙翔桥 is considered part of 杭州.
- The mention of ""对外都说自己三墩乡下人"" implies the author recognizes and accepts the social stereotype or identity label of ""乡下人"" (rural person) for 三墩, indicating a vernacular spatial identity.
- The author’s acceptance of the label ""三墩乡下人"" suggests they use local cultural or social identity standards based on spatial and social perceptions.
- No administrative, family rootedness, linguistic, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification logic is clearly present here.

Step 4: Output the result:

不一定因为杭州市区的瞧不起周边的又因为杭州政府做的不地道很多区的人都对杭州没有归属感，问你哪里人只是问你你觉得你是哪里人罢了,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 杭州市区 (Hangzhou urban area), 周边 (surrounding areas), 杭州政府 (Hangzhou government)

Step 2: The author states that many people from various districts around Hangzhou do not feel a sense of belonging to Hangzhou, not necessarily because the urban area looks down on the surrounding areas, but because of the government’s inadequate governance. The question ""Where are you from?"" is interpreted as asking ""Where do you feel you are from?"" This emphasizes subjective self-identification rather than official or administrative definitions.

Step 3: The core viewpoint is that local identity is defined by one's own feeling or subjective sense of belonging (""你觉得你是哪里人""), rather than external administrative or official criteria. This implies a rejection of administrative legitimacy (RL2) as the sole or main standard. Instead, the author highlights personal or psychological identification, which aligns with a vernacular, subjective spatial perception (RL1), focusing on emotional or cognitive belonging.

Step 4: The author implicitly supports RL1 (vernacular spatial authority) because the local identity depends on personal feelings about ""where one is from,"" which relates to collective or individual emotional maps rather than formal boundaries. The author does not mention family roots, dialect, property, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

我西湖区三墩镇，我都说自己杭州乡下人……跟他们城里人讲的话不一样,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities: 西湖区三墩镇, 杭州, 城里人

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author says ""我都说自己杭州乡下人"" (I say I am a rural person of Hangzhou).
- The author notes ""跟他们城里人讲的话不一样"" (My way of speaking is different from those city people).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses the distinction between ""乡下人"" (rural person) and ""城里人"" (city person), implying that language or speech differences mark local identity.
- The mention of different ways of speaking suggests a linguistic-cultural boundary.
- The author self-identifies based on this difference.

Therefore, the recognized logic is RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Output: RL4"

- 城里 (the city)
- 西湖区 (Xihu District)
- 老余杭 (Old Yuhang)
- 杭州话 (Hangzhou dialect)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author contrasts ""城里"" (the city) people who look down on ""乡下的"" (people from rural areas like themselves).
- The author states that 西湖区 is considered a ""乡下地方"" (rural area).
- They mention that in 西湖区, people speak 老余杭话 (Old Yuhang dialect), while people in the city speak 杭州话 (Hangzhou dialect).
- The author implies that there is a difference between these dialects and this difference creates a boundary or identity distinction.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses linguistic differences (dialect differences between 老余杭话 and 杭州话) to imply social/cultural identity differences between locals and outsiders.
- The author also uses vernacular spatial authority by labeling 西湖区 as ""乡下地方"" and distinguishing it from ""城里,"" indicating a local spatial identity division.
- The reference to dialect difference is a typical RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The spatial categorization of 西湖区 as ""乡下地方"" and 城里 as different areas with different identities corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author claims 西湖区 is considered ""乡下"" (countryside) because the local dialect spoken is 余杭话, whereas other districts speak 杭州话.
- The author uses the difference in dialects (余杭话 vs. 杭州话) as a criterion to define whether an area is ""local"" or ""countryside.""

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses dialect difference as a standard to define local identity, indicating Recognition Logic 4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Step 4: Output the result.

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that they are from 富阳, which was previously an independent city and only recently incorporated into 杭州. This suggests that the author uses administrative incorporation (划进杭州) as a criterion to define whether a place/person is local.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
The author emphasizes the administrative change (previously independent city, now incorporated into Hangzhou) as a standard for defining local identity. This matches Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

Step 4: Output results:

Output: RL1","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 滨江
- 萧山
- 市区
- 东边
- 七堡
- 杭州

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author mentions that locals from 滨江 and 萧山 say ""going to 杭州"" when they go to the 市区, implying that they consider 市区 as distinct from their area.
- They also mention that 东边 is considered to extend to 七堡, but their classmates do not think 七堡 is part of the city center.
- The author criticizes the logic of including their own home area into the city center by this kind of boundary drawing.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses how locals perceive and draw boundaries of what counts as the city center or local area.
- This is about collective, habitual local perceptions of intra-city spatial categories, not official administrative boundaries.
- The author uses the example of locals' common spatial perceptions and symbolic distinctions to define ""local person"" identity or local areas.
- This matches Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.

想起有一个前同事，爸妈住解放路，自己结婚了住凤起路，上班在庆春路，她这个土生土长的杭州本地人只认得这3条路,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 解放路 (Jiefang Road)
- 凤起路 (Fengqi Road)
- 庆春路 (Qingchun Road)
- 杭州 (Hangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author describes a former colleague whose parents live on 解放路, she lives on 凤起路 after marriage, and works on 庆春路.
- The colleague is described as a ""土生土长的杭州本地人"" (native born and raised local of Hangzhou) who only recognizes these three roads.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author highlights that this colleague is considered a genuine local because she was born and raised in Hangzhou, with deep roots in the city.
- The emphasis on ""土生土长"" (born and raised) fits the Family Rootedness logic (RL3).
- The mention of specific roads known by the colleague implies a vernacular spatial cognition of local identity, i.e., the local person is defined by their familiarity with certain local spatial markers (RL1).
- However, the main explicit criterion the author uses to identify the colleague as a ""local person"" is that she is ""土生土长"" (born and raised), which is a direct RL3 indicator.
- The roads mentioned are more descriptive of her spatial familiarity but do not explicitly serve as the author's standard for defining ""local person."" The author only states she ""only recognizes these three roads,"" which may imply vernacular spatial knowledge but not explicitly used as a criterion.
- Given the instructions, we should only annotate RL1 if the author explicitly proposes or assumes a logic for classifying areas or uses them to define local identity. Here, the roads are mentioned to illustrate the colleague's limited local spatial knowledge, but not as a standard for defining ""local person.""
- Therefore, the dominant recognition logic is RL3.

Step 4: Output the results:

你都划到萧山了，就把我最顶上的大塘栖也划进去呗，让我也体验体验住在市区是啥体验,RL2,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 萧山  
- 大塘栖  
- 市区

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions that ""萧山"" has been included (划到萧山了), and suggests including ""大塘栖"" as well, to ""体验体验住在市区是啥体验"" (experience what it is like to live in the urban area).  
- This implies the author is discussing administrative or jurisdictional boundaries (划到萧山, 把大塘栖划进去), and relates these boundaries to the identity or experience of living in the ""市区"" (urban area).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author is focusing on the administrative delineation of areas (划到萧山, 划进去), and connecting this to the concept of ""living in the city"" or being ""local"" to the urban area.  
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 2 (RL2): Administrative Legitimacy, as the author uses official administrative divisions or boundary changes as a basis for defining or experiencing ""local"" identity.

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL2"
杭州人至少要说杭州话，萧山话杭州人都听不懂，硬划进杭州市区，别说杭州人了，问问萧山人干吗？,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 杭州人 (Hangzhou people)
- 萧山话 (Xiaoshan dialect)
- 杭州市区 (Hangzhou urban area)
- 萧山人 (Xiaoshan people)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author claims that ""Hangzhou people at least have to speak Hangzhou dialect.""
- Xiaoshan dialect is not understood by Hangzhou people.
- Xiaoshan is forcibly included into the Hangzhou urban area.
- The author questions whether Xiaoshan people should be considered Hangzhou people.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses dialect as a key standard to define who is a true Hangzhou person (""Hangzhou people at least have to speak Hangzhou dialect,"" ""Xiaoshan dialect is not understood by Hangzhou people""), which matches RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The author also disputes the administrative inclusion of Xiaoshan into Hangzhou urban area (""forcibly included into Hangzhou urban area""), implying resistance to administrative legitimacy as a defining standard, but since the author resists this logic, RL2 is not annotated.
- The mention of forcibly including Xiaoshan into the city area implies the author recognizes the common official boundary but rejects it as a valid identity standard. So RL1 might be implied because the author distinguishes local identity based on common or vernacular spatial boundaries (""萧山话杭州人都听不懂,"" ""硬划进杭州市区""), but the main argument is about dialect as identity marker.
- However, the core argument centers on dialect as the key criterion, so RL4 is the clearest match.

"广州，是大家再熟悉不过的城市，是一座开放包容、海纳百川、有着2000多年历史的文化名城。广州的美食驰名中外，民俗文化丰富多样，温柔好听的粤语更是深受许多广州外地人的欢迎。但说到广州城，你们又知道是哪里吗？
 其实，以前的广州城≠现在的广州城区，两者并非同等概念。而且广州是1921年才设立为广州市的。再者不同地方的人对广州城区的理解也不同。在外地人看来，越秀区、天河区和海珠区就是广州城区，因为东山口、北京路、越秀公园、体育西、珠江新城、广州塔都是许多外地人来广州游玩的第一印象和首选去处，也是广州的热门景点；而在我们广州本地人乃至广府人看来，广州城区就是指“老四区”：越秀，东山，荔湾（不含芳村），河南（即海珠区），需要注意的是，老广所说的“河南”是仅指海珠区南华东、同福西一带，而剩余海珠区大部分原属番禺县新滘镇；东山在05年并入了现在的越秀区。
 但实际上，以前的广州城可比现在的城区要小的多，严格来说就是指越秀老城区，即旧时的番禺城。东山、西关都属城外，桂花岗、环市北一带以前也是农田区域。而广州城的由来，大概得从秦汉时期的“任嚣城”（今北京路一带）开始说起。

Step 2: Matching arguments to each named entity:
The text provides a historical administrative evolution of the place now known as 花都区, formerly 花县. It traces its jurisdictional changes from Han dynasty to modern times, showing how the area was governed by different counties and administrative regions, culminating in its current status as a district of Guangzhou city.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
The author focuses on administrative changes and official administrative status over time. The entire text is about how 花都 has been governed by various administrative entities, with dates and official changes highlighted. This shows the author uses **administrative legitimacy** as the standard for defining the identity or status of this place.

No mention of vernacular spatial authority, family rootedness, dialect or cultural features, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is present. The text is purely about official administrative changes.

没错，大致就是东山还没并入的越秀区，还有一些后来并入的比如矿泉街道、桂花岗也不算进去,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 越秀区 (Yuexiu District)
- 矿泉街道 (Kuangquan Street)
- 桂花岗 (Guihuagang)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that Dongshan (still not merged into Yuexiu District), and some areas later merged such as Kuangquan Street and Guihuagang, ""are not counted in"" (not included in some local identity or area scope).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
The author is defining which areas ""count"" or ""do not count"" as part of a local area (Yuexiu District), focusing on administrative changes (merging or not merging into the district). This is about the administrative legitimacy or scope of the area.

However, the author says ""东山还没并入的越秀区"" (Dongshan not yet merged into Yuexiu District) and ""一些后来并入的比如矿泉街道、桂花岗也不算进去"" (some later merged areas like Kuangquan Street, Guihuagang also not counted). This reflects the author's view on which areas belong or not to the core local area, based on administrative mergers.

This matches RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), because the author is discussing which areas are considered part of ""local"" space or not, from the perspective of common or local perceptions about area boundaries (even though administrative merger is mentioned, the focus is on ""not counting"" them as local areas, which is more about the cognitive or identity boundary than pure administrative division).

Could it also be RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)? The author mentions administrative merging explicitly, which is a legal/administrative fact. But the author is using the administrative merging as a basis to decide inclusion or exclusion in the local identity scope.

The question is: does the author endorse administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining local identity, or are they expressing a vernacular or cognitive boundary that does not coincide with the administrative boundary?

Since the author says ""还没并入的越秀区"" (not yet merged into Yuexiu District) and ""一些后来并入的...也不算进去"" (some later merged also not counted), the author is rejecting administrative merger as a basis for inclusion. So the author is not using administrative legitimacy to define local identity.

Therefore, RL2 is not endorsed by the author.

The author is defining ""local"" area based on local knowledge or emotional maps about which areas count or not, despite the administrative boundaries.

Therefore, RL1 is the main recognition logic.

Step 4: Output the result.

- The author says they grew up in Henan.
- The author speaks with a strong rural accent from Panyu and Shunde.
- The author identifies as a ""乡下仔"" (country boy), indicating rural origins.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""满口番禺顺德乡下口音"" (speaking with a rural accent from Panyu and Shunde) indicates using dialect/accent as a standard for local identity recognition → RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- The self-identification as ""乡下仔"" (country boy) and the emphasis on growing up in Henan shows family rootedness and growth history → RL3 (Family Rootedness).

Step 4: Output the combined recognition logics.

Step 2: The author states that they have ancestral hall, dividends, and land, and have never doubted their own identity.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- ""祠堂"" (ancestral hall) implies family historical roots → RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- ""分红"" (dividends) and ""地"" (land/property) imply social embeddedness, material assets, local fixed assets → RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions ""年年有分红"" (annual dividends) and ""有祠堂"" (having an ancestral hall), and ""有时候吃饭都要走去祠堂"" (sometimes even go to the ancestral hall to eat).
- These indicate the author uses family ancestral hall and the associated dividends as a sign of local rootedness and social embeddedness.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- ""祠堂"" and ""分红"" imply family historical roots and inherited local resources.
- This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness) because ancestral halls are linked to lineage and generational ties.
- It also corresponds to RL6 (Social Embeddedness) because the mention of ""分红"" (dividends) from the ancestral hall indicates embeddedness in local community resources and social relations.

- 台山阿伯 (Taishan uncle)  
- 大石 (Dashí, a place name)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author mentions their comrade from Taishan who only registered their household (入户) in Dashí in their teens but still receives dividends (分红). The author expresses uncertainty about how their family managed this.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""入户"" (household registration) indicates a focus on administrative registration status as a basis for local identity or related benefits.  
- Receiving dividends (分红) may imply local embeddedness or property ownership, but the author is unsure how the family achieved this, so no explicit endorsement is present.  
- The core focus is on the household registration timing and its impact on local benefits.  

Step 4: Output the results  
The author's mention of household registration as a key factor in local recognition aligns with RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy). The author does not explicitly endorse or reject the other logics.

Output: RL4","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 先生 (husband, from Zhejiang)
- 两个仔 (two sons)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 广州: The author considers speaking the local dialect (""白话"") as the defining feature of being a Guangzhou person (""广州人"").
- 先生 (husband): Although from Zhejiang, because he studied in Guangzhou and has lived there for over 20 years, and speaks standard local dialect, the author regards him as ""老广"" (local Guangzhou person).
- 两个仔 (two sons): Born and raised in Guangzhou but do not speak the local dialect; the author considers them simply Chinese, not Guangzhou locals.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The core standard the author uses to define ""local person"" identity is the ability to speak the local dialect fluently.
- The husband is considered local due to his fluent use of the local dialect.
- The two sons are not considered local because they lack this linguistic feature despite birth and upbringing in Guangzhou.
- Thus, the author endorses linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as the main criterion.

- The author notes that several Guangzhou friends have similar experiences.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The mention of speaking or not speaking the local dialect as a marker of local identity indicates a focus on linguistic-cultural features.

The author implies a preference or positive evaluation of speaking ""白话"" (local dialect) as it makes chatting (""吹水"") easier and more comfortable. The mention of ""普通话少小小味道"" (Mandarin lacks some flavor) also highlights the distinctiveness of the local dialect.

Step 3: The underlying recognition logic here is about linguistic-cultural recognition — the use of local dialect as a marker of identity and local belonging. The author implicitly endorses the idea that speaking the local dialect is a standard or marker for being ""local"" or for ease of social interaction among locals.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that many ""外地人"" (non-locals) speak ""白话"" (Cantonese dialect).
- Specifically, many from Guangxi and Hunan speak this dialect.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is discussing language/dialect use as a marker distinguishing locals and outsiders.
- The mention that ""外地人大把会讲白话"" implies that speaking the local dialect is an important criterion for defining local identity.
- This fits Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Step 4: Output the results.

- No specific named entities mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author contrasts ""真的学起来了"" (people really learning the local dialect) with ""很多不友好的外地人"" (many unfriendly outsiders) who react negatively when spoken to in the local dialect.  
- The author emphasizes speaking the local dialect (""白话"") as a standard to identify or evaluate locals versus outsiders.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement

祠堂有你的名字才算是广州人，不然不算，这是最基本的，跟你去陈家祠买不买门票没关系。你逻辑都搞不清楚,":

Output: RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 祠堂 (ancestral hall)
- 陈家祠 (Chen Clan Ancestral Hall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- Regarding 广州人 (people from Guangzhou), the author states that having one's name in the ancestral hall (祠堂) is the basic criterion to be considered a Guangzhou person. Buying tickets to Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is irrelevant.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The criterion ""having your name in the ancestral hall"" implies recognition based on family roots, lineage, or ancestral ties.
- This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- There is no mention of administrative division, dialect, social embeddedness, or spatial authority.
- The author rejects a superficial criterion (buying tickets), emphasizing ancestral connection.

陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 陈家祠 (Chen Family Ancestral Hall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author says: ""陈家祠有你分红就关你事，冇就过主啦"" — roughly meaning ""If Chen Family Ancestral Hall pays you dividends, then it concerns you; if not, then just ignore it."" This suggests that the author's view of being connected to the local group (represented here by Chen Family Ancestral Hall) is related to whether one receives dividends (a form of community benefit or economic share).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind the viewpoint  
The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) from 陈家祠 implies that being a ""local person"" or belonging to this local group is connected to having economic/social embeddedness — i.e., being part of the local community's property or economic network. The author uses economic ties and social embeddedness as a criterion for local identity.

Step 4: Output the results  
This corresponds to Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness.

- 家 (family)  
- 族谱 (genealogy)  
- 阿公阿婆 (grandparents)  
- 阿爷和阿公 (grandfather and great-grandfather)  
- 祠堂 (ancestral hall)  
- 先人祖坟 (ancestors' graves)  
- 大宗族 (large clan)  

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
- The author says their family no longer cares about genealogy (""族谱"") and that most genealogies now are reconstructed after the reform era through collective funding.  
- The author's grandparents were previously landlords who wished to sever relations for safety.  
- Although the surnames of the grandfather and great-grandfather are the same as the major clan in their original village, the ancestral hall (""祠堂"") is not from their local area.  
- Worship at the ancestral grave only goes back to the great-grandfather's generation.  
- The author questions the legitimacy of the ancestral hall and genealogy without a large clan foundation.  

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author emphasizes lineage, ancestors, and generational ties, discussing ancestral halls, surnames, and genealogy.  
- The argument centers on the depth and authenticity of family roots and whether the ancestral hall belongs to their local area, highlighting the importance of family historical roots and growth history.  
- The author implicitly uses the logic that genuine ""local person"" identity relates to ancestral lineage and clan legitimacy.  

Step 4: Output the result:

- 东至东山口 (east to Dongshankou)
- 北至小北 (north to Xiaobei)
- 南至南关 (south to Nanguan)
- 西关东山三元里河南四区 (Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, Henan four districts)
- 大部分有分红的村 (most villages with dividends)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author defines the core area of Guangzhou city by spatial boundaries (west to Ximenkou, east to Dongshankou, north to Xiaobei, south to Nanguan, including Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, Henan four districts).
- The author notes that most villages that receive dividends are not considered part of Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses spatial boundaries and traditional area names to define the core Guangzhou city area, indicating a vernacular, habitual, or historically sedimented local perception of intra-city spatial categories. This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""dividends"" from villages implies a recognition of social embeddedness or community resources linked to local identity. The author states most dividend-receiving villages are not Guangzhou, implying the dividends or community assets are a factor in defining local identity. This fits RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

Step 4: Output the results:

其实是反过来的，村民以前在老广眼里是乡下人，只不过郊区城镇化之后村民平均生活水平比之前的老城区市民高，现在基本在广州会粤语都当你广州人，只不过有些人挑拨离间，广州人又要有祠堂分红又要在老三区，能满足这俩点的全广州找不出20万个，那还得了,RL4,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 广州 (Guangzhou)  
- 老广 (old Cantonese people, local Cantonese)  
- 郊区 (suburban areas)  
- 老城区 (old urban areas)  
- 祠堂分红 (ancestral hall dividends)  
- 老三区 (old three districts)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 广州: The author claims that nowadays, basically anyone who speaks Cantonese in Guangzhou is considered a Guangzhou person.  
- 老广: Previously considered villagers as ""乡下人"" (country bumpkins), but now after suburban urbanization, villagers' average living standard surpasses that of old urban area citizens.  
- 祠堂分红 and 老三区: Some people argue that to be a ""true"" Guangzhou person, one must have both ancestral hall dividends and live in the old three districts, but the author criticizes this standard as unrealistic because fewer than 200,000 people in the entire Guangzhou can meet both conditions.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention that speaking Cantonese is now the main standard for being considered a Guangzhou person indicates a **Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4)**.  
- The criticism of the standard requiring ancestral hall dividends and residence in the old three districts points to a resistance to **Family Rootedness (RL3)** and **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)** as strict criteria, implying the author rejects these rigid standards.  
- The mention of ""old three districts"" as a spatial boundary refers to **Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1)**, but the author opposes the strict reliance on this standard, so RL1 is not annotated as endorsed.  
- The ""祠堂分红"" (ancestral hall dividends) relates to **Social Embeddedness (RL6)**, but again the author criticizes this as a restrictive criterion, so RL6 is not endorsed.  
- The author explicitly supports the standard of speaking Cantonese (RL4) as the main criterion.

Step 4: Output the results

- 赤岗村 (Chigang village)
- 三水 (Sanshui)
- 土著 (local person / indigenous person)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions a classmate from 赤岗村 who says their hometown is 三水.
- The author expresses confusion about why people think having dividends (分红) and ancestral halls (祠堂) are standards for being a 土著 (local person).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""dividends"" and ""ancestral halls"" as criteria for 土著 identity relates to social embeddedness, i.e., economic and symbolic resources tied to local identity.
- The author is questioning the logic that having economic benefits and ancestral halls defines 土著 status.
- The author does not explicitly oppose these standards but expresses confusion about them.
- Since the author is reflecting on the logic of using economic/social embeddedness (dividends, ancestral halls) to define local person identity, this corresponds to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- No mention of administrative status, dialect, family roots, or spatial authority.
- No mention of livability or occupational typification.

- 一村人 (a whole village)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author mentions their family has lived in Guangzhou for several generations (""我屋企对上几代都系广州""), they have Guangzhou ID card (身份证4401), they speak Cantonese (""一直都系讲粤语""), and they live in a village that has dividend distribution (""住村度有分红"").
- Others say ""no ancestral hall (冇祠堂) means not local,"" which the author disputes because their whole village lacks an ancestral hall, implying they would be considered outsiders if that was the standard.
- The author is surprised and laughs at this exclusionary criterion.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The author uses:
  - Family Rootedness (RL3): Emphasizes several generations of family in Guangzhou.
  - Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4): Speaks Cantonese continuously.
  - Social Embeddedness (RL6): Lives in a village with dividends (implying social integration and property or community resources).
  - Administrative Legitimacy (RL2): Has Guangzhou ID card (身份证4401).
- The author mentions the ""no ancestral hall"" standard as a criterion used by others but seems to reject it or at least question it, so do not annotate RL3 based on the ancestral hall standard.
- The author accepts family generational roots, language, administrative ID, and community dividends as indicators of local identity.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author claims that being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) means one is a local person.
- The author states they came to Guangzhou as a baby and grew up there for decades.
- The author proudly identifies as a Guangzhou person.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- Emphasis on ""born and raised"" and growth history aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- No mention of administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, or other logics.

- 广州 (Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to entity:
- The author defines ""真正广州人"" (real Guangzhou people) as those with family roots within three generations in Guangzhou.
- ""新广州人"" (new Guangzhou people) are those within two generations.
- ""广州移民"" (Guangzhou immigrants) are the first generation who pioneered.
- ""外省广州人"" (non-local Guangzhou people) are those three generations in Guangzhou but do not speak Cantonese, with ancestors from outside the province.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses family lineage/generational depth to define local identity (three generations, two generations, first generation).
- The use of language (not speaking Cantonese) as a criterion to distinguish identity also appears.
- Therefore, RL3 (Family Rootedness) and RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) are both present.

- The author says their father is from Guangzhou Tianhe (local).
- The author's hukou (household registration) is with the mother's hometown due to dividends.
- The father insists the author is local to Guangzhou.
- The author speaks fluent Cantonese and grew up in Guangzhou.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The father’s insistence on ""you are Guangzhou local"" despite hukou being elsewhere implies disagreement with administrative legitimacy as the sole criterion, and endorses family rootedness or personal growth in the city.
- The author mentions speaking fluent Cantonese and growing up in Guangzhou, which is a linguistic-cultural marker (RL4).
- The father's identity claim is based on family connection (father is from Guangzhou Tianhe), indicating family rootedness (RL3).
- The hukou registration is mentioned but is not endorsed by the author as a standard for local identity; in fact, the author questions it, so RL2 is not endorsed.

- The author defines ""local person"" in Guangzhou by two criteria:
  1. Having a village ancestral hall (族谱), which implies family lineage and historical roots.
  2. Having dividends, implying some form of shared community or economic embeddedness.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ancestral hall and clan genealogy (族谱) aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of dividends (分红) implies social embeddedness, community belonging, and shared economic resources, which aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

- 广州居民: defined by whether the hukou (household registration) is in Guangzhou.
- 老广: defined as those with village dividends (implying family roots or inherited social embeddedness).
- 新广: defined as those who bought property and settled in Guangzhou (implying property ownership and social embeddedness).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- Using hukou (户口) as a criterion for ""广州居民"" identity corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- Defining 老广 by having village dividends (分红) implies family historical roots and social embeddedness; dividends relate to social embeddedness, so RL6.
- Defining 新广 by buying property and settling implies social embeddedness through property ownership, so RL6.

- 南关 (Nanguan)
- 西关 (Xiguan)
- 东山 (Dongshan)
- 三元里 (Sanyuanli)
- 河南四区 (Henan Four Districts)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author defines the boundaries of ""广州城系"" (Guangzhou city system) by specific local areas (Ximen Kou, Dongshan Kou, Xiaobei, Nanguan, Xiguan, Dongshan, Sanyuanli, Henan Four Districts).
- The author states that most villages that have dividends (分红) are not considered part of Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses a spatial, habitual, historically sedimented local perception of the city's intra-area boundaries, defining which areas are included in the local ""广州城系"" identity. This is not based on administrative divisions but on local spatial perception and shared understandings.
- The mention of dividends (分红) villages not being Guangzhou suggests an economic or social embeddedness perspective, but the author only states this as a fact without explicitly linking it to local person identity definition.
- The core argument is about the spatial boundaries of what counts as ""local"" Guangzhou.

Step 4: Output:
The author clearly uses Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) to define the ""local"" Guangzhou area.

Output: Recognition Logic 1"

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author denies that ""老广"" (local people from the city) have dividends (分红).
- Dividends are only for people from villages and towns.
- ""老广"" are people who live in the urban area.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses ""住市区"" (living in the urban area) as a criterion to define ""老广"" identity.
- The mention of dividends (分红) is stated as a fact about villages/towns, not as a criterion for defining ""老广"" identity.
- The core defining standard here is spatial: living in the city area vs. village/town.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, as the author distinguishes locals by the urban spatial category (""住市区"" vs ""村镇"").

Step 4: Output the result.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matched: The author says their grandfather came south as a cadre, implying a family migration history. Although the spoken language (white speech dialect) is the same, the author feels no sense of belonging.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: 
- The author refers to family migration history (""爷爷南下干部过来的""), implying that family roots or generational settlement affect local identity.
- The mention of ""内心里没有归属感"" despite dialect similarity suggests that linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) is not sufficient or is insufficient for belonging.
- The core logic used by the author to define local identity is family rootedness (RL3), since the lack of local family roots leads to lack of belonging.

- The author questions whether being a local person (""本地人"") has any essential difference for the listener, implying that since the listener does not receive dividends (""分红""), the local identity might not matter.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) relates to economic benefits tied to local social embeddedness or material participation in the community.  
- The author implies that local identity might be tied to receiving community dividends or economic benefits, which relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).  
- The author questions the significance of local identity if such economic/social embeddedness (dividends) is absent.

- The author identifies themselves as a third-generation native born and raised in Guangzhou, self-recognized as a local ""土著"" (indigenous local).
- This self-identity is shaken when local villagers with ancestral halls claim the author is not a ""土著.""
- The author's grandfather's generation only came to Guangzhou to work and settle.
- The household registration (户口本) still shows a rural place name, not Guangzhou.
- The author feels unable to refute this claim.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author emphasizes family rootedness and generational depth (""第三代"", ""阿爷个代先出来"", ""户口本依然显示乡下地名而唔喺广州""), showing the importance of family migration history and official administrative registration.

- 茂名: The author mentions ancestral roots in Maoming but states that family no longer has connections there, implying they do not consider themselves from there.  
- 番禺: The author notes that their grandfather was a teacher there and built a house in Panyu, but ""番禺嘅归属"" is another topic, so no direct definition logic about Panyu is given.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:  
- The author uses ""户口在广州"" (hukou in Guangzhou) as a criterion, which is an administrative/legal status — RL2.  
- The author also says ""且会讲白话，有文化认同"" (can speak Cantonese and have cultural identity), which involves dialect and cultural recognition — RL4.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements related to 广州:
- The author's mother’s family has been in Guangzhou for generations.
- Their family lost land and property and became ""疍家人"" (a local minority group), without land they are not considered villagers.
- The author's grandfather was born in Guangzhou.
- The author feels they are a Guangzhou person but lacks dividends, land, and housing.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""世代广州人"" (generations of Guangzhou people) and ""我爷在广州出世"" (grandfather born in Guangzhou) indicates an emphasis on family historical roots and generational settlement → RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of ""无分红无地无屋"" (no dividends, no land, no house) relates to property and social embeddedness, but the author explicitly states that despite lacking these, they feel they are Guangzhou people. So the author does not use these as criteria to deny local identity. Instead, the absence of these is noted but not used to define local identity. So no RL6.
- The mention of being ""疍家人"" and ""无地唔系村民"" (no land, not villagers) is a recognition of social status but the author is questioning local identity. This may imply social embeddedness, but the author challenges it by saying ""I think I am Guangzhou person,"" so the author rejects property/land as the sole criteria.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, dialect, spatial boundaries, or occupation.

Step 4: Output:
The author uses family rootedness as the main criterion for defining local identity.

- 阿妈 (mother)
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 村 (village)
- 祖屋宅基地 (ancestral house and homestead land)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity
- The author discusses the mother's place of origin and hukou registration (""身份证唔系44010，因为阿妈吾系广州宜边，要先入阿妈度，我阿妈先可以签过黎广州""), which relates to administrative registration and legitimacy.
- Mentions living in ancestral house and village participation (""住祖屋宅基地，条村年年爬龙船，有阵时玩船头旗位"") indicating family rootedness and cultural traditions.
- Mentions ""冇分红"" (no dividends) and ""啊嘛挂左罗左D死股，每年分D西甘多钱"" (the grandmother has shares that get dividends), indicating social embeddedness through community economic participation.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement
- The mention of ID card number and mother's place of origin is about hukou and administrative legitimacy → RL2.
- The emphasis on living in ancestral house, village activities, and family generations is about family rootedness → RL3.
- The mention of village dividends and shares relates to social embeddedness and economic ties → RL6.

Step 4: Output the results

- 从化 (Conghua)
- 广州 (Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that their family has a several-hundred-year-old ancestral hall in a village in Conghua, which ""definitely counts as Conghua local"" (implying family historical roots).
- However, after Conghua was incorporated into Guangzhou some years ago, their ID card changed, and the author wonders if they still count as Guangzhou locals.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of a ""several-hundred-year-old ancestral hall"" and being ""definitely Conghua local"" strongly implies RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of ""incorporated into Guangzhou"" and the ID card change implies administrative division, i.e., RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

这么说吧，广州前段时间村里分分红，你家有吗？没就不算,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 广州 (Guangzhou), 村里 (village)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
The author states that in Guangzhou, recently villages distributed dividends (""分红""), and questions whether your family received any. The implication is that if your family did not receive dividends, you are not considered local (""没就不算"").

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
The author uses the receipt of village dividends as a criterion for being considered a local person. This is related to social embeddedness and possession of local community resources or symbolic economic status, which corresponds to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

Step 4: Output the results:

Output: RL6"
我住德政中，无村无分红,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 德政中 (a place)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author states ""我住德政中"" (I live in Dezhong).
- ""无村无分红"" (no village, no dividends) suggests a lack of village-level community or associated economic benefits.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""无村无分红"" (no village, no dividends) implies the author is referring to the absence of community-level economic embeddedness or social embeddedness.
- This reflects RL6 (Social Embeddedness), as the author highlights the lack of community resources or dividends that might influence local identity.
- The statement about living in ""德政中"" without village or dividends indicates a perspective related to social embeddedness rather than administrative or vernacular spatial authority.

Step 4: Output the result:

只有广州农村人才算广州人吗我们公司主管是土生土长的广州人，但是一直住在靠近市区，家里也没有分红,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities: 广州 (Guangzhou), 公司主管 (company supervisor)

Step 2: The author questions whether only rural Guangzhou people count as Guangzhou locals. The supervisor is described as a native Guangzhou person (""土生土长的广州人"") living near the urban area, but the family does not have dividends.

Step 3: Recognition logic behind the author's viewpoint:

- ""土生土长的广州人"" (born and raised locally) reflects RL3 (Family Rootedness).

- Mentioning living near the city area may relate to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), but the author does not explicitly use this to define local identity here.

- Mention of ""家里也没有分红"" (family does not have dividends) implies economic embeddedness but the author does not explicitly endorse this as a criterion.

The core logic the author uses to define a ""local person"" here is ""born and raised locally"" (RL3).

Step 4: Output

- ""分红"" (dividends/shares)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author mentions having an ancestral hall and genealogy but no dividends, expressing dissatisfaction (""阴公"" meaning ""no luck"" or ""unfortunate""). This implies a focus on family lineage and possibly social embeddedness.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""祠堂"" and ""族谱"" relates to family historical roots, emphasizing generational ties and ancestry. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- The mention of ""分红"" (dividends) relates to economic/social embeddedness, property, or community resources, which corresponds to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

- 佛山 (Foshan)
- 乡下 (countryside)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 佛山: The author considers themselves a local Foshan person (""佛山人佛山本地独生女""), although not a ""正宗本土本地人"" (authentic original local person), but a ""新本地人"" (new local person). Their grandparents' generation already lived in Foshan, and they have no relatives in the countryside, feeling no sense of belonging there.
- 乡下: The countryside is where the ancestors came from but now has no relatives, and the author feels no belonging there.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author defines ""local person"" partly based on family rootedness: grandparents' generation already living in Foshan, which supports RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author emphasizes their identity as a Foshan person, not by administrative or other factors, but by family historical roots and personal growth history.
- No mention of administrative divisions or dialect, or livability or social embeddedness.
- The distinction between ""正宗本土本地人"" and ""新本地人"" suggests family generational depth matters.
- No direct spatial boundary or vernacular spatial authority logic is presented.
- No mention of dialect or language.
- No mention of property or social embeddedness.
- No occupational typification.

- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 爷爷老家 (grandfather's hometown)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 广州: The author believes that if you internally consider Guangzhou your hometown, culturally identify with it, and think of Guangzhou as your hometown when asked, then you are a local person.
- 爷爷老家: Even if your grandfather is from somewhere else and you speak that hometown dialect at home and visit every year, the author argues that this does not make you a local person.
- The author emphasizes that being a local person means truly recognizing and identifying with the local culture and food, and not having doubts about where you are from.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes internal cultural identification and recognition (认同本地文化饮食, 打心底里认同) as the standard.
- The author contrasts external family roots (grandfather's hometown) with the internal cultural identity.
- The key is cultural identity and recognition of the local culture, not family roots or dialect.
- This aligns with Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition, because cultural recognition and identity are emphasized.
- However, the author explicitly says that speaking the grandfather's hometown dialect does not make one local, so dialect per se is not the standard, but the cultural identification is important.
- This also aligns with Recognition Logic 3 (RL3) somewhat, since the author rejects family roots as a sufficient criterion.
- The main focus is cultural identification, which is closest to RL4.
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, vernacular spatial authority, or other logics.

Step 2: Viewpoint statement: To judge if someone is a local of Guangzhou, the author says there is only one standard: having dividends (分红), ancestral hall (祠堂), and land (地).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- ""Dividends,"" ""ancestral hall,"" and ""land"" relate to family roots, lineage, and inheritance.
- These emphasize generational family ties and historical roots in the area.
- This matches Recognition Logic 3 (RL3): Family Rootedness.

- No specific named entities mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The text asks about ""rent collection"" and ""year-end dividends,"" which relate to community resources or economic benefits.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The questions imply concern about whether the community or area provides economic benefits or dividends to its residents. This relates to the possession of community resources or economic status as a marker of local embeddedness.  
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status).

Step 4: Output the results

- No specific named entities are mentioned.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The text ""有分红就算吧"" (""If there are dividends, then it counts"") implies that receiving dividends (a form of community or property-based benefit) is a criterion for being considered local.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of ""dividends"" suggests a focus on economic embeddedness and material/social integration into the community. This aligns with RL6: Social Embeddedness, which involves judging local identity based on possession of local fixed assets, community resources, and economic ties.

Step 4: Output the results

Step 2: The author states: ""你唔识得讲白话就只能系本地捞"" (""If you don't know how to speak Cantonese, you can only work as a local [person]""). This implies that speaking the local dialect (Cantonese) is a criterion for being a local or having local status.

Step 3: The recognition logic here is based on language ability as a marker of local identity.

Step 4: According to the RL definitions, this corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.

Output: RL4"

Step 2: The author expresses that regardless of where one lives (including 白云, 越秀, 荔湾), whether a native with dividends or a so-called new Guangzhou person, only those who can speak 广州话 (Cantonese) can be considered Guangzhou people. If one cannot speak Cantonese, they should not claim to be Guangzhou people.

Step 3: The author's standard for defining ""local person"" (广州人) is based on the ability to speak the local dialect (广州话), i.e., linguistic-cultural recognition. The mention of areas (白云, 越秀, 荔湾) is to show that location or native status does not matter as much as dialect ability. The core logic is RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author mentions the husband is a ""佛山本地人"" (local Foshan person), has ""分红"" (dividends), ""族谱"" (family genealogy), and a ""祠堂几百年历史"" (ancestral hall with centuries of history, considered cultural relics).
- The son’s hukou (household registration) is with the author, born where the author is, questioning if the son counts as a Foshan person.
- The classmate’s husband is also a Foshan person with dividends, but the daughter’s hukou is in Foshan, yet the family lives elsewhere; questioning if the daughter counts as Foshan person.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author stresses family roots (genealogy, ancestral hall) and economic/social embeddedness (dividends).
- The hukou (household registration) is discussed as a factor but questioned.
- The family lineage and inheritance (族谱, 祠堂) indicate RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- Dividends (分红) indicate RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- Hukou (户口) is mentioned but the author questions its legitimacy, so it's discussed but not clearly endorsed as a definitive standard, so no RL2.

The core endorsed recognition logic is RL3 (Family Rootedness). RL6 and RL4 are mentioned but the author does not endorse them as sufficient standards; the main standard emphasized is ancestral roots.

Output: RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 老家 (hometown/ancestral home)
- 大院 (the residential compound)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 广州: The author states their grandfather's generation settled in Guangzhou, father and self are born and raised locally (""土生土长""), but ancestral graves and ancestral hall remain in the hometown, with yearly visits to sweep graves.
- 广州: Despite speaking fluent Cantonese (""广州话""), the author feels unable to fully integrate into local social circles (""跟本地人的圈子也融不进去"").
- 广州: The author believes that only those whose ancestors were born in Guangzhou (""祖辈生于广州"") can truly form the identity of a Guangzhou person (""广州人认同"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The emphasis on generational depth (""爷爷那一辈来广州"", ""父亲和自己都是土生土长"", ""祖辈生于广州"") corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of inability to integrate into local social circles despite speaking the dialect hints at RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) and RL6 (Social Embeddedness), but the author explicitly states that speaking Cantonese alone is not enough, implying that dialect is necessary but not sufficient.
- The focus on ancestral graves and rituals (扫墓) also supports RL3.
- The mention of ""跟本地人的圈子也融不进去"" suggests social embeddedness (RL6), but the author’s core argument is about identity formation based on family roots rather than social connections.
- The dialect (Cantonese) is mentioned but in a negating way: ""讲着一口广州话但是就是觉得差了这么一点"", so the author does not fully endorse dialect as sufficient for local identity, thus RL4 is not strongly endorsed.

Step 4: Output results:
The core endorsed recognition logic is RL3 (Family Rootedness). RL6 and RL4 are mentioned but the author does not endorse them as sufficient standards; the main standard emphasized is ancestral roots.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 广州: The author questions if they are a Guangzhou person. The author's grandfather moved from Dongguan to Guangzhou during the Anti-Japanese War. The mother is from Guangzhou countryside. The author's hukou follows the mother, who has hukou in the village.
- 村: The author has village dividends but is considered an ""outsider"" in the village because of different surname.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes hukou registration (户口) and the location of hukou (village vs. city) as an important factor in identity.
- The author also mentions family origin and migration history (grandfather moved during wartime, mother is from countryside).
- The hukou and family root aspects are used to discuss local identity.
- The mention of hukou location corresponds to RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).
- The mention of family origin and ancestral migration corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).

- The author mentions ""听讲话无祠堂"" (no ancestral hall for listening to speeches), ""非农户口"" (non-agricultural hukou), and ""都有分红"" (all have dividends).

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- ""无祠堂"" (no ancestral hall) implies a lack of family roots or ancestral ties, related to RL3 (Family Rootedness). The author implicitly contrasts those with ancestral halls and those without, suggesting family rootedness is a criterion for local identity.  
- ""非农户口"" (non-agricultural hukou) directly references hukou status, which is an administrative/legal registration system, matching RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy).  
- ""都有分红"" (all have dividends) suggests some form of community or social embeddedness where dividends (economic benefits) are shared, pointing to RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

- The author states that people with city hukou (城市户口) do not receive dividends (无分红).
- Mentions that Guangzhou's old central urban area inside the old city walls from Qing dynasty times has not had villages for hundreds of years.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The mention of ""city hukou"" (城市户口) as a basis for ""dividends"" (a form of community resource or benefit) implies the author is discussing how administrative status (hukou) relates to material or social benefits, which relates to RL6 (Social Embeddedness) because of the mention of dividends and community resources.
- The reference to the old central urban area with no villages for hundreds of years implies a recognition of historical spatial boundaries and local area identity. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because it refers to historically sedimented local spatial categories.

Step 4: Output the results:

我就前几日听一个认识几年噶网友讲话有噶 话距地有一段时间全部农转居，但是都仲有分红。唔记得距系越秀定荔湾了。我都奇怪，因为我地番禺是农户先有分红,RL6,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 
- 越秀 (Yuexiu)
- 荔湾 (Liwan)
- 番禺 (Panyu)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author mentions that some area (""a certain place"") had a period where all residents converted from agricultural to urban household registration but still receive dividends.
- The author notes that in Panyu, only agricultural households receive dividends.
- The author expresses curiosity about this difference.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""农转居"" (agricultural to urban household registration) and ""分红"" (dividends) relates to social embeddedness and economic status linked to local identity.
- The fact that dividends are linked to agricultural household status suggests that the author is using the presence or absence of such dividends as a criterion for defining or evaluating ""local person"" identity or local area status.
- This matches RL6 (Social Embeddedness) because it involves community resources (dividends) and economic status as a marker of local identity.
- There is also a hint of RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy) because the agricultural to urban household registration change (hukou) is an administrative classification, but the author does not explicitly argue hukou as the defining standard but more focuses on dividends linked to household type.
- The core recognition logic the author uses seems to be RL6.

- 旧唐楼 (Old Tang Building)  
- 大东门 (Da Dong Men area)  
- 幼儿园 (kindergarten)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions their home is near 大东门, in an old Tang building.  
- The author says they attended kindergarten there and received some kind of subsidy for the building (补楼), but there were no dividends (分红).  
- The author notes there is a family genealogy (族谱), but most of the people recorded are not Chinese.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention of family genealogy (族谱) and the observation that many people listed are not Chinese implies the author is considering family lineage or ancestral roots as a factor in defining local identity. This corresponds to RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- There is no explicit or implicit indication that administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority is used by the author here to define ""local person"".  
- The mention of no dividends (分红) is a factual statement about property but does not indicate the author uses property ownership or social embeddedness as a criterion.  
- The mention of the location (大东门) is descriptive, without any evaluative or symbolic local spatial classification.  

Step 4: Output the results

我都系甘葛情况，我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 广州人 (Guangzhou people), 老西 (likely a local term or area nickname)

Step 2: The author says ""我同我老豆都系老西关系广州人但系应该唔系土著"" meaning ""My father and I are Guangzhou people with old western connections but probably not natives (土著).""

Step 3: The author distinguishes between being ""广州人"" with ""老西关系"" and ""土著"" (natives). This implies the author uses family rootedness or ancestral roots to define ""土著"" (local natives), which they do not identify as. The phrase ""应该唔系土著"" suggests the author judges local identity based on generational roots or ancestral lineage.

Step 4: Therefore, the recognized logic is RL3 (Family Rootedness).

我觉得主要是看你有没有融入当地的文化，那些说有没有村和祖屋我都觉得不一定。我家就是太公那代是从家乡迁到我们现居住城市的，我发现这边很多同一家乡的人都会自发集聚组成一条村，所以我们在这边也可以说有村子，有祠堂，也建有祖屋。我们过年过节都是按原来的家乡习俗，和本地人不一样，称呼本地人会说你们本地人，当地语言也会讲，但同村人交流还是用家乡话。所以我觉得我们没有完全融入当地文化，就不算本地人。,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- ""我家"" (my family)
- ""家乡"" (hometown)
- ""现居住城市"" (current city of residence)
- ""同一家乡的人"" (people from the same hometown)
- ""本地人"" (local people)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author argues that whether one is a local person depends mainly on whether one has integrated into the local culture.
- The author dismisses the importance of ancestral village and ancestral house as necessary criteria.
- The author notes that their family migrated from their hometown to the current city in the great-grandfather's generation.
- People from the same hometown form a self-organized village with ancestral halls and ancestral houses.
- During festivals, they follow hometown customs, different from the local people.
- They speak the local language but communicate with their own village people in their hometown dialect.
- The author concludes that since they have not fully integrated into local culture, they do not count as local people.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The core standard the author endorses for defining a local person is cultural integration (""有没有融入当地的文化"").
- The author specifically rejects lineage-based criteria (ancestral village and ancestral house).
- The author mentions language use: speaking local language but also using hometown dialect with their own group.
- The author emphasizes cultural practices and social integration as criteria.
- Therefore, the primary recognition logic is RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition), since the author uses cultural and linguistic integration as the main criterion for local identity.
- RL3 (Family Rootedness) is explicitly rejected by the author.
- RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy), RL5 (Functional Livability), RL6 (Social Embeddedness), RL7 (Occupational Typification) are not mentioned or endorsed as standards.

- Baiyun Mountain: The author mentions that several generations of ancestors are buried there, not in public cemeteries.
- Family members: The author notes that all family members speak Cantonese (粤语) without any accent.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- RL3 (Family Rootedness): The emphasis on several generations of ancestors buried on Baiyun Mountain indicates the importance of long-term family roots and generational history as a standard for defining local identity.
- RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition): The mention that all family members speak Cantonese with no accent shows linguistic-cultural recognition as a criterion for being local.

- The mention of the mother’s village and ancestral hall, combined with the father’s different origin, and the author's feeling of being ""half a Guangzhou person"" implies the author uses family historical roots (ancestry, lineage) as a standard to define local identity.
- The phrase ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) is directly cited but author still feels only half local, emphasizing the importance of family roots beyond just birthplace.
- There is no mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, occupation, social embeddedness, or functional livability.
- Thus, the core logic is RL3: Family Rootedness.

Output: RL3"
？？？我广州话有乡音，我都系广州人，去祠堂都系讲乡音,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 祠堂 (ancestral hall, culturally linked to family roots and local traditions)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author states that they have a ""乡音"" (local accent/dialect) of Guangzhou and that even when going to the ancestral hall, they speak the local dialect.
- This implies that speaking the local dialect is an important marker of being a ""local person"" in Guangzhou.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""乡音"" (local accent) as a marker of local identity corresponds to Recognition Logic 4 (RL4): Linguistic-Cultural Recognition.
- The mention of ""祠堂"" (ancestral hall) and speaking the local dialect there may also imply some link to family rootedness or cultural tradition, but the core explicit argument is about dialect.
- The core expressed standard for being a local person is speaking the local dialect.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author says their family has been here for several generations.
- The author speaks Cantonese.
- The author says they consider themselves a Guangzhou local but not a Guangzhou native (""土著""), because they are from Panyu.

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- ""家也好几代在这边"" (family several generations here) indicates Family Rootedness (RL3).
- ""讲粤语"" (speak Cantonese) indicates Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4).
- ""我是广州本地人，但不算广州土著，因为我是番禺的"" — the distinction between being a Guangzhou local and not a native due to being from Panyu (a district) suggests Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1) about intra-city spatial identity boundaries.

- 香港 (Hong Kong)
- 南洋 (Southeast Asia)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 广州城: The author states that before the Republic of China era, Guangzhou city was basically only from West Gate to Great East Gate.
- 广州土著: The author claims most natives of Guangzhou have emigrated abroad, with very few remaining; places like USA, Canada, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia have more Guangzhou natives than Guangzhou itself.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author is defining ""local person"" identity based on historical spatial boundaries of Guangzhou city (the core city area before the Republic era). This reflects a shared, historically sedimented spatial perception of what counts as Guangzhou proper, i.e., Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1).
- The mention of family history (""家族逃出去又回来"") hints at family rootedness, but the author does not explicitly use family roots as a standard to define ""local person"" identity here.
- The focus is on historical spatial boundaries and the emigration of natives, which supports RL1.
- No mention of administrative boundaries or hukou, so RL2 excluded.
- No mention of dialect or language, so RL4 excluded.
- No mention of livability or convenience, so RL5 excluded.
- No mention of social embeddedness or property, so RL6 excluded.
- No mention of occupational typification, so RL7 excluded.

- The author implies that cultural and linguistic habits are key criteria for defining who is ""more Guangzhou.""
- The author mentions ""土不土著"" (whether native or not) but implies that traditional cultural adherence is a standard for being truly local.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- Emphasis on maintaining Guangzhou language and culture, including dialect and traditional habits, as a standard to define local identity → RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).
- Reference to ""generations"" of residence → RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- No explicit mention of administrative boundaries or hukou → no RL2.

- 我妈 and others grew up in Guangzhou.
- At home, they all speak Cantonese (粤语).
- They only return to 老家 briefly during Qingming Festival.
- Despite these facts, they do not consider themselves Guangzhou people.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions that their family members grew up in Guangzhou and speak the local dialect (粤语). This indicates recognition of linguistic-cultural features as a standard for local identity.
- However, the family does not identify as Guangzhou people despite speaking Cantonese and growing up there, implying that linguistic-cultural recognition alone is insufficient.
- The mention of ""长大"" (grew up) suggests family rootedness or individual growth history is considered important.
- The refusal to identify as Guangzhou people despite these factors implies the author acknowledges family rootedness (RL3) and linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) as relevant standards for defining ""local person"".

- The author mentions ""at least five generations born and raised in Guangzhou,"" ""having dividends and land,"" and that such people are at most called 广州客家人.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""五代都在广州土生土长"" (at least five generations born and raised in Guangzhou) indicates RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of ""有分红有地"" (have dividends and land) suggests ownership of property or community economic embeddedness, which aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness).

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The mention of ""dividends"" (分红) relates to community resources or economic embeddedness.
- This aligns with RL6 (Social Embeddedness), where possession or access to community resources (like dividends) is used to define or legitimize local identity.

Step 2: The author discusses the age-related ability to speak Guangzhou dialect. The author implies that people born in the 1980s should generally speak Guangzhou dialect, while those born in the 2000s not speaking it is normal.

Step 3: The author uses the ability to speak the local dialect (Guangzhou dialect) as a criterion to distinguish locals, suggesting that speaking the dialect is part of local identity, and the generational difference affects this.

Step 4: The recognition logic corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) for the dialect criterion, and RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) because the author uses birth years and upbringing time as a criterion for local identity.

- Guangzhou (广州)
- Sydney (悉尼)
- ""abc"" (likely referring to Australian-born Chinese)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity
- Guangzhou: The author talks about classmates who moved into Guangzhou from other provinces and initially did not speak Cantonese but later became fluent with no accent. Also mentions local Guangzhou people who have lost their Cantonese fluency.
- Sydney: The author mentions many Sydney-born Chinese (abc) who speak fluent Cantonese indistinguishable from locals.
- The author is reflecting on linguistic fluency as a marker of local identity.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement
- The core argument is that speaking fluent local dialect (Cantonese) is a significant marker of being a ""local person,"" regardless of place of birth.
- The author implicitly endorses RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) as a standard for defining local identity.
- There is no explicit mention or endorsement of administrative status, family roots, or other logics.
- The mention of ""generations"" here is more about language acquisition, not family lineage.
- No mention of spatial authority, administrative legitimacy, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author asks if someone has dividends or land, implying these as criteria or indicators related to identity or status.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- Mentioning ""dividends"" and ""land"" relates to community resources and property ownership.

- 广州 (Guangzhou)
- 增城 (Zengcheng, a district in Guangzhou)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author believes that a ""local person"" in Guangzhou is someone whose ancestors have been in Guangzhou for generations and have ancestral halls (祠堂). People who have just recently registered household (入户) or are new to Guangzhou are considered ""new Guangzhou people"" (新广州人), not true locals. The author identifies themselves as a genuine local because their family roots are in Guangzhou, specifically in Zengcheng.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ancestral roots and having ancestral halls clearly aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of ""newly registered household"" (新入户) as not fully local relates to administrative legitimacy, but the author seems to contrast that with family roots, implying RL3 is the main logic here.
- No explicit mention of administrative division or hukou as a defining standard by the author themselves.
- No mention of dialect, spatial boundaries, social embeddedness, livability, or occupation.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic label:

- 增城  
- 广州  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 增城: described as ""later merged into Guangzhou"" (administrative fact).  
- 广州: The author mentions ""even those broadly called Guangzhou people are not really considered main locals, mainly those who speak Cantonese."" The author suggests that speaking Cantonese is a better criterion to call oneself a ""Guangzhou local.""  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mention that 增城 was later merged into 广州 refers to official administrative boundaries, indicating Administrative Legitimacy (RL2). However, the author does not explicitly say that this administrative status defines localness; rather, it is background information.  
- The author emphasizes ""speaking Cantonese"" as a key standard for defining who is a local, explicitly saying those who speak Cantonese ""may be more suitable to call themselves Guangzhou locals."" This is a clear endorsement of linguistic-cultural criteria. Therefore, RL4 applies.

是本地人，不是土著，还有些人在那里卜佬卜佬，分红的时候可没见你卜佬,RL6,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- ""本地人"" (local person)  
- ""土著"" (indigenous/native person)  
- ""那里"" (there, referring to a certain place, unspecified)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author claims: ""是本地人，不是土著"" (is a local person, not indigenous/native). This suggests a distinction between being a local and being an indigenous/native person.  
- ""有些人在那里卜佬卜佬，分红的时候可没见你卜佬"" roughly means ""some people are bragging there, but when it comes to dividends, you don't see them participating."" This implies that actual participation in local community benefits (like dividends) is a criterion for being considered a genuine local person.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The emphasis on participation in dividends and implied community involvement indicates the author uses economic and social embeddedness as a standard for defining a local person.  
- The author rejects the idea that merely being ""土著"" (indigenous/native) is necessary; instead, actual embeddedness and participation in community resources matter.  

Step 4: Output the results  
- This matches Recognition Logic 6 (RL6): Social Embeddedness (Depth of Social Roots and Symbolism of Economic Status), because the author links local identity to participation in community dividends and economic-social ties.  

Output: RL6"
补充一下 是光谷东感觉光谷广场那一块交通也是乱糟的,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 光谷东, 光谷广场

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author states that the traffic around 光谷广场 in 光谷东 feels chaotic.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: The author comments on traffic conditions (a functional livability factor) in 光谷东, implying an evaluation of the area's livability or quality as a local living space. This relates to RL5 (Functional Livability). However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly link this to defining who is a ""local person"" or ""local identity""—they are commenting on traffic convenience or disorder. Since the task requires the author to use standards to define ""local person"" identity or evaluate ""local"" area identity in terms of belonging, the mention of traffic disorder alone is not enough to say the author uses it as a standard for local identity.

Step 4: Conclusion: No recognition logic applies because the author does not use traffic conditions as a standard for defining local identity.

- 江岸 (Jiang'an)
- 硚口 (Qiaokou)
- 东西湖 (Dongxihu)
- 长江 (Yangtze River)
- 汉水 (Han River)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author explains that locals usually refer to Wuhan by the ""three towns"" (汉口、武昌、汉阳), which are geographic/historical divisions, rather than by the many administrative districts. The author emphasizes that the three towns are the traditional geographic concept of Wuhan, and the administrative districts are a separate, newer classification. The author supports the ""old Wuhan people"" view that the ""three towns"" are the real local spatial divisions, not the administrative districts.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author supports the ""three towns"" as the legitimate spatial categories that define local identity, rather than administrative districts.
- The author discusses the local emotional and habitual spatial perception of the city, emphasizing geographic and historical divisions over administrative boundaries.
- This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author endorses a traditional, collective local perception of intra-city spatial categories as the basis for defining local identity.

There is no mention of hukou or administrative legitimacy as a standard the author endorses (in fact, the author contrasts the ""three towns"" with administrative districts), so RL2 is excluded.

No mention of family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation as standards.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author says ""住光谷的不敢讲话鄙视链底层,"" meaning ""those living in Guanggu dare not speak, they are at the bottom of the hierarchy of disdain."" This is a statement about social hierarchy and stigma associated with living in Guanggu.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The statement implies that living in Guanggu places one at the bottom of a social or status hierarchy.
- This relates to social embeddedness and symbolic economic status, as the ""底层"" (bottom layer) and ""鄙视链"" (chain of disdain) imply social hierarchy tied to place of residence.
- The author seems to recognize or accept that living in Guanggu corresponds to a lower social status or lower local identity standing.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 6 (Social Embeddedness), as it links place of residence with social roots and symbolic economic status.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, or occupational groups.
- The author does not mention convenience or livability features.
- The focus is on social status linked to residence.

- 取水楼 (Qushuizhou)
- 江汉路 (Jianghan Road)
- 黄浦路 (Huangpu Road)
- 民众乐园 (Minzhong Leyuan)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author states that Wuhan people, especially those living in the core of Hankou, consider anything outside the Inner Ring Road as ""village"" or suburban.
- They believe that the circle around Minzhong Leyuan is the real Hankou core, the urban area, and city center.
- People who grew up in Liuduqiao, Youyi Road, Qushuizhou, Jianghan Road have a deeply rooted idea that Huangpu Road is suburban.
- There is an emphasis on local people's perception of the spatial boundaries of the city and which areas count as core local areas.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author describes a collective, habitual local perception of spatial boundaries within Wuhan/Hankou that distinguishes core areas from suburban or village areas, based on emotional and historical mapping rather than official administrative boundaries.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority.
- The text does not mention administrative divisions, hukou, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation as criteria.

- 市内: The author states that the city center no longer attracts them much.
- 蔡甸话: Speaking the Caidian dialect is associated with a sense of superiority and local identity; the author regrets their daughter not speaking it, indicating linguistic-cultural identity importance.
- 大女儿: The daughter does not speak the local dialect, which the author sees as a failure to educate her properly, implying dialect is a criterion for local identity.
- 武汉市内的年轻人: They are friendly and polite, possibly more accepting.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The core of the author's identity definition revolves around dialect use (蔡甸话) as a marker of being a ""local person"" or having local identity. The author explicitly links speaking the dialect to insider status and local pride.
- The author contrasts old local people’s sense of superiority, tied to dialect and origin.

- The author feels that 武汉人 don't quite respect people from 新洲.
- The author states that they usually consider themselves as 武汉人 based on the administrative division.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses administrative division (行政区划) as the basis for defining ""local person"" identity (whether someone is a 武汉人).

武汉已经越来越大了，现在黄陂新洲都划进来了,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 武汉, 黄陂, 新洲

Step 2: The author mentions that Wuhan has expanded, and now Huangpi and Xinzhou have been incorporated.

Step 3: The author bases the local area scope on administrative incorporation (""划进来了"" - ""have been incorporated""), implying that the administrative division is a standard for defining the local area.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic labels.

家里人是武钢的，记得小时候，一些武昌的亲戚一边羡慕我家人的“铁饭碗”一边嘲笑我是乡里伢。,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities: 武钢 (Wugang), 武昌 (Wuchang)

Step 2: The author mentions family members working at 武钢 and that some relatives from 武昌 both admire the ""iron rice bowl"" (stable job) of the author's family and mock the author as a ""乡里伢"" (a rural/local kid).

Step 3: The author implies that being from 武钢 (a steel plant or company) family and having stable jobs (""铁饭碗"") is a point of recognition or identity, but also contrasts with being mocked as a ""乡里伢,"" which suggests a local or rural identity. The author does not explicitly reject or accept these standards but presents them as social recognition. The mention of family origin and relatives' views suggests a family-rootedness recognition logic.

The ""乡里伢"" term relates to local or rural origin, implying family rootedness (RL3). The ""铁饭碗"" relates to occupational type but is mentioned by others, not the author endorsing it as a local identity standard. The author mainly refers to family background as a basis for identity.

Therefore, the core logic is RL3: Family Rootedness.

Output: RL3"

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 老武汉人: They feel many places are still considered rural (乡里), which is a long-standing impression that cannot be changed easily.
- 青山区东北人后代: The author identifies themselves as a native-born descendant from northeast Qingshan District.
- 汉口人: Many Hankou people consider the author's area as remote or peripheral.
- 周边: The author believes people from surrounding areas are not authentic Wuhan locals.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author identifies as 土生土长 (born and raised locally), which is a family rootedness/growth history marker → RL3.
- The mention that many Hankou people consider the author's area as偏僻地方 (remote area) and the old Wuhan people consider many places as乡里 (rural areas), a long-standing spatial perception that does not align with administrative boundaries but emotional/cultural perception → RL1.
- The author also evaluates 周边 (surrounding areas) as ""not authentic locals,"" reflecting a boundary based on local perceptions of space and identity → RL1.

Step 4: Output the result.

不是，武汉主城区是口音辨别的。只要不是地道汉口话才说是乡里的。黄陂的发音跟武汉人是不一样,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 武汉主城区, 汉口话, 黄陂

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that the ""local person"" identity in Wuhan main urban area is judged by accent (""口音辨别"").
- If someone does not speak authentic Hankou dialect (""地道汉口话""), they are considered ""乡里"" (outsiders).
- The pronunciation in Huangpi (""黄陂"") differs from that of Wuhan people.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author uses dialect/accent as a criterion for distinguishing locals from outsiders.
- This corresponds to RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition).

"武汉13个区的GDP排名、未来发展、人口以及房价情况一直备受关注。外地人常认为汉口区是武汉最富有的区，实际上他们说的是江汉区。江汉路步行街、国广武广每日都在刷新武汉的最高消费记录，西北湖的金融圈也是高楼林立。不过，江汉区2024年GDP仅1627亿，在武汉排名第六，房价约15000到3万之间。
 江岸区的万国建筑群江滩是武汉最顶级的富人区，二七滨江也坐落于此。这里的文化气息浓郁，人们可以在老洋房拍照打卡、在汉口江滩漫步、在武汉关跨年，武汉人的美好记忆都与之相关。其教育水平在武汉位居第二，发展潜力巨大。然而，2024年江岸区的GDP为1625亿，略低于江汉区。房价两极分化严重，最高的一万出头，最贵的八九万。
 真正能打的其实是东湖高新区，也就是中国光谷。它是举全省之力发展的板块，2024年GDP达到2715亿，增速4.7%，连续多年位居武汉第一。这里汇聚了大批高端产业，如互联网、人工智能、生物医药、数字通信等。光谷中心城道路宽敞、高楼林立，科技感十足。每天诞生六十多个老板、120多个企业，十多个发明专利。人均收入达20万，研究生、博士生遍地走，企业高管、科技新贵年入百万，身价千万上亿也很平常。虽然房价高峰期达到3万，现在跌到了17000平，但作为全武汉年轻人和外来人口最多的新区，这样的房价在很多人看来并不贵。
 再说说最穷的区，汉阳区常被认为是武汉最穷的区。其2024年GDP只有260亿，在主城区垫底，钟家村王家湾的商业也日渐衰落。不过汉阳区有着丰富的旅游资源、风景、文化和宜居环境，像晴川历历汉阳区、芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲的美景，每年大年初五都人山人海。
 蔡甸区连续多年GDP垫底，2024年GDP仅529亿。中华新城彻底熄火，老城区缺乏足够生活气息，产业和人口状况都较为一般。花博会期间稍微热闹点，板块内基本都是养老之地，房子每平五六千，与周边8加1城市圈的县城水平相当。
 武汉正处于两极分化的关键节点，只有基本面良好、产业发达的板块才能吸引更多人才流入，而人口不断流失的板块必然会逐渐失去竞争力，房价下跌也在所难免。","RL4, RL5","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text:

- 武汉 (Wuhan overall)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 江汉区: described as a wealthy district, with high consumption areas (Jianghan Road pedestrian street, Guoguang Wuguang), financial district; 2024 GDP rank 6th in Wuhan; house prices 15000-30000.
- 江岸区: described as a top wealthy district with cultural atmosphere, education ranked second in Wuhan, high development potential; 2024 GDP slightly lower than Jianghan; house prices highly polarized (10,000+ to 80,000+).
- 东湖高新区: highest GDP in Wuhan, high growth rate, gathering high-end industries, high income, high education level, many high-value entrepreneurs; house prices peaked at 30,000, now dropped to 17,000; considered an attractive area especially for youth and migrants.
- 汉阳区: considered the poorest district, GDP lowest in main city, declining commerce; but rich in tourism, culture, and livability.
- 蔡甸区: GDP lowest for years, old city lacks life, mainly elderly housing, low house prices comparable to nearby counties.
- Wuhan overall: experiencing polarization; only districts with good fundamentals and developed industries attract talent; districts losing population lose competitiveness and housing prices fall.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement:
- The author uses GDP rankings, economic development, industry presence, education level, and income levels to evaluate and distinguish districts. This is mostly economic and functional evaluation.
- The author also discusses cultural atmosphere and historical memory for Jiang'an District, linking it to identity and localness.
- The author mentions population flows, talent attraction, and housing prices to explain district competitiveness and desirability.
- The author contrasts ""rich"" and ""poor"" districts based on economic and social development indicators.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use administrative boundaries or hukou status to define ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not mention dialect, family roots, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as criteria for defining ""local person.""
- The author mentions cultural atmosphere (江岸区) and ""Wuhan people's beautiful memories"" linked to that district, which suggests some cultural recognition logic.
- The author uses spatial perceptions about which districts are wealthy or poor, but these are official districts, not vernacular or emotional spatial categories outside administrative boundaries.
- The author evaluates districts based on functional livability factors: economic development, education, income, housing price, tourism and environment.
- The author discusses cultural atmosphere and memories for 江岸区, indicating some cultural-linguistic or cultural recognition, but dialect or language is not mentioned.
- Overall, the main recognition logics supported are RL5 (Functional Livability) and partially RL4 (Linguistic-Cultural Recognition) for cultural atmosphere.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements matched: The author recalls xyl saying ""土生土长的水果湖人"" (""native-born Fruit Lake people"").

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The phrase ""土生土长"" (native-born, born and raised locally) indicates emphasis on family rootedness and local growth history.
- This aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness), as it defines local identity based on being born and raised in the area.

gdp 再高，跟汉南人有关系？,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""汉南人"" (Hannan people)

Step 2: The text questions the relevance of GDP (economic output) to the identity of Hannan people.

Step 3: The author implies that economic indicators like GDP do not determine local identity. The author challenges the association of economic status with being a local person.

Step 4: Since the author resists using economic measures (wealth, GDP) as a criterion for local identity, and does not propose any positive recognition logic, no RL category applies.

- Wuhan (大城市武汉)  
- ""Old city residents"" (老市民)  
- ""Outsiders from rural areas"" (祖辈都在乡下耕田的外地人)

- The author talks about ""old city residents"" whose ancestors have been in Wuhan for generations but have not reached the upper class, feeling a psychological gap or loss when outsiders (from rural areas) come and achieve social parity or even surpass them.  
- The author mentions that only exclusion (排外) can somewhat uphold the dignity of old city residents.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author emphasizes ""祖祖辈辈都是大城市武汉人"" (ancestors for many generations being Wuhan people) as a basis for local identity. This is a clear reference to family rootedness and generational depth of family settlement.  
- The contrast with outsiders from rural areas who came later and are treated as non-locals shows the importance of family historical roots.  
- The mention of social status (""还没到大城市上层"", ""混得比自己还好"") is descriptive of social hierarchy but the author does not endorse social status as a standard for defining local identity; rather, the local identity is anchored in family roots.  
- The exclusion (排外) is a reaction to perceived threats to identity but does not constitute a recognition logic itself.

- 经开 (Economic Development Zone)
- 汉南 (Hannan District)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states that they used to live in 经开, their records (档案) list 经开 as their location, but later 经开 was merged into 汉南, which confuses them.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author references administrative changes (merging of districts) and uses the official location on their records as an identity marker.
- This reflects an appeal to official administrative divisions and legal status to define locality.
- Therefore, this is an example of Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy).

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author identifies as a ""土生土长的武汉人"" (born and raised Wuhan local), implying RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The author states 20 years ago 汉口 was the wealthiest place in Wuhan, now 光谷 develops very fast and is good.
- Many people living in the city center move to 光谷 to work.
- The author believes Wuhan's future depends on 光谷.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The self-identification as ""土生土长的武汉人"" indicates RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of 汉口 and 光谷 development and people moving to 光谷 to work is about economic development and urban functional livability, but the author does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define ""local person"" identity.
- The author does not use administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority as identity criteria here.

- 黄陂 is described as stronger, with the airport, booming logistics and cultural tourism markets, and two subway lines.
- 新洲 is described as only having a remote, distant small mountain village left after Yangluo is ""cut off"" (剁).
- The author evaluates 黄陂 as a more developed, accessible, and lively area compared to 新洲.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses infrastructure and convenience (airport, subway lines, booming markets) as criteria to judge the value or quality of these areas.
- The comparison emphasizes functional livability and convenience of living functions.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, or social embeddedness.
- The author seems to implicitly consider 黄陂 more ""local"" or better as a local area due to these features.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that currently Haicang, Jimei, and Tongan belong to Xiamen area, but historically, Xiamen belonged to them, not vice versa.
- Historically, Xiamen only referred to the old city area around Zhongshan Road, where the city center was.
- For Xiamen locals, Xiang'an is considered part of Tongan.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes historical and collective local perceptions about which areas are considered ""Xiamen"" or part of it.
- The distinctions are not based on current administrative boundaries but on historical and local cognitive maps.
- The mention of ""historically Xiamen only meant the old city area"" and ""Xiang'an is considered part of Tongan by locals"" reflects vernacular spatial authority.

经济特区一开始只有湖里的一小部分好像，当时厦门岛还分4个区，经济特区扩大到全岛，后来建设海湾型城市，把集美，海沧，同安，翔安，并到厦门市，就把岛内的鼓浪屿区和开元区合并到思明区了。所以并不是有些人说的什么“集美同安为什么就不是厦门”“你们是在优越什么”，而是人家集美就有自己的名字，那么多年人家就是集美人，灌口人，这样的由来。海湾型城市之后就是岛内外6个区了。,"Output: Recognition Logic 1, Recognition Logic 2","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:

- 厦门市 (Xiamen City)
- 鼓浪屿区 (Gulangyu District)
- 开元区 (Kaiyuan District)
- 思明区 (Siming District)
- 灌口 (Guankou)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The text discusses the historical administrative changes of Xiamen Island and surrounding districts.
- It explains that the Special Economic Zone initially covered only a small part of Huli.
- The SEZ expanded to the entire island.
- The city was built into a ""bay-type city"" by incorporating Jimei, Haicang, Tongan, Xiang'an into Xiamen City.
- The island's districts Gulangyu and Kaiyuan were merged into Siming District.
- The author argues against the claim ""Why are Jimei and Tongan not part of Xiamen?"" and ""You are being arrogant,"" stating that Jimei and Guankou have their own names and identities, and have been known as Jimei people and Guankou people for many years.
- After the bay-type city construction, the city has 6 districts inside and outside the island.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes the historical and administrative evolution of the city boundaries and districts.
- The mention of merging districts and expanding the SEZ to cover the entire island relates to **official administrative divisions**.
- The author stresses that Jimei and Guankou have their own names and identities formed over many years, which points to recognition of **historical local identity based on place names and collective identity**.
- The author disputes a viewpoint that questions whether Jimei and Tongan belong to Xiamen, implying that local identity is tied to these named areas, their historical identity, and longstanding local recognition.
- This corresponds to **Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** because the author uses the idea of local place names and their historical recognition to define local identity.
- The description of district mergers and SEZ expansions also invokes **Recognition Logic 2 (Administrative Legitimacy)** since the author references official city administrative restructuring and boundaries to define locality.
- There is no mention of family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification.

好家伙 我以为厦门岛内房价应该不会太高 想着看看 结果一看 嗯～跟上海也差不多,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities: 厦门岛内, 上海

Step 2: The author is comparing housing prices in 厦门岛内 to those in 上海, noting that the prices are similarly high.

Step 3: The author is focusing on housing prices (房价) as an indicator. However, this mention is about the cost of living or wealth level, not explicitly about defining who is a local person or the identity of the area. There is no indication that the author uses housing price as a criterion for defining ""local person"" identity or the local area’s boundaries or identity.

Step 4: Therefore, no recognition logic applies here.

- The author states that when they were young, only a certain area was considered ""厦门"" (Xiamen), and other areas were called ""岛外"" (outside the island).
- Now, with resource expansion, the understanding of ""厦门"" has become broader.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses how the spatial understanding or cognitive boundary of ""厦门"" has changed over time, reflecting a collective or habitual perception of what counts as ""local"" Xiamen.
- This corresponds to Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, since the author is describing local, habitual perceptions of city boundaries and how they have evolved.

- 福州: Mentioned as a comparison point for salaries (lower than Xiamen).
- 香港: Mentioned as a place where the author has studied and stayed for some years.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions ""厦门本地人只要在厦门有房子"" (local people who have property in Xiamen), implying that owning property is a marker of local identity or at least linked to local people. This points toward RL6 (Social Embeddedness).
- The author emphasizes the quality of urban functions like education, transportation, medical care, environment, and population size, describing Xiamen as a very good city with these features. This reflects RL5 (Functional Livability).
- The mention of salaries in state-owned enterprises and civil servants being higher than in Fuzhou, and that many locals want to return to work in Xiamen, may imply a social-occupational dimension but is more about economic conditions than identity definition, so no RL7.

Step 2: The author mentions that the housing prices in 厦门 are driven up by wealthy businessmen from the neighboring district (隔壁市区).  
Step 3: The statement talks about wealth influence on housing prices but does not indicate that the author uses this as a standard to define who is a ""local person"" or to evaluate ""local"" identity. It is a description of economic activity, not a recognition logic for local identity.  
Step 4: No recognition logic matches the author's own definition of local identity here.

Output:","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: None specific.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities: The text complains about traffic congestion, parking difficulty, and high housing prices.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic: The author mentions negative aspects of urban living conditions but does not explicitly or implicitly state these as standards to define ""local person"" identity or the scope/quality of a local area. It is a general complaint, not an identity definition.

Step 4: Output results: No recognition logic categories apply.

Output:"

- 青秀区: author and classmates were born and raised there, no perceived difference.
- 乡镇: some township people who moved in after high school show a sense of superiority.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes ""土生土长从小到大"" (born and raised locally from childhood to adulthood) as the basis for identity, implying RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- The author contrasts this with newcomers (from townships), who show ""优越感"" (superiority), but this is a negative evaluation and does not endorse the newcomers' standard.

- 埌西: Mentioned as the author's childhood place.
- 西乡塘: The author's classmates from this area thought the author's family was poor.
- 东盟商务区: The author bought a house here some years later, noting the price was only a few thousand yuan per square meter.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author mentions the past rural status of 青秀区 and the classmates' perception of poverty but does not explicitly or implicitly use these as standards to define ""local person"" identity.
- The mention of house price in 东盟商务区 relates to affordability but does not indicate the author uses this as a criterion to define who is local.
- The text focuses on socio-economic status and housing prices, but no explicit or implicit claim that these are standards for defining ""local person"" identity.
- No mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational types, or vernacular spatial authority is used as a standard.

Step 2: The author talks about 青秀区土著 (locals of Qingxiu District) and mentions their own childhood experience near 医科大, having to go to 朝阳西 or 西乡塘 to play or shop.

Step 3: The author seems to imply that 青秀区 locals do not have a special superiority (""能有啥优越感啊""), suggesting a critique of local identity claims based on the district. The mention of going to other areas for activities suggests the author views local identity not strictly tied to the specific district boundaries but more about habitual social or spatial practices.

This suggests the author uses a spatial or habitual perception of local areas to evaluate local identity, which aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation typification as identity standards.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author implies that authentic locals have a shared recognition of Chaoyang Square as a positive or important place, despite its crowded and mixed nature.
- The phrase ""正宗南宁人"" (authentic Nanning locals) suggests a group identity based on being truly local.
- The statement implies a local collective recognition or emotional map about the area.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- 西乡塘: described as having many ""城中村"" (urban villages), mixed old and new buildings, not as newly constructed as 青秀 and 五象, but crowded and lively.
- 朝阳广场附近地铁站: multiple stations in urban villages, convenient for living because of proximity to zoo, train station, and Chaoyang.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author discusses spatial characteristics and qualities of these areas, contrasting old urban villages with newly built areas. The focus is on the physical and functional aspects of the area (building age, liveliness, convenience).
- The author explicitly links convenience of living (close to transit, amenities) as a positive attribute for living in these areas.
- There is no mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation types.
- The author does not discuss who is a ""local person"" directly, nor use hukou or family roots or dialect as criteria.
- The author implicitly evaluates the ""local area"" by its functional livability (convenience, liveliness).
- Therefore, the recognized logic is RL5 (Functional Livability).

不同区域的街头人群确实迥异，我来南宁生活十多年了，住的地方人流量相对低，平常上班下班很少逛街，最多去去附近万象城盛天地之类的。某次突发奇想坐地铁去朝阳广场（几年没去了），总记得那次的感觉。出地铁看到密密麻麻的人群，都还是年轻人居多，感觉城市非常有朝气，觉得很开心。,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 南宁 (Nanning)
- 万象城 (MixC)
- 盛天地 (Sheng Tiandi)
- 朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author talks about different street crowds in different areas, noting that where they live has relatively low pedestrian flow, and they rarely go out except to nearby shopping centers. The author then describes a visit to Chaoyang Square with a dense crowd mostly of young people, feeling the city is energetic and happy.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author describes different areas by their crowd characteristics and atmosphere.
- The author expresses a feeling of the city’s vitality based on the crowd and environment of Chaoyang Square.
- The text reflects an evaluation of areas based on livability or functional convenience (e.g., pedestrian flow, vibrancy).
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly define ""local person"" identity or who counts as a local based on these observations.
- The author does not mention administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupation.
- The author does not indicate that these factors are standards to judge local identity.
- Therefore, although the author evaluates areas, this is not about defining who is a local person.

别搞青秀区全区，我寻思着小时候住星湖路的从来没说过别的地方破，毕竟我们自己的房子也挺破。,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities: 青秀区, 星湖路  
Step 2: The author talks about 青秀区 (Qingxiu District) and 星湖路 (Xinghu Road). The author expresses a view about their childhood residence at 星湖路 and mentions the quality of their own house (破, broken/old). The author seems to reject the notion of disparaging other parts of 青秀区, implying a local perspective tied to lived experience in a specific area.  
Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:  
- The author refers to their own childhood residence and the condition of their house as a basis for their perspective on the area, which suggests a family rootedness or individual growth history in the locality. This fits RL3 (Family Rootedness).  
- There is also an implied local spatial perception about the district and its parts, but the author does not explicitly define or endorse the spatial boundaries or symbolic meaning of the area beyond their personal experience, so RL1 is not strongly supported.  
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as defining local identity.

- 某桥底下
- 小学伙伴爷爷奶奶家（具体位置不详）
- 山旮旯建政路那一代（作者的成长地）

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- 青秀区 and 江南区某穷小区: The author mentions people there have ""优越感"" (a sense of superiority).
- 亭洪供电局下来一点，某桥底下: The author's childhood friend's grandparents live there.
- The old lady claims ""我们家是南宁本地人哦"" (our family are locals of Nanning).
- The author perceives this claim as laughable and ""井底之蛙优越感"" (narrow-minded superiority), especially when compared to their own ""山旮旯建政路那一代"" upbringing.
- The author feels that the old lady's claim of being ""本地人"" (local person) is questionable given the poor condition of the neighborhood (""那个小区有多烂"").

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The old lady claims local identity based on family rootedness (""我们家是南宁本地人哦"") which implies a RL3 logic: defining local person by family roots or long-term settlement.
- The author challenges this claim by comparing living environment quality (""小区有多烂"") but the author’s main focus is on mocking the narrow-mindedness of the claim, not explicitly endorsing RL5 (livability) as a standard.
- The author mentions ""山旮旯建政路那一代"" as their own origin, implying that being born and raised in that area (RL3) is a more authentic standard.
- There is no explicit mention of administrative legitimacy (RL2), vernacular spatial authority (RL1), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as standards the author agrees with.

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- The author states that as a native of 南宁, when they were young, they liked to meet friends at 朝阳.
- As they grew older, they had more choices of places to go.
- 朝阳 became harder to park at, so they went less often.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:
- The author identifies themselves as a ""本南宁人"" (a native of Nanning), which reflects a family rootedness or growth history aspect.
- The mention of liking to meet friends at 朝阳 when young suggests a habitual, vernacular spatial perception of 朝阳 as a local place.
- The difficulty parking and changing choices reflect livability or convenience, but the author does not link these factors to defining who is a local person or the identity of local people.
- The core identity claim is ""本南宁人"" (native of Nanning), which aligns with RL3 (Family Rootedness).
- The mention of 朝阳 as a habitual meeting place for locals when young implies RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).

早期南宁各类资本大佬聚会碰头也是在朝阳的 那时候南宁不大的 以朝阳为圆心 以前的老万国酒楼就是那些大老板谈生意地方喽,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 南宁, 朝阳, 老万国酒楼

Step 2: The author states that early on, various capital tycoons in 南宁 gathered at 朝阳, specifically at 老万国酒楼, to discuss business.

Step 3: The author is indicating 朝阳 as a core local area where important social interactions among local elites took place. This implies an emotional or symbolic recognition of 朝阳 as a center of local business and social life. The author uses the spatial location (朝阳 as the circle center) to define or recognize the local ""core"" area.

This aligns with Recognition Logic 1 (RL1): Vernacular Spatial Authority, where local perceptions of spatial categories define local identity.

No mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification as identity standards.

Output: RL1"
哈哈哈我西乡塘农村的，我小时候去朝阳广场我也怕，特别是过天桥和地下通道的时候，就是有很多乞丐在那里然后会害怕,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 西乡塘农村 (Xixiangtang rural area)
- 朝阳广场 (Chaoyang Square)
- 天桥和地下通道 (overpass and underpass)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author identifies themselves as from ""西乡塘农村"" (a rural area).
- The author recalls childhood fear when going to ""朝阳广场,"" especially crossing overpass and underpass, due to many beggars there.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author self-identifies as from a rural area, which suggests a family rootedness or growth history aspect (RL3) because mentioning ""我西乡塘农村的"" implies a place of origin or family roots.
- However, the author does not explicitly or implicitly use this as a standard to define who is a local person.
- The mention of fear at ""朝阳广场"" with many beggars is a personal experience related to environment but not a standard for defining ""local person.""
- No mention of administrative legitimacy, vernacular spatial authority, linguistic-cultural recognition, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or functional livability as a basis for defining ""local person.""

Step 4: Final judgment:
- The author simply states their origin (rural area), but does not explicitly or implicitly state that this origin is a standard for defining local identity.
- The fear of beggars is a personal experience, not a standard for local identity.
- Therefore, no recognition logic categories apply.

Output: RL1","Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 南宁 (Nanning), 青秀区 (Qingxiu District)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states they are also from Nanning but not from Qingxiu District.
- The author questions the special status of Qingxiu District, implying skepticism about its elevated identity.
- Mentions ""房价多少啊？"" (What about the housing prices?), possibly implying questioning if housing prices confer local status.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author implicitly questions the elevated status of Qingxiu District as a ""local"" area, which relates to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), since the author challenges the idea that Qingxiu District is a special or core ""local"" area.
- The mention of housing prices could be related to RL6 (Social Embeddedness) if the author uses property ownership or value as a criterion for local identity. However, here the question is rhetorical and seems to challenge the importance of housing prices rather than endorse it as a standard.
- The author does not explicitly endorse administrative legitimacy (RL2), family roots (RL3), linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4), livability (RL5), or occupational typification (RL7).
- The author’s main point is to question the assumed elevated status of Qingxiu District as a local identity marker, which relates to RL1.

- France/French people (""法国人"")  
- Southeast Asians (""东南亚人"")  
- ASEAN Business District (""东盟商务区"")  
- Nanning (""南宁"")  

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:  
- The author says French people look at Southeast Asians (specifically in the ASEAN Business District) as if they were colonial subjects, which the author finds laughable.  
- The author identifies themself as a native-born Nanning person (""土生土长南宁人"").  

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author explicitly states their local identity by saying ""土生土长南宁人"" (born and raised in Nanning). This is a direct reference to RL3: Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History.  
- The mention of ""东盟商务区"" as a place where French people look at Southeast Asians in a colonial manner is more of a social observation and does not indicate the author uses administrative boundaries or spatial perceptions to define ""local person.""  
- No mention of administrative legitimacy (RL2), vernacular spatial authority (RL1), dialect/culture (RL4), livability (RL5), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7) as identity standards.

本广西人现在是“地铁老人脸”。这都还没富起来呢，就开始拿起贵族姿态了我们偏远农村的广西人看来只能下广东或者出国了。不配奢望首府,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 广西 (Guangxi)  
- 广东 (Guangdong)  
- 首府 (capital city)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author identifies as a person from Guangxi (""本广西人"").  
- The author mentions ""地铁老人脸"" (literally ""metro old face,"" likely referring to long-term residents near metro lines or a certain urban insider group).  
- The author criticizes the attitude of some people who have not yet become wealthy but already act like nobles, implying a social or identity distinction.  
- The author contrasts themselves and other ""偏远农村的广西人"" (rural Guangxi people) who can only go to Guangdong or abroad, implying they do not belong or are not accepted in the capital city.  
- The phrase ""不配奢望首府"" (not worthy to hope for the capital city) suggests exclusion from the local identity of the capital city.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author uses regional origin (Guangxi vs. Guangdong or capital city) as a criterion to judge who is ""local"" or belongs to the capital city. This is a kind of **Administrative Legitimacy** or regional belonging standard. However, the author does not explicitly mention hukou or official administrative status, so RL2 is weak or absent.  
- The author contrasts ""地铁老人脸"" (likely a group defined by long-term urban residence or insider status) with ""偏远农村的广西人,"" implying a social or local insider vs. outsider distinction based on origin and length of residence. This could be interpreted as **Family Rootedness (RL3)** or social embeddedness (RL6), but the text does not mention family roots or property or social networks explicitly.  
- The author emphasizes geographic origin and social identity, but the main logic is about belonging or exclusion based on place of origin and local status. This aligns with **Recognition Logic 1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority)** because the author implies that ""locals"" are those recognized insiders (like ""地铁老人脸""), and ""rural Guangxi people"" are outsiders who cannot hope to be locals of the capital. The use of ""首府"" as a local identity marker is a vernacular spatial boundary.  
- No mention of dialect or linguistic cultural recognition (RL4), no mention of livability or infrastructure (RL5), no mention of occupational typification (RL7).  
- The ""贵族姿态"" (noble posture) critique is a social attitude, but not a recognition logic standard for defining local identity.

- 老城区 (old city area)
- 五象 (Wuxiang)
- 南宁大桥头 (Nanning Bridgehead)
- 青秀 (Qingxiu)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- 老城区: The author mentions the ""土著"" (locals/native people) have a deep attachment to the old city area because it is where they grew up and lived/studied from childhood.
- 五象: The author lives here, near the Nanning Bridgehead.
- 青秀: On the other side of the bridge, with a short commute (5 minutes).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- For 老城区: The author suggests that the locals’ attachment is because it is the place where they grew up and studied, implying family rootedness or individual growth history as a basis for defining locals.
- The commuting time difference and habit relates to convenience but is more about personal adaptation rather than defining local identity.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority.
- The core logic for defining locals here is about having grown up in the area, i.e., RL3 Family Rootedness.

- 青秀区 (Qingxiu District)
- 单位集资房 (unit collective-funded housing)
- 我爸 (my father)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author mentions owning two houses in Qingxiu District.
- The specific house is a unit collective-funded house with shares and dividends.
- The house size is determined by professional title rank.
- The father supports buying because of these benefits.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes ownership of property with shares and dividends in a local area.
- The mention of shares, dividends, and property size linked to professional rank implies social embeddedness and material-symbolic resources.
- This suggests that property ownership and associated social resources contribute to defining local identity or local status.
- There is no mention of administrative legitimacy, family roots, dialect, or vernacular spatial authority.
- No direct mention of livability or occupational typification.
- Therefore, the logic is Social Embeddedness (RL6).

- 单位宿舍 (work unit dormitory)
- 商业小区 (commercial residential community)
- 老城区 (old city area)
- 琅东村 (Langdong village)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that they are used to living in a work unit dormitory and are not accustomed to living in commercial residential communities.
- When wanting to eat, especially late-night snacks, they have to go back to the old city area, sometimes driving half an hour.
- Recently, the author took their child back to their maternal home to stay, so they can go to Langdong village for food tonight.

Step 3: Analyze the recognition logic behind each viewpoint:
- The author is expressing a lifestyle/habitual spatial preference: used to living in a certain type of place (单位宿舍), and when seeking food, they go back to 老城区 and 琅东村, which seem to be recognized as places with certain local meaning or cultural value.
- This suggests a vernacular spatial authority (RL1), because the author recognizes the old city area and Langdong village as authentic or meaningful local places to eat and live, rather than the commercial residential areas.
- There is also an implicit notion of cultural-linguistic or cultural recognition (RL4), since the author is emphasizing habitual living and local food habits.
- However, the text does not mention administrative legitimacy (RL2), family rootedness (RL3), social embeddedness (RL6), or occupational typification (RL7).
- The mention of the difficulty of living in commercial residential areas is more about convenience or habit, but not explicitly about livability standards (RL5) or identity definition.

Step 2: The author describes the experience of getting off at 五象湖地铁站 and feeling like they have left the city and entered a remote area with little life atmosphere, indicating a judgment about the livability or urban quality of the area.

Step 3: The viewpoint focuses on the convenience and livability of the area (lack of life atmosphere, long walk to get a sense of living), which corresponds to Recognition Logic 5 (Functional Livability).

Step 4: Output the results.

南宁大桥头，那个位置好好，就是早晚高峰过桥很崩溃,RL5,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 南宁大桥头 (Nanning Bridgehead)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that ""那个位置好好"" (that location is very good), but ""早晚高峰过桥很崩溃"" (crossing the bridge during rush hour is very frustrating).

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates the area based on traffic convenience and experience (rush hour congestion).
- The mention of ""那个位置好好"" (that location is very good) and the negative impact of rush hour traffic implies an evaluation based on livability or functional convenience.
- No mention of administrative boundaries, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational types, or vernacular spatial authority is present.
- Therefore, the relevant recognition logic is RL5 (Functional Livability).

Step 4: Output the result.

- 医科大 (Medical University)  
- 五象蟠龙 (Wuxiang Panlong)  
- 武鸣校区 (Wuming Campus)  
- 被服厂 (Clothing Factory)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 医科大: Has collective-funded housing in 五象蟠龙.  
- 武鸣校区: Was supposed to have collective-funded housing nearby, but due to no subway access, the family decided not to pursue it.  
- 被服厂: The author questions why to go there; no known involvement.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
The author discusses housing locations and accessibility (presence or absence of subway) as reasons for acceptance or rejection of collective-funded housing. The mention of collective-funded housing and subway access relates to evaluation of living function convenience and environment quality. The author’s family’s decision not to accept housing near 武鸣校区 due to lack of subway suggests an implicit endorsement of RL5 (Functional Livability) as a criterion influencing local living choices, which may relate to defining or evaluating ""local"" living areas.

No mention of hukou, dialect, family roots, social embeddedness, occupational typification, or vernacular spatial authority is evident. The author does not explicitly link hukou or administrative legitimacy, nor does the text discuss identity rootedness or linguistic markers. The focus is on the material functional convenience (subway access) and collective-funded housing location.

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author mentions having lived in 五象 for 6 years and likes the environment there.
- Describes the environment: wide roads without traffic jams, good air quality, possibility to stroll by the river in the evening.
- Mentions convenience of eating and shopping in 宜家, 万象汇, 总部基地, and that 山姆 is only 20 minutes away.
- Compares with 市区, which is described as always congested.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author evaluates the area based on environmental quality (quietness, good air), infrastructure (wide roads, no traffic jams), and convenience of living functions (shopping, eating).
- These are features related to Functional Livability (RL5).
- There is no mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, social embeddedness, occupational groups, or vernacular spatial authority.
- The author uses these living-function-related standards to implicitly define the area as preferable or ""good local"" living space.

大院长大，搬出大院，买到新的房，许多南宁人的轨迹也差不多是这样，再回到大院住也没曾经的的感觉，不符合现在的邻里关系了。老城区固然好，过去的终将也是过去了,RL3,"Step 1: Identify named entities  
- 大院 (the ""compound"" or ""work unit compound"")  
- 南宁 (Nanning)  
- 老城区 (old city district)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 大院: The author talks about growing up in the 大院, moving out, buying new houses, and that returning to the 大院 no longer feels the same, not fitting current neighborhood relations.  
- 南宁人: The author mentions that many Nanning people's trajectories are similar (growing up in the 大院, moving out, buying new houses).  
- 老城区: The author says the old city district is good, but the past is past.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic  
- The author describes a generational or life-stage trajectory: growing up in a place (大院), moving out, buying a house elsewhere, and the change in neighborhood relations. This implies a recognition logic related to family rootedness or growth history, as ""growing up in 大院"" is important to the local identity. The statement ""再回到大院住也没曾经的的感觉，不符合现在的邻里关系了"" implies that the social embeddedness or community relations have changed, but the key identity anchor is the childhood or upbringing in 大院.  
- The author values the old city district (老城区) but accepts that the past is gone, indicating a recognition of historical local roots.  

The key recognition logic is RL3 (Family Rootedness), focusing on growth history and family roots. There is also a hint of RL6 (Social Embeddedness) regarding neighborhood relations changing, but the author does not explicitly endorse social embeddedness as a criterion for defining local person identity; rather, the author laments the changed neighborhood relations. So RL6 is not clearly endorsed as a standard for local identity.  

No administrative legitimacy (RL2), vernacular spatial authority (RL1), or linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4) is mentioned. Functional livability (RL5) and occupational typification (RL7) are not discussed as defining local identity.

因为渝中的拆迁户基本上都在李家沱,N/A,"Step 1: Named entities: 渝中 (Yuzhong), 李家沱 (Lijiatuo)

Step 2: The author states that the demolition households from Yuzhong are basically all in Lijiatuo.

Step 3: The author is indicating a spatial relation between Yuzhong and Lijiatuo, implying some recognition of spatial identity or area classification. However, the statement does not explicitly or implicitly define who is a local person or the criteria of local identity. It merely states a fact about relocation.

No recognition logic for defining ""local person"" is identified.

Output:"
不会吧渝中区的拆迁户跑李家沱去干撒子，,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 渝中区 (Yuzhong District)  
- 李家沱 (Lijiatuo)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author mentions that the demolition households from 渝中区 would not go to 李家沱 to do something (干撒子). The implication is that people from 渝中区 and 李家沱 are distinct in some way, and the author is expressing skepticism about people from a central area (渝中区) moving to a more peripheral area (李家沱). This suggests a perceived difference in spatial or social identity between these places.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
The author implies that people from 渝中区 are distinct from those in 李家沱, and that moving from one to the other is unlikely or unusual. This reflects a spatial classification of local areas with different social or symbolic status, not necessarily based on administrative boundaries but on perceived area distinctions. This fits the Vernacular Spatial Authority logic (RL1).

No explicit mention of administrative legitimacy, family rootedness, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupational typification is present.

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author mentions their father has a code 510203 (likely administrative code of a place)  
- The author themselves has code 500104  
- The author claims ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) of ""ddk"" (presumably themselves)  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The use of codes 510203 and 500104 suggests administrative divisions or hukou locations, implying the author considers administrative legitimacy as a standard.  
- The phrase ""土生土长"" (born and raised) indicates family rootedness or personal growth history as a basis for local identity.

- 金山大道: Used as a spatial marker dividing ""wilderness"" from urban.
- 七星岗: The author currently lives here.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:

- The family’s perception of what counts as the core urban area (解放碑, 大坪) versus what is considered wilderness (照母山 beyond 金山大道) reflects a shared habitual, emotional spatial cognition that is not based on administrative boundaries but on local collective perception and symbolic meaning.

- The author recounts how these perceptions have changed over time (照母山 from wilderness to ""center""), indicating the social recognition and evolution of intra-city spatial categories.

- This clearly corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as the author implicitly endorses these local spatial perceptions as standards for defining what is considered ""urban"" or ""local area.""

- There is mention of family residence history (grandmother and mother lived in 较场口, father in 摊子口), but no explicit or implicit argument that this family rootedness defines local identity. It is background information.

- No mention of administrative hukou or legal status.

- No mention of dialect, language, or cultural habits.

- No mention of property ownership or social embeddedness as identity criteria.

- No mention of occupational typification.

Step 4: Output the results:

Output: RL1"

Output: RL3","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 500107 (likely a postal code or area code)
- 两江新区 (Liangjiang New Area)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author states ""土生土长破区"" (born and raised in Pojie District), and ""现居两江新区"" (currently living in Liangjiang New Area).
- The phrase ""土生土长"" indicates the author emphasizes being born and raised locally as a standard for local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on ""土生土长"" (born and raised) reflects RL3: Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History.
- The mention of current residence does not explicitly relate to any recognition logic for local identity definition.
- No other recognition logics are clearly expressed or implied.

- 坡区 (Poqu)
- 杨家坪 (Yangjiaping)

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that they lived in Lianglukou during childhood, moved to Poqu at age eight, and since then have been around Yangjiaping.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author emphasizes their growth history and places of residence since childhood. This suggests using family rootedness or individual growth history as a standard for defining ""local person"" identity.

Step 4: Output the result:

是不是开始有成都口音了,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: ""成都"" (Chengdu)

Step 2: The author mentions ""开始有成都口音了"" (""starting to have Chengdu accent""), implying the presence or acquisition of the local dialect/accent.

Step 3: This relates to linguistic-cultural recognition, i.e., RL4, because the author references the local dialect (accent) as a marker of local identity.

Step 4: Output the result.

整个重庆主城区都主要是本地人，重庆不像那些真一线城市那么多移民，最近几年才开始多起来外地口音移居过来的。,RL4,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 重庆 (Chongqing), 主城区 (main urban area)

Step 2: Viewpoint statements: The author states that the entire main urban area of Chongqing is mainly composed of locals. Compared to true first-tier cities, Chongqing has fewer migrants. Recently, there have been more people moving in with non-local accents.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis: The author emphasizes that the main urban area is mainly locals, and notes the presence of migrants with different accents. The mention of ""外地口音"" (non-local accents) as a marker of recent migrants implies that accent or dialect is a criterion for defining locals. Therefore, the author implicitly endorses linguistic-cultural recognition (RL4). The mention of the main urban area being mostly locals suggests an understanding of a spatial scope, but the author does not specify or define the boundary or symbolic meaning of areas beyond the administrative division. There is no explicit mention of administrative legitimacy or family rootedness. The emphasis is on the linguistic/cultural marker (accent) and spatial scope (main urban area). The spatial scope here is general and not elaborated as a vernacular spatial authority. Therefore, RL4 is definitely included. RL1 is not strongly supported because the author does not elaborate on intra-city spatial categories or collective emotional maps. RL2 is not supported because there is no mention of hukou or administrative boundaries. RL3 is not supported because no mention of family roots. RL5, RL6, RL7 are not mentioned.

Step 4: Output the result.

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that those who live close by (""挨得近"") are ""土生土长的"" (born and raised locally).
- This implies the author uses the criterion of being born and raised locally to define a ""local person.""

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The phrase ""土生土长的"" directly relates to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History).
- No mention of other logics such as administrative status, dialect, or property.

- 解放碑五一路
- 500103 (likely a code for a local area or administrative division)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author claims that people ""土生土长的"" (born and raised locally) at 解放碑五一路 have a specific code ""500103,"" and this is uncontested.
- The author uses being ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) as a criterion for local identity.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- ""土生土长"" (born and raised locally) points to family rootedness or individual growth history as a criterion for local identity → RL3.
- The mention of ""500103"" (a code) also hints at an administrative division or legitimacy, but the focus is on the ""born and raised"" part, so RL2 might be less central here.
- The author is emphasizing ""土生土长"" as a standard, so RL3 is clearly endorsed.

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The author uses the administrative division changes (九龙坡 to 大渡口) to define or locate their ""local"" identity.  
- The mention of the 510203 code (likely an administrative code) further supports the administrative boundary logic.  
- The mention of specific places (城头、大溪沟、枣子岚垭、和平路) is about family roots but mainly to support the administrative place identity.  
- The main logic is about administrative legitimacy (hukou, administrative division) to define local identity.

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:  
The author defines ""土著"" (local/native) as those who have lived in the area since the era when 解放碑 was the commercial center, specifically people living in 两江三岸. This implies a standard of historical rootedness in a particular spatial area.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:  
- The author uses a historical spatial boundary (解放碑 commercial center era, 两江三岸) as a criterion for defining ""local person."" This corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because the author relies on a historically defined spatial area to define local identity.  
- The focus on having lived there since that era also implies a temporal family or personal rootedness, matching RL3 (Family Rootedness).

- 渝中区 (Yuzhong District)
- 九龙坡区 (Jiulongpo District)

Step 2: Match arguments:
- The author states that their father moved from Yuzhong District to Jiulongpo District 50 years ago due to work, and because he had a house, the hukou (household registration) was transferred to Jiulongpo.
- The author notes that at that time, there was no concept of house price appreciation.
- The author regrets not holding onto the hukou in Yuzhong District because commuting was difficult (green train).

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author uses hukou (household registration) as a criterion to define or mark ""local person"" identity since the father's hukou transfer is highlighted as significant.
- The mention of having a house leading to hukou transfer and the regret about not keeping hukou in Yuzhong suggests administrative legitimacy as a standard.
- The author does not mention dialect, family roots, or social embeddedness explicitly.
- The focus is on hukou and administrative transfer as a defining factor.

- 月亮岛  
- 梅溪湖  
- 老长沙  
- 新城区  
- 湖南省内地级市  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- 伍家岭 and 南二环: The author defines the local spatial boundary mentally from north to south, suggesting these as limits for what counts as local, and not recognizing areas beyond as local but as ""乡下"" (countryside).  
- 新城区 (new urban area): Described as having many high-rise buildings, high population density, traffic congestion, and lacking the cultural ""烟火气"" (local cultural atmosphere) of 老长沙. Also employment and infrastructure differ.  
- 老长沙 (old Changsha): Has lower density, cultural atmosphere, and is emotionally recognized as the true local city by the author.  
- General emphasis on 配套 (supporting facilities) as the key factor for long-term local acceptance and recognition.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The mental boundary defining local area from 伍家岭 to 南二环 and rejection of areas beyond as ""乡下"" is a shared habitual local perception of spatial categories, i.e., Vernacular Spatial Authority (RL1).  
- The emphasis on 老长沙's cultural atmosphere and the lack thereof in new districts indicates a cultural-linguistic recognition of local identity, i.e., Linguistic-Cultural Recognition (RL4).  
- The focus on 配套 (infrastructure, convenience) as essential for recognizing a place as truly local points to Functional Livability (RL5).

- 南门口 (Nanmenkou)
- 八角亭 (Bajiaoting)
- 老城区 (Old city district)
- 梅溪湖 (Meixi Lake)
- 城里 (city center/downtown)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author claims they grew up in the old city district (老城区), describing it as a place where neighbors are familiar and close-knit, with neighbors warmly greeting and asking about family when visiting old homes. This implies a recognition of old city district as a core local area with strong social ties.
- The author currently lives in Meixi Lake (梅溪湖), likes living there due to its liveliness, convenience for children’s schooling, and ease of walking by the lake at night.
- For social activities like meeting friends and shopping, the author prefers going to the ""city center"" (城里).
  
Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The emphasis on growing up in the old city district and the familiar, warm relationships with neighbors reflects RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as it stresses being born and raised locally, and social embeddedness from childhood.
- The description of neighbors being familiar and warmly greeting also points to RL6 (Social Embeddedness), emphasizing social roots and local community ties.
- The author also expresses a preference for the ""city center"" for social activities, and describes Meixi Lake as a good place to live due to convenience, vitality, and environmental quality, which aligns with RL5 (Functional Livability).

- 长沙 (Changsha)
- 武汉 (Wuhan)
- 侯家塘 (Houjiatang)
- 步行街 (Pedestrian Street)
- 河西 (Hexi)
- 黄鹤楼 (Yellow Crane Tower)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author compares Changsha with other cities, noting that their internal standard of distance or local area perception differs.
- The author recounts a relative from Wuhan who drove out of Changsha city limits unknowingly, implying Changsha’s administrative boundaries are recognized.
- The author’s childhood perception defines the furthest local distance as from Houjiatang to the pedestrian street.
- The author expresses a feeling that although Hexi is nice (few cars, small parks), it is too far from home.
- The author’s sister lives near Yellow Crane Tower, but the taxi fare is 30 RMB, which the author implies is far.
- The author emphasizes that their ""nearby"" is reachable by walking.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author’s emphasis on personal and childhood perception of distance and local scope (e.g., the furthest distance considered local, ""my nearby is reachable by foot"") reflects a vernacular, habitual spatial perception that is not based on administrative boundaries but on personal and collective emotional maps. This aligns with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority).
- The mention of ""长沙市"" (Changsha city) and the relative driving out of the city implies an awareness of administrative boundaries, but the author focuses more on personal distance perception rather than strictly legal boundaries. The administrative boundary is mentioned but not used as a core standard by the author for defining ""local person."" Therefore, RL2 is not strongly endorsed by the author.
- There is no mention of family rootedness, dialect, social embeddedness, livability functions, or occupational typification as standards for defining ""local person.""
- The emphasis is on the spatial/cognitive emotional map of what counts as local in Changsha, which differs from other cities.

哈哈哈，二环的乡里别给你点赞,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 二环 (Second Ring Road area)

Step 2: The author mentions ""二环的乡里"" (people from the Second Ring Road area, implied to be ""乡里"" - which can mean locals or people from the countryside or less urbanized area within the second ring). The author says ""别给你点赞"" (don't give you likes), which is a dismissive or mocking tone towards these people.

Step 3: Recognition logic analysis:

- The mention of ""二环"" (Second Ring Road) implies a spatial classification within the city, which aligns with RL1 Vernacular Spatial Authority, as it refers to a common spatial categorization (Second Ring Road) used to distinguish locals.

- The use of ""乡里"" might imply a social or cultural identity, but here it's more a derogatory label for people from that area, so it may imply some social/cultural boundary.

- However, the author is mocking the ""二环的乡里,"" implying that people from that area are not worthy of praise. This suggests the author is using spatial classification to judge or define local identity.

- There is no mention of administrative divisions, family roots, dialect, livability, social embeddedness, or occupation.

Step 4: Output:

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
- The author was born and raised in 五一广场.
- After marriage, the author lives in 梅溪湖.
- The parents say the author has ""gone to the countryside, a place where birds don’t poop,"" implying that 梅溪湖 is considered a remote or less desirable place by the parents.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The parents' evaluation of 梅溪湖 as a ""乡里"" (countryside) and ""鸟不拉屎的地方"" (a very remote or backward place) implies a vernacular spatial authority logic about what counts as ""local"" or ""core"" urban area. The parents see the move as going outside the ""real"" local area.
- The author mentions birth and upbringing location (五一广场), indicating family rootedness and individual growth history as a standard.
- The parents’ statement implies a difference in spatial recognition of ""local"" areas, reflecting RL1.
- The author’s statement about where they were born and raised is an implicit assertion of local identity based on growth history (RL3).

Step 2: The author questions whether Houjiatang counts as part of the Old Town. The author points out that the area around Tianjian Road may not be comfortable to live in, challenging the idea that the Old Town is superior or not congested.

Step 3: The author is discussing the spatial boundary of what counts as the Old Town (local core area) and challenges the positive stereotype of the Old Town by describing the living conditions (comfort, congestion). The question ""侯家塘算不？"" (Does Houjiatang count?) implies a consideration of local spatial boundaries (RL1). The mention of comfort and traffic conditions relates to livability (RL5). However, the author seems to deny the ""Old Town is not congested"" superiority claim, so this may not be an endorsement of RL5 as a local identity standard but rather a critique.

The main focus is on whether Houjiatang is considered part of the Old Town local area, which is a vernacular spatial boundary question (RL1).

Step 4: The author implicitly uses RL1 (vernacular spatial authority) to question local area boundaries. The mention of livability (RL5) is more of a critique and not an endorsed standard to define local identity.

Output: RL1"
哪有那么多原因，就是习惯了啊，家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在。另外，南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路。,"RL1, RL3","Step 1: Identify named entities mentioned in the text  
- 南二环 (South Second Ring Road)  
- 劳动路 (Laodong Road)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
- The author says ""家在亲戚朋友也在，上班也在"" (""home, relatives and friends are here, work is also here""), implying a standard of defining ""local person"" by habitual residence, social connections, and work location.  
- The author states ""南到南二环是不可能的，顶多到劳动路"" (""South to South Second Ring Road is impossible, at most to Laodong Road""), implying a spatial boundary for what counts as ""local,"" restricting the southern limit of the ""local"" area.  

Step 3: Analyze the underlying recognition logic behind each viewpoint statement  
- The emphasis on habitual presence (home, relatives, work) relates to RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History) and possibly RL6 (Social Embeddedness), but the mention is more about habitual presence and social ties, closer to RL3.  
- The spatial boundary statement about the southern limit corresponds to RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority), as it reflects a local perception of city spatial boundaries defining ""local"" areas.  

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL1, RL3"
嘴巴放干净点，啥都不懂。湘江新区是功能区而非行政区，岳麓区委、区政府与湘江新区党工委、管委会实行区政合一的运行方式。,Recognition Logic 2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New Area)
- 岳麓区 (Yuelu District)

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity:
- The author states that 湘江新区 is a functional area, not an administrative district.
- The author explains the governance structure involving 岳麓区委、区政府 and 湘江新区党工委、管委会 in a unified operational mode.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
- The author emphasizes that 湘江新区 is not an administrative district but a functional zone, and clarifies the administrative governance relationship.
- This focuses on the official administrative status and legitimacy.
- There is no indication that the author uses this to define ""local person"" identity, but the discussion centers on administrative boundaries and legitimacy.
- According to RL2, appeals to administrative division or official jurisdiction are relevant.
- The author does not oppose this standard and seems to clarify it as a basis for understanding area identity.
- No other recognition logics are involved here.

Step 4: Output result:

Output: Recognition Logic 2"
你看看现在有没有岳麓区人民法院，岳麓区zf，地图上是显示岳麓区还是湘江新区，湘江新区只是经济发展上的特殊区划，又不是行政区划,":
Output: RL2","Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 岳麓区人民法院 (Yuelu District People's Court)
- 岳麓区政府 (Yuelu District government)
- 岳麓区 (Yuelu District)
- 湘江新区 (Xiangjiang New Area)

Step 2: Match arguments to entities:
The author questions whether the court and government are shown on the map as part of 岳麓区 or 湘江新区, and states that 湘江新区 is only a special economic development zone, not an administrative division.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
The author distinguishes between economic development zones and administrative divisions, emphasizing that 湘江新区 is not an administrative division. This reflects the use of official administrative boundaries and legal status as the basis for defining the area or identity.

Step 4: Output results:
Output: RL2"
确实，湘江新区只是个功能区，行政区还是叫岳麓区，湘江新区相当于岳麓再加望城区的一些地方,RL2,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 湘江新区
- 岳麓区
- 望城区

Step 2: Match arguments:
The author states that 湘江新区 is just a functional area, and administratively it is still called 岳麓区; 湘江新区 corresponds to 岳麓 plus some parts of 望城区.

Step 3: Analyze recognition logic:
The author is emphasizing the administrative division status, pointing out that 湘江新区 is not an independent administrative district but a functional area within existing administrative districts. This reflects an appeal to administrative legitimacy as the standard for defining areas.

Step 4: Output the recognition logic:
RL2 (Administrative Legitimacy)

范围大点只有天心区算城区，其他都是乡里别比如雨花区，我就住这，以前全是菜地，我老公土生土长的坡子街人，他说老城区只有坡子街那一块小破地，什么开福区雨花区都没人住的荒郊野地，更别说河西的岳麓区啊跳马啊望城了，那更加不算,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned:
- 天心区 (Tianxin District)
- 雨花区 (Yuhua District)
- 坡子街 (Pozi Street)
- 开福区 (Kaifu District)
- 河西 (Hexi)
- 岳麓区 (Yuelu District)
- 跳马 (Tiaoma)
- 望城 (Wangcheng)

Step 2: Match arguments to each entity:
- The author claims only Tianxin District counts as the urban core area.
- Other districts like Yuhua, Kaifu, Yuelu, Tiaoma, Wangcheng are described as rural or ""荒郊野地"" (desolate countryside).
- The author's husband, a native of Pozi Street (a part of the old city), says the old city is only the small area of Pozi Street.
- The author implies that areas outside Tianxin and Pozi Street are not considered ""real"" urban or local core areas.

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic:
- The author and husband use local, vernacular spatial perceptions to define which areas count as the ""old city"" or ""urban core"" (e.g., only Tianxin and Pozi Street count, others do not).
- This is not based on official administrative boundaries but on shared local knowledge and historical settlement patterns.
- The author distinguishes between ""urban core"" and ""countryside"" based on collective local understandings of space.

Step 4: Output the results:
Output: RL1"
小时候住南门口，大一点住八角亭，然后去了捞刀河，接着又住到暮云，最后住到了梅溪湖，变成了xlb 哈哈哈哈哈哈,RL3,"Step 1: Named entities mentioned: 南门口, 八角亭, 捞刀河, 暮云, 梅溪湖

Step 2: The author narrates a personal history of moving through various places during childhood and growing up, ending up at 梅溪湖 and self-identifying as ""xlb"" (possibly a local nickname or identity).

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The author uses the sequence of places lived during childhood and growth as a basis to define or affirm their local identity.
- This reflects RL3 (Family Rootedness / Individual Growth History), as the author emphasizes their personal growth trajectory through local areas to establish their ""local"" identity.
- No explicit mention of administrative status, dialect, social embeddedness, or occupational types.
- No mention of vernacular spatial authority as a standard.
- No mention of livability or social embeddedness.

Step 4: Output the recognized category:

Output: RL3"
哈是乡里别，哪有城里人,RL1,"Step 1: Identify named entities  
- ""乡里"" (countryside/village)  
- ""城里人"" (city people)  

Step 2: Match arguments to each named entity  
The author contrasts ""乡里"" and ""城里人,"" implying a distinction between rural locals and urban locals. The phrase ""哈是乡里别"" suggests a categorical difference or separation based on place of origin or residence.  

Step 3: Analyze underlying recognition logic  
The author uses spatial or social categories (""乡里"" vs ""城里人"") as a basis for defining who is local or not. This reflects a vernacular spatial classification and possibly a social embeddedness or occupational typification logic. However, the phrase is very brief and only clearly indicates a spatial or social boundary between rural and urban locals. There is no explicit mention of administrative status, family roots, dialect, livability, or property. The main basis is the spatial and social distinction. This aligns best with RL1 (Vernacular Spatial Authority) because the author is distinguishing locals based on a culturally recognized spatial/social division (rural vs urban).  

Step 4: Output the results  
Output: RL1"
我在五一广场 有个同事不知道我们经理就是那个月亮岛那里的，然后他就说乡里别 然后我们经理就说那里已经属于是开发区了，不属于是乡里了，然后我同事还没理解意思，一直在吐槽那里不好不好，结果我们经理就背后面针对他，懂得都懂,Recognition Logic 2,"Step 1: Named entities: 五一广场, 月亮岛, 开发区

Step 2: Viewpoint statements:
- 同事说月亮岛那里的经理是“乡里别”（乡下人）
- 经理回应月亮岛已经属于开发区了，不属于乡里了
- 同事不理解，吐槽月亮岛不好
- 经理背后针对同事

Step 3: Underlying recognition logic:
- The经理 uses the fact that月亮岛属于开发区（行政区划）来否认“乡里”身份，这是基于行政合法性标准，即行政区划界定身份。
- 同事用“乡里”来形容经理，暗含乡村身份与城市身份的区分，但作者没有明确表达认同这一观点，只是描述事件。
- 作者未明确表达对“乡里”或“开发区”身份认定的态度，但经理用行政区划来界定身份，说明作者认可行政区划作为身份界定标准。

Step 4: Output:
Output: Recognition Logic 2"
住北正街的算乡里别中的城里人,RL1,"Step 1: Named entities: 北正街

Step 2: The author states that those who live on 北正街 are considered ""城里人"" within the ""乡里别"" (local identity distinctions). This implies a spatial boundary or categorization based on the specific area.

Step 3: The author uses a spatial/cognitive boundary (which area counts as local city residents) based on habitual local perceptions or historical local understandings.

Step 4: Output: RL1"
